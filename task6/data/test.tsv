0	107301	Given that the average survival rate to this virus is 99%, who will take the vaccine? I sure won’t. Never took a flu vaccine either.
1	105412	@FrDaveNix I hear belief in the virus will be added to the Credo.I believe in one coronavirus....and its only begotten vaccine.
2	201657	The CDC recommends receiving your second COVID-19 vaccine dose three weeks after getting the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and one month after receiving the first Moderna shot. But what happens if you miss your second vaccine appointment? https://t.co/JZ5bRrdNpf
3	107587	Just in case you’re wondering. I’m never having the vaccine. Whatever if threatened or offered. I’ll die before I take it. #COVID19 #covid1984 #vaccine
4	106375	@EssexPR @sailorrooscout This is very strange though. We know the flu vaccine has only ever been 20-40% effective, yet a brand new coronavirus vaccine is effective not only for current variants, but all the new ones too 🤔
5	201665	A COVID-19 vaccine update:2,191 #Windsor-Essex residents have received their first dose only, while 9,888 have received two doses. A total of 21,967 doses have been administered to area residents.
6	106873	@Foward44 @NBSaphierMD It's far fetched to call this a vaccine when it doesn't even give you any immunity to catching the disease unlike actual vaccines. And besides, needing 3 jabs a year too is just ridiculous for a 0.096% mortality rate Coronavirus.
7	106338	@realDonaldTrump Yes, but are humans too Mr. Trump, The coronavirus is burying all American warriors. They have the technology to go to the moon, but to find a vaccine they are screwed.
8	107068	@nshealth When is the Covid-19 dashboard going to be updated to reflect vaccine uptake in the 5-11 year old group?
9	201513	#COVID19Vaccine side affect; soreness and swelling in my arm and insanely vivid and crazy dreams. Holy shit in one of them I was a beast 😂 lol #COVID19 #CovidVaccine and I haven’t even had the 2nd dose yet
10	105466	I don’t even think why they’re refuse the Vaccine, At this point it’s like Kids Fighting Sleep, You know this is good for you, you just don’t want to be told what to do. #vaccine #Vaccination #COVID19 #CovidVaccine #GetVaccinated #GettheVaccine
11	201498	This afternoon @GovBillLee is at the White House for a COVID-19 Vaccine Roundtable. He was just recognized by @realDonaldTrump, and appears to be one of just a handful of governors in the room.
12	105471	@DebraG_Robins No, but given the process usually takes 10 years plus and we have never produced a vaccine for a coronavirus, I think 2 years is optimistic.
13	106093	@Sheepdog_89 @yourclueless2 @GovMikeDeWine Are we breaking down into absurdities because me being rational was too hard for you? Colds have medicine. Flu has a vaccine. Coronavirus does not.
14	106353	@SportsnetPR It is wholly irresponsible for your broadcasters to be saying that people need to make their own decisions about getting the COVID-19 vaccine. They should either encourage everyone to get one when it’s their turn, or say nothing at all.
15	106520	@thebradfordfile @MsAvaArmstrong It's a distraxine. No vaccine has ever been approved for a coronavirus (35% of common cold viruses)We don't need one (99.9% nonlethal)The test is whether you have testes or not.
16	105928	"""I am speaking out because to combat this deadly virus, science -- not politics or cronyism -- has to lead the way."" - Rick Bright, after he was abruptly dismissed from leading the coronavirus vaccine development team because he wasn't aligned with what the @POTUS wanted to do!"
17	107164	@JanssenUS I spent 5 months last year in the hospital and nursing facility didn't get COVID-19 my doctor told me never get that vaccine i don't like vaccines and never needed one
18	106343	The hoarders will see how a vaccine doesn't care what's in storage, and those countries where it is unavailable will continue to impact the vaccinated countries until Covid is eradicated. #VaccineApartheid
19	107657	"Coronaviruses are in every animal so if you've ever had a flu vaccine you were injected with #coronavirus"". Wonder if this is why #fluvaccine is being pushed so enthusiastically this year in the UK...2nd wave 'n all that..."
20	105921	@HummelTown @MattWalshBlog Do you get hepatitis, polio and measles after you have gotten the vaccine?   Can you still get COVID-19 after the “vaccine??   Hello!!
21	106368	if this is true then 1) the vaccine doesn't work and 2) we were lied to and 3) do we really want to do the NEXT insane thing they try to make us do? I sure as heck don't!
22	106065	@urkagurka If some already had prior immunity, like my 89 year old mother had, It's lasting and we have nothing to worry aboutOnce encountered and recovered from any of this crop of Coronavirus variants we don't need a vaccine at allIt would not give benefitClear enough now
23	107026	@courtlynn30 - 2I'm actually think, maybe I go out and get Covid19, so they will FRICKIN' leave me alone when the Mandatory Vaccine comes....
24	106444	Um, did they need a placebo group because they didn't know the effects of Covid19 with no prophylactic treatment? If so, they are the wrong group to be putting together any vaccine I would be willing to try.
25	105835	@thehill Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
26	105421	First refugee in the world to receive a coronavirus vaccine was in Jordan, a country of very limited resources. What an inspiration King Abdullah is to the rest of the world.
27	201500	Got it today. First jab of Covid19 vaccination in PHC Bhagwati Nagar. Thankyou @narendramodi ji #IndianScientists #RakeHangloo ji and @BJP4India https://t.co/plCYsIoxlm
28	106726	At this point anyone still telling people not to get the Vaccine or not to take the #coronavirus seriously is just a platinum certified idiot and should be treated as such...the #media should stop treating them like folks with a different opinion.They are simply morons
29	106079	I love this. As soon as I can find an appt I should be able to get my #CovidVaccine too. It's been a week since I became eligible as a person who is immunosuppressed.
30	107078	Trending that 30 crore Indian's should get free #COVID19 vaccine  free of cost. Then rest 102 crores? Which system is it? Don't understand. We want vaccine for all Indian's. ❤#VaccineForAll #Covid19India
31	107159	@angrypengu1n They are eluding to “they can’t force you to get it, but they can make continued employment conditional on getting the #Covid19 #vaccine” which I thought was essentially coercion.
32	105636	@SKyriakidesEU @AstraZeneca Those vaccines do not work on a new virus/strain. How many different/vaccines do you want to be injected?  Two or three or 5? If you do, then think of an pig experiment. Those coronavirus is a new beginning. The rest will be a real racing.
33	106712	"You can't keep locking us down until there's a vaccine, you imbecile. You have no idea when that will  be, or even if it will ever happen.  Personally, I feel as safe as I ever have, and I owe you nothing. There is no ""we""."
34	105565	If COVID-19 is so deadly why is it that the BAME who are refusing to take the vaccines and refuse to social distance aren’t all dropping dead🤔
35	105856	So, in other words, if you want your life back then vaccinations become mandatory?? @InstituteGC you actually want to take away people rights to do normal things if they don't have the vaccine?? This is insane!! What has this country come too...
36	105854	Wait a minute, how TF does this work?Is the goal here to help the vaccine recipient or the vaccine creators?  @PsychSavant
37	107368	Just wait until they start with the worst coronavirus yet when they blame it for everyone dying but it really was the jabbathehut
38	105597	@QuestionerMoney @Kean1S @allymaclusk @NicolaSturgeon Yes, I know flu has vaccines. Usually between 20% - 60% effective. My point being, even with a vaccine we haven't achieved elimination. There are reasons we've never developed a coronavirus vaccine other than not being able to. I don't doubt there could be a vaccine sometime.
39	105930	I’m certain this is going to be the only mishap in these vaccine rollouts. BUT GO GET ONE OR YOU CAN NEVER LEAVE YOUR HOUSE.
40	106510	The government’s policy on #COVID19 can be summed up as: “If you survive, or don’t get long Covid, well done. If you do, it’s not our fault. We’re not going to do anything to mitigate infections; we’ll keep our fingers crossed that the vaccines will save you’.Or: good luck
41	105400	@ellencarmichael People, including the government, need to stop waiting for a vaccine. It might never come. We've not been successful with finding good vaccines for coronavirus before. We need a different, realistic plan.
42	106071	Biden’s COVID-19 strategy for vaccine distribution and economy recovery is so normal that it is incredibly shocking to my system. That’s how bad it’s been. 100 million vaccines in 100 days is shocking to my system. That is all.
43	107486	Hey Alison would it be a bit late to submit “ name the first person who received the COVID-19 vaccine “ to the big  Christmas quiz this Thursday 🤔☺️☘️
44	106982	"@DrKND @apropoofnothing Speaking of the phenomenon of ""virus interference"",Dr. Rick Kirschner wrote: ""It's like a one-two punch. Flu vax sets it up, coronavirus delivers the knock out blow."" Or perhaps the coronavirus vaccine sets you up to be vulnerable to the next virus coming down the pike."

46	107433	@AlanRMacLeod @venanalysis @CancilleriaVE @maduro_en @camilateleSUR 1) to be fair, this is the appropriations bill, in which the coronavirus relief bill was tacked on to..2) BUT... $33 million to meddle in Venezuela’s business when there are hospitals in our country with 0% ICU capacity in a pandemic + not enough vaccines for everyone. okay!
47	105645	As someone who has had two jabs, I support the international vaccine programmeBut why is there a misleading sticker on this?
48	105941	“I am afraid — and people don’t like to hear this, but I’m kind of constantly preaching it — we have to prepare ourselves for the idea we do not have a very good vaccine. My guess is the first generation of vaccines may be mediocre.”
49	106357	@latimes I've some great examples too. I've a sister who keeps feeding my mom lies, and gets angry when my mom doesn't agree with her. She and her husband told my parents that Covid19 isn't real, that they shouldn't take the vaccine because it's a gov scam.
50	201580	so my external ovaries ARE supposed to swell from the Covid-19 Vaccine.. correct? Okay, good. Just making sure.
51	106673	The Vaccines to the Virus that Trump supporters think that is a hoaxThe Vaccines that Trump supporters will implant an microchip into their bodies..Honestly they are so insane that even though they think these things that they will applaud him for what he's said
52	105576	Got my vaccine. If I understand conspiracy theories correctly, I am now have the most recent Windows update moving through my bloodstream and will soon receive my recruitment orders to support my Lizard overlords. #COVID19 #VaccinatedAF
53	107441	@Vscarp20 If you’re not angry about COVID-19 you should get angry. This is not ending soon. This is only the beginning. They estimate this may ebb and flow for YEARS until we develop substantial herd immunity (or a safe vaccine is created). Years. Not weeks. Not months. Years.
54	201574	This is so very sad! “I trusted my government and they lied to me.” I took took the vaccine to protect my son, “taking the vax is like playing Russian roulette” His son died from the vaccine. #vaccine #jab #VAXXED #VaccineSideEffects #vaccineinjuries #Biden #BreakingNews #Doctors

56	107567	I'm starting to believe the left isn't actually taking the vaccine but pretending they are for optics!🤷🏻‍♀️
57	106576	TOMORROW!!! In September they said this “There are currently no plans to place restrictions on those who refuse to have any potential covid-19 vaccine.” Has anything they've done since them given you confidence they are honest?

61	107440	I certainly wouldn’t take it! I’ll take my chances with the flu thanks. #covid #putin #russia #vaccine
62	107427	@DonnyDonowitz10 @pmarkhemming Currently Covid19 vaccines are not included in the Government's vaccine damage compensation scheme. One has to wonder why.
63	107356	@bigpictureroxi I don't know if everyone realizes just how remarkable the human accomplishment of the Coronavirus vaccines truly is.
64	107053	So after vaccine, WHEN you get covid, you could have milder illness. But you’ll still be infectious SO you can still carry and transmit the virus. How’s that going to control the spread since vaccinated people are allowed to move around etc?
65	105903	@daosouthwest @simondolan The Pfizer vaccine has upwards of 90% effectiveness.So if you take it you probably won't get Covid-19.If you don't have Covid-19 you can't give it to anyone else.Seems like a good idea to me.
66	106972	Wow. &amp; good. @DeptVetAffairs is now making COVID19 vaccines mandatory for all heath care personnel. I wonder if/when they will expand the mandate to everyone working in a medical center like they do for the flu shot?
67	105738	So if the letters in the word Corona add up to 666 doesn't that mean that the Coronavirus is evil and from the Devil? It wouldn't mean the vaccine would be evil. The vaccine would be the opposite.
68	105480	@roper_93 We don't need a vaccine because he has banished COVID19.  No one else has become sick or died since he banished it. Thank Jeebus for Copeland! And for those who are going to come at me, this is sarcasm.
69	105650	@MoshPunksNFT hehe, I don't really love the Metal Zone(even though it can sound good when everything is fully cranked). My tweet was about getting the Covid-19 vaccine.
70	105468	It’s very scary that approx  50% of the British Population and American Population are crying to get fed their Vaccine 💉 , it’s taken a year to get this one approved, yet it takes 15 years to get a relatively reliable vaccine.. #Vaccin #hoax #COVID19 #usa #uk #Agenda21 #antiVax
71	106277	You can get a vaccine exemption if you've already taken the vaccine.Kinda like dunking a witch and if she drowned, she wasn't a witch, isnt it?
72	105778	Total USA population is approximately 330MM. What percent do you think will take any #COVID19 vaccine this year. Choose closest range.
73	106964	I’m disappointed but not surprised that there’s no way to register for the vaccine in the state of Virginia when you’re in a qualified group. @VDHgov @GovernorVA @MarkWarner
74	106242	2 weeks ago my family made the incredibly difficult decision to move my father-in-law into a nursing home amidst such strange and challenging times. Today he received his first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and I am so very thankful.
75	105575	Wouldn’t it be funny if China developed the first successfully affective COVID-19 vaccine &amp; tRump would have grovel to get it for the U.S.? They would share of course!
76	201619	Today I added a layer of protection against this virus with my first COVID-19 vaccine! I’m keeping myself, my loved ones and the rest of Ontarians safe from COVID-19. Thank you to Dr. Shivani and the entire team for doing an amazing work at Cornell community centre. https://t.co/IGyxAvsCpS
77	106376	@CDCgov I will not get the vaccine. I will go where I please. I will not submit. I've already had covid-19 and am alive and well! I was neither treated with nor prescribed a z-pak, antibiotics, hydroxychloriqine, or antivirals. My own 51-year old immune system was and will be sufficient.
78	105326	Why are politicians not participating in this #COVID19 vaccine trial? If they're meant to be looking after us surely they should be the ones who test it out first.
79	106870	@reubing @SarahJRossiter2 Curious aren't the flu shots tainted with the flu would that mean the Coronavirus shot is also meaning that a vaccine already exists and why important people are getting the virus
80	106602	So from what I’ve researched SARS, which is a coronavirus, just disappeared without a vaccine.Interesting.
81	106716	Black and Brown do not take a vaccine please be aware of it be notice My people May God protect and guide us
82	107499	Brazil has a very contagious variant. It's important that the US sends our best vaccines around the world to protect all peoples. Biden has made a commitment, but none will leave until end of June.
83	201682	The vaccine-induced reduction in my anxiety was starting to creep me out. Good thing I have good reason to feel so anxious again that my cortisol levels spike.
84	107523	I couldn’t articulate it exactly, but this is exactly what my complaint is right now with respect to the “debate” about boosters. The only questions they need to answer are: 1) is it safe? 2) will it help protect you?Then let people decide for themselves.
85	105279	as long as pi is everlasting there will be no effective and safe vaccine for coronavirus @LuciferDaily @federalreserve @ThelIluminatii
86	107525	@MelissaFloBix I actually meant what I said. I am ashamed to be a Finnish person and know that our government doesn’t supply Covid-19 vaccines to less privileged countries. Currently my country leaders hold the vaccines just in case they will someday give the booster shots.
87	106284	@sajidjavid can you please chase up the process for getting immune compromised people the third primary vaccine . There is a lot of confusion and no jabbing going on.#vaccine #COVID19 #needabooster
88	105386	Good news! Biden is doing such a great job handling the coronavirus that we don't need to take the vaccine!
89	106752	@JainNirmal Yes Mr Nirmal. However this prolly is beacuse #china already has a vaccine for #COVID19 . But yes sooner this will get resolved.
90	106137	THIS is why I'm really not in a rush to get the vaccine. Or planning on doing anything this summer. Or this Christmas.
91	106732	@TheEliKlein @CT_Bergstrom If you were trying to shield people from a static danger, say a toxic spill, the fix for the spill would protect everyone.  But Coronavirus is alive and constantly changing, quickly mutating to a form the vaccine doesn't stop.  (cont)
92	106204	@Ismwatcher_up @Chimmy31 @StarAdvertiser Oh, and if anyone had ever invented a single shot Coronavirus vaccine, they would be billionaires, because they would save farmers TRILLIONS. Doesn't Bill Gates research chicken coronavirus, hmmmm, wonder why, oh to make more BILLIONS!
93	107191	Just because the mandate has been lifted doesn’t mean I personally have lifted it for myself. Yes I am vaccinated. I just want to make sure I am safe so I will be wearing my mask until Ohio has higher vaccine numbers. It is my decision 😷
94	106564	@BriannaWu I don't agree with this second part. I had an adverse vaccine reaction due to autoimmune disease and the Covid-19 vaccine poses a risk to me, agreed by 3 doctors. That said, they wouldn't sign an exemption. There are a lot of us lost in this system.
95	201519	I’ve been on edge and frustrated all day. BUT...One glimmer of hope today is that my mom got her second COVID-19 vaccine shot. https://t.co/bFa1xaJr6v
96	107092	@djthefunkchris @aspidou @ksorbs Yea      BUT.    Over 150 million Flu shots are given out.... So unlike the coronavirus, which we have no vaccines for.... Get it? It's the flu without shots, gone wild.... You're an asshole too.
97	106586	Dear Jesus Christ,Please bring everyone back to normal, please doctor and nurse get the vaccine and booster vaccine for everyone and I need get the COVID-19 or coronavirus out of here so I want everyone to having normal lifeAmen 🙏🏻
98	106250	Hi this is Medium Roe Just wanting to let people know that this Coronavirus Plague is starting to mutate. My Spirit guide has informed me that three vaccines will be created and will not work. Why? Because the plague is mutating.

100	105804	I see Spotify memes everywhere. I love Neil Young &amp; am a very big fan! I HATE covid19 as it took my healthy mom last yr. I am triple vaxxed. However I don't at all agree w the mandates because they do not stop the spread!! Yes they prevent serious illness.
101	106295	I DID IT!!! Got my second #COVID19 jab today. I’m sooo happy, and so relieved! Now, if they would just lift some restrictions soon, I‘m so fed up with  being confined to my home, work and the occasional walk. Fingers crossed for all of you who still need to get vaccinated. 😄🎉🍾

108	106352	It's important to recognize that getting the COVID-19 vaccine is not safe because it was rapidly developed and tested.
109	106606	@DiscipleColin @wytewzrdz It's the reason we don't yet have a vaccine for HIV as ADE causes worse problems than the virus. It's also plagued every Coronavirus vaccine creation ever known, and yes 'they' knew the potential for ADE to be a prob with these new vaccines but went ahead anyway.
110	105300	@VMcIntyre13 @AddieCo76160156 @CMOH_Alberta Actually they are *incredibly* safe, even as vaccines go. Anti-vaxxer nonsense is not borne out by the millions of safely administered covid-19 vaccines administered so far.
111	107604	@kellieb926 @usual_suspect89 @AnaCabrera Is that what they do? Because I'm fairly sure we still have the flu, but there is a vaccine. It's meant to help protect you against dying or getting seriously ill, and to slow down the virus. It's unlikely that CoViD-19 will ever go away completely, but it can be controlled.
112	105966	Now that we know the risks, it's important those of us who've had the vaccine keep an eye out for any concerning symptoms. Please take note and share it around - the (VERY rare) clotting side effect is treatable if addressed promptly.

127	105674	"2. Given this is a respiratory virus, immunity likely won’t last.3. Lockdown is not the only alternative to seeking herd immunity.4. First tries at achieving COVID-19 herd immunity did not fare well.5. Even a vaccine likely won’t make human herds immune."""
128	107584	@DrZweliMkhize I don't know much about vaccines hey...the polio vaccine seemed to work...so maybe the Covid-19 vaccine will work if developed around more or less the same principles. I don't trust the conspiracy theories about the vaccine. If it's found I'll go for it...that's just me.
129	106015	@realTuckFrumper @DebbieParkes3 If we can coordinate to fight #COVID19, then we can work together to fix this too. I have no medical training, but I was able to put my IT skills to use last year to help, get researchers what they needed to develop a vaccine. I'm sure I can do the same again.
130	106128	Was there really a “reversal”? Or did DOH just stop counting in order for the order to be given to open up the economy. Is that when everyone started throwing away their masks? The cases are rising like gang busters now. DU30 wants to hand out free masks. Got vaccines???
131	106740	So has #tcnt !Pack those churches: Bill Gates is secretly putting microchips in to track you with the vaccine!Just kidding: That's beyond insane. Right Jon?
132	105368	@washingtonpost This is the BS articles before Biden takes office and then they give him credit for saving the nation from Coronavirus, even though President Trump did all the hard work to get us the vaccines approved and fast-tracked.
133	201521	I feel like wooden planks are attached to my neck.But I'm done editing from Kisumu, where more like me are finally taking their first Covid-19 jab.I also engaged hospital administration and the Governor on how Western Kenya is averting an infection crisis.All across BBC today. https://t.co/GUgOXUIKrc
134	105507	If only there were vaccines available. I'm in the high risk group and I'm still waiting for my first shot.We should be getting ready to start protesting, except it's not safe because we haven't had our vaccines yet.
135	105639	The vaccine really amped up my Gen X apathy levels. Haha j/kNo really, the vaccine allows me to focus all my anger &amp; rage at anti-vaxxers thru my eyes.#MyVaxxedSuperPower
136	107370	@SaltaoVladimir @EastOfEpworth @lnstigator_ @BallouxFrancois Sorry, but vaccine data do not support your optimistic assumptions about resuming “normality”Sorry, but there is no point for herd immunity for this virus but endemicity The faster we allow the virus recirculates among healthy people the better
137	106373	"Not because of ""that"" because of a tyrannical disgusting creature like draconian inhuman consciousness that does not belong on earth. We are not your slaves. Vaccine cards don't belong in the human race nor do humans deserve to be injected against their will."
138	106951	@ricksokugawa No reputable person has stated the vaccine prevents covid19 100% but that, if one does contract it, the chances of dying from it or being really sick are drastically reduced.
139	105623	@bodhibrian @SkyNews this early vaccine development project has been a hope stable for the current vaccine being developed. Prior to SARS-CoV-2, there was never a major threat by coronavirus as the one we’re seeing now. So the urgency to create a vaccine for them was more warranted.
140	107011	A new jobA new pathA new company.But im still safe and protected from my key element my blood and immune system 2 of 3 parts to my coronavirus triangle. 100% fully unvaccinated with no drug treatment no vaccines. My blood and immune system is what's keeping me going strong.
141	105717	Don’t be ignorant, Govt has enough funds to deal with pandemic and vaccine . It is upto individual to take care
142	107618	"They've only had a ""successful"" COVID-19 vaccine testing and I'm already planning my vacations for 2021/22🤣"
143	105422	@NotAlexSheppard I will let you know tomorrow.  My daughter has had COVID-19 then got the vaccine (both shots) and now she has COVID-19 symptoms again. We will take her to get tested tomorrow.
144	201593	@BDUTT @DeShobhaa @tavleen_singh @DILIPtheCHERIAN For your information. We all senior citizens got vaccines, my daughter &amp; son in law of 45 and my granddaughter of 21 got vaccine in Gujarat. No queues, no hasstle. Thanks to our beloved PM @narendramodi
145	106610	I'm fully vaxxed but I still wear mask because one there is Delta variant and two I don't know if I'm an asymptomatic carrier when there are others who are not yet vaxxed. I was young and unafraid once so I hope the young and daring can consider others and get #vaccine

148	107457	I just received the Pfizer vaccine to prevent Covid19.  I consider it #AShotOfHope. I hope it protects me so I can help keep my friends and family safe.  I really just wanna be able to HUG  my 80 year old Daddy soon!!!
149	106835	@catturd2 Luv you Mr catturd... but Covid is NOT  real.... it is only vitamin d deficiency and radio/cell tower sickness.  There is no covid19 virus because there are no viruses.  What we perceive as viruses are merely cellular debris. Beware the killer vaccine.
150	105380	Lol: It's not a waste, vaccine are 95% effective meaning it doesn't work in all circumstances. But it's better than zero % protection of not taking one. Normally those who survived virus will have immune but it's not always the case... It's complicated. #Covid19SA
151	105568	Okay. I know I have asked for a lot and Japan gov’t has ignored it all, but please please PLEASE may they stop ignoring the pandemic and approve this vaccine for kids super fast here. PLEASE.
152	105997	@ThomasEWoods There has never been a vaccine developed for any variant of coronavirus. I believe this will be the same.
153	107374	@notawokelefty @sailorrooscout @SteveBakerHW The human immune system has literally no reference for novel coronavirus. It only develops one once you either get COVID or you get the vaccine. And natural immunity is temporary, while vaccine immunity will be a lot longer-lasting if not permanent.
154	107298	Honestly when this Covid19 died down and a vaccine is found, everyone would treat it like a normal everyday influenza. So no need to panic at all.
155	107212	"Why is Fauci hesitant about a drug that we already have and can work to cure Coronavirus? Fauci is friends with B. Gates.  Is he stalling to approve Hydochloroquine because his ""friend "" is working on a new vaccine? Yet, Gates wants population control...🤔"
156	105744	Hey, @ASlavitt, it’s generally assumed a vaccine will help, but what is the current science on how much a vaccine really might help?*Will a vaccine truly result in immunity?*If so, how long will that immunity last?*Will it protect against COVID19 mutations?*Vaccine risks?
157	107134	Stay vigilant don't ease up don't become a stat. If you're not vaxxed yet...🤦‍♂️...get In the game. #Arizona
158	105285	Because if the government can't manipulate the young they'll pay the idols to do it for them..... we know the game which celebrity going to be first to push the new coronavirus vaccine saying they've had it and feel just fine 😂
159	107044	@JohnLukeSam1 I got the #COVID19 vaccine. I also like living, don't want to infect others, and I want to do my part to ensure #COVID19 doesn't spread throughout the country (it still is but I can't stop the deniers)  FYI: The needle didn't hurt. My arm did but only for a day or so.
160	107569	Lower drugs yes. But not a vaccine that has the Covid-19 virus in it.Read Creature from Jykell Island and Deep State:50 years... These people wants the population thinned out. Taking the vaccine could kill you any way
161	201722	Oh and you go home with a covid vaccination record card and a “i got my covid-19 vaccine” sticker (kinda like the  “i voted” sticker) haha 🙂
162	105212	It's too late! Hard pressed GP surgeries are already having to plan priority group 6. Just like the PPE guidance, unpaid carers are an afterthought. #unpaidcarers #vaccine #valuemycare @carersworldlive
163	105904	This article is fearmongering about the vaccine, under the guise that they don’t want to give antivaxxers more ammo. I’m taking the first COVID vaccine that my doctor says is safe for me and costs me under $100 after insurance. Even if side effects put me in bed for 3 days.
164	201520	Soon as I got the jab in my left arm my friend sends me a link to Costco nearby that has Johnson &amp; Johnson in stock so I can do a one and done. Got the J&amp;J in the right arm. No Covid-19 for me and I can continue to work.
165	105454	#nyct $alnov #avct #sng #tils #gdr Bill gates explaining why rushing the vaccine is problematic I will never use a rushed vaccine don’t care who makes it A normal process is 7-8 years bigger trials etc . It’s a dumb trial conducted by the pharma companies
166	106683	@AaronBlake @RonBrownstein The flu does not go away with a vaccine its still there.The coronavirus will not go away with a vaccine either,the vaccine will hopefully protect us from getting the virus .
167	105298	After we find the Coronavirus vaccine, can we work on an anti-moron vaccine? Blonks in Fluffy's replies truly need it.#LALISA #LISA
168	201616	Just tried to book my first and second COVID jabs online.I could get my first jab 2 miles from my house but I would have to travel 32 miles for my second jab when I don't drive.How the fuck is that going to help people get the vaccine!? Absolute mess of a system. #COVID19
169	105838	@SuzieWB101 假的Note: The above satire is fictional in that Mr.Gates has made no such speech and the Gates Foundation has not established any funds to compensate vaccine victims or to make available effective, inexpensive COVID-19 remedies. All the rest of the article is factual – W.Gelles
170	106834	Ok everyone it's been 6 months, even my degen gamer lifestyle requires some instances of social interaction once in awhile. Hoping we can get a vaccine/stop spread and get back to normal soon :(
171	105270	So who did they made it for when they don't even take it? People should never think of taking this poisonous vaccine
172	107443	@JpStrand27 It means somebody’s getting paid. 99.985% survival rate, even with the vaccine I can catch it &amp; spread it, so the vaccine literally does not make you safer. All the vaccine does, theoretically, is lower the severity of coronavirus if you get it. Like it or not this is the science
173	106630	I do not think the average public understands what ICU triage is. This is a very BASIC explanation: When there is not enough resources, staff or space to support you in the ICU, someone will live and someone will die. Please get vaccinated #COVID19AB #COVID19 #CovidVaccine
174	105777	I'm sorry if this isn't really a good thing to say but I'm not 100% sure if I want the coronavirus vaccine yet. I've honestly been really stressed lately and I don't think it's a good idea put even more pressure onto myself just yet, even though I am eligible for it.
175	106958	@POTUS Everyone, regardless of immigration status, should get vaccinated when possible. The vaccine is free, and there will be no immigration consequences for seeking COVID-19 testing, treatment, or vaccination. There is hope, but we can only get through the pandemic together.
176	107537	The issue is the people against vaccines who get covid won’t take these. It’s a good try but they will pull the same shit
177	106555	?????????good for them i guess??It's presented as though we're supposed to get mad about this but I don't really see why we should.North Koreans getting the vaccine is good, actually.
178	105275	Some people are actually refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine and while explaining their reasons why, they actually think this makes them sound intelligent.
179	105711	Seriously,  they have been running around without masks! And most are antiscience- so why would they think a vaccine will work?
180	107183	Why are all the politicians getting the vaccine when they didn’t do shit for us for most of the pandemic? Give it to the real heroes, healthcare workers, first. Not to mention giving it to the people who downplayed it 🤦🏻‍♂️
181	105340	Hope #vaccine and antidote to the #WuhanCoronavirus could be invented ASAP🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻   #WuhanCoronavirusOutbreak #Wuhan #coronavirus #WuhanJiayou #China #SARS #PrayforWuhan #StandwithWuhan
182	105460	This is good news.I assume they aren't allowed to carry the vaccine on the staircase or in the Long Room though.
183	106842	just a reminder that horseshoe crab blood is used in the Covid-19 vaccine, please try you’re best to help protect these beautiful creatures. if they weren’t as important to u before like they were to me they should be now 🦀
184	106883	@Lopez4VA Giving vaccines to everybody is the only way we are going to get past #COVID19.Those who complain about immigrants forget how much our economy depends on the work they do to make America function &amp; survive. They need to be healthy and taken care of just like the rest of U.S.
185	105891	Official petition to make masks a thing after covid too.I really like how it hides my ugly face.#coronavirus #CoronaVaccine
186	107343	When our Immune System is 99.95% effective, according to the CDC, why in the world would anyone take a vaccine that changes their DNA, not to mention the fetuses used to culture them...#AbortionIsMurder #COVIDIOTS #Covid1984
187	106117	Is it weird to feel that the basics like having a job and paying the bills don't feel as peak adulting as going to get my COVID-19 vaccine alone...I've always had Mama in every single one of my doctor's appointments. GP, OB, psychiatrist, therapist - you name it, she's there.
188	105931	So they have bypassed years of tests for the #COVID19Vaccine and to top it all off the virus is mutating. You cannot make a vaccine for something that then changes. The vaccine is then not only unsafe but useless.
189	106704	THE European Union is on the brink of coronavirus chaos as an Irish politician has called for the vaccine task force to be mandated to give unused AstraZeneca vaccines in France and Germany to IrelandHAVE A NICE DAY
190	106317	Tweets slating people refusing the potential COVID19 vaccine. I myself, will carry out my own research and remain objective at all time, it’s my body and my life. Therefore, my choice If I want this vaccine. There’s so much about vaccines people don’t know. Educate yourselves pls
191	201786	Here’s the gear I have to wear in my medical office in order to safely see patients. I’m about to get my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, and am so eager for EVERYBODY who wants vaccination against #COVID19 to get it. #COVIDVaccination @CBSThisMorning @CBSEveningNews @CBSNews https://t.co/trYSJ88dcq
192	201690	Good afternoon all my twitter people what a week covid-19 is just not giving up i had my Flu jab and came out with a bloody cold now. I have deleted about 8 fake accounts and my hospital appt got cancelled. I will follow back all genuine people. Now please Arsenal 3 points today.
193	107462	@janetlcardin @CBSNews There are seven known coronavirus that can infect humans. Four common ones,  plus MERS, SARS, and now COVID19.  We have exactly ZERO vaccines for the first six despite years of trying to make one.  What makes you think we will make one for covid19? You gonna live like this 4ever?

196	106159	What is the scientific research saying about this? And why don't they tell us about those who recovered without vaccine? 🤔
197	201595	my credit card debt is a direct result of the vaccine. i developed an urge to buy lots of clothes. it’s the vaccine’s fault and definitely not my own doing.
198	105877	@laurenboebert He’s probably got investments in the pharmaceutical company that is making the coronavirus vaccine. Now wants America to purchase enough for the world. But that stock just went way up
199	106315	Being from Bihar I think the politicisation of vaccine is Nonsense!!- Every Indian life matters- Free Covid vaccine must be given to every unprivileged citizen- If you give us Vote,we give it to you free. If not, then What?- Is Covid vaccine a commodity?#BiharElections2020
200	106304	@P_McCulloughMD After all there are 30 smthing different coronaviruses and flus that we fight w our developed adaptive immunity- Does covid vaccine replace adaptive response for all coronavirus / seasonal flu  infections we encounter going forward or do we get tht back at some point?
201	106540	@miramotamv @NPR I don't think you'll see the first one of any coronavirus vaccine until sometime late next year 2021. When they show trials, they give people hope that it will be soon but that's just not the case. They need a lot of testing, and then comes production and dissemination.
202	105495	@theRCN @HelenDon_RCN @buttynot @gallagher_rose @CNWLNHS Easy to get people to take the Flu jab this winter. Much more difficult to get them to take the Covid-19 vaccine next spring. To promote that poorly tested vaccine would be unethical, immoral and only legal because World Governments will change their laws to accommodate it.
203	105755	@RunJumpStefReid How would the vaccine be performance enhancing, compared with someone that is COVID-19 free?
204	107420	Gonna have to put my ass to sleep before they try and give me a vaccine ain’t no way I’m getting that.
205	106469	@realDonaldTrump you keep saying you're immune from COVID-19 since you have already had it. Why would you then need a vaccine? Either you're lying (you are) or you're stupid (this is true too)
206	105511	@_Mic_hael_ @JTyler36213241 @MMAFighting The research currently suggests that the antibodies will only last a couple of months. We don’t develop long term immunity to any coronavirus - this is why the flu vaccine is needed every year and we always gets cold - we don’t develop immunity.
207	106853	@MediaSequitur They certainly do not have our best intentions in mind. It is also illogical to make a vaccine against a zoonotic virus, one that T cell mediated memory immunity confers a strong response to across the Coronavirus family. SARS patients from 2003 have immunity to COVID19. This is
208	106482	I did post this on an anti vaccines thread as well as just posting it generally. Doesn’t seem like vaccine hesitancy is the big issue even if it is a small sample size
209	107424	Don't think I would. I was always against the flu vaccines but the corona vaccine would be no different. Don't trust 'em. They are 10x's more dangerous than a virus, in my opinion.
210	106921	How  do u know if   vaccines are effective?How can any1  predict if a person  can  get  infected or  not  in  the future ?BTW,  Covid RT PCR test kits  are  fraudulent and  they  were  made  way  back  in  2017  when Covid19 wasnt even  discovered
211	106004	@BuddyWinston Better yet, if the COVID-19 vaccine were called Super Soldier Serum that could make one powerful enough to beat up liberals, the Covidiots would take it. 🙂

213	105712	@squonkfart @LibertyNow11 @RealMattCouch @sutherland4thr U do realize they have been working on improving gain function for coronavirus in order to create vaccines? Our own government funds this research. My theory focused on people like Fauci &amp; Gates financially benefiting from this plandemic. They’ve got the world scared of the cold.
214	107585	@MaryLTrump Considering what a hoax the coronavirus is according to the GOP, it's unconscionable that they're lining up for the vaccine!
215	105727	@DailyCaller Surely no one should take this #COVID19 #vaccine. They will still have you in lock down and it will not even end the virus.
216	105790	Joseph R. Biden is calling for a total and complete shutdown of [J&amp;J vaccine] entering [our bodies] until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on [/figure out how to overcome the precautionary principle in simple cost-benefit analysis].
217	106139	There’s still a lot of testing to be done, but it’s some interesting stuff.  I got my flu vaccine because 1. I always do, and 2. if I actually got the flu anytime soon, I would be losing my shit until I was able to get a Covid test.
218	106496	@marketman52 @donnahot4Gaz Just curious... Did you get tested for Covid-19 or take the vaccine yet ??
219	105231	@LorimerPam I might be in the minority here, but I’m quite happy for my daughter to go back to school on 1st June. Coronavirus is here to stay. The risk level will be the same in September, and there’s no way a vaccine will be ready by then!
220	106045	My county is one of the red ones. All my neighbors now have COVID. They say they feel “fine” and so none of the ones not sick yet won’t get vaccinated. They keep trying to drop by my house sick bc they feel “fine”. I won’t open the door. I’m the only one vaxxed on my block. Ugh.
221	201646	@libshipwreck (nods)I imagine the implied assumption here is that the Covid-19 vaccine is Just Like The Flu.As in: You got to take your flu shot every year, so why not take this vaccine? After all, the Covid-19 vaccine is...Just Like the one for The Flu.😒😷
222	105578	"Did you notice the Ukraine health minster resigned because of, wait for it, a bungled vaccine rollout...? Linda Reynolds would certainly think Ukraine has too much ""natural empathy."" Meanwhile, the Liberal party has negative empathy, no accountability and zero competence."
223	106260	@sa_vvy_ What is this? Please stop! Get the covid-19 vaccine. We're in a time lapse in history; the polio or hepatitis B vaccines were developed in a time like this, &amp; now, every child has to take one. They aren't considered mark of the beast. Get the vaccine when you get a chance to, pls
224	201628	Let's do this guys and my Jelena2.0 fans let's do it for my girl Selena Gomez let's all end the pandemic once and for all and take the covid-19 vaccine so everyone can have their normal life back
225	105593	@rbrookbanks I still don’t understand why anyone thinks a vaccine is going to work against a coronavirus that mainly kills people aged 80+. Treatments will be the long term solution, not vaccines.
226	105807	@ConfusedTim @ansumDave @Quiggling @jonlansdell @Telegraph If. There is no guarantee nor has there ever been a vaccine for any of the 4 circulating coronavirus currently circulating.I hope it proves right but I have massive fear that it won’t be.
227	107166	My neighbors had people over again. They do it once, twice a week.I forgot to mention they live in the future, where there’s a vaccine for the coronavirus.
228	107255	If we don't get real about how dangerous Covid is, we will never get ahead of it. Viruses mutate. Constantly. Continuing research on vaccines &amp; continued mandatory masking protocols are going to be needed.
229	107036	@realDonaldTrump Is it 105b worth of coronavirus vaccine? Cuz that's what's preventing kids going to school. Republicans are holding us up on reducing cases, since they're hurt by a piece of cloth on their face.
230	106976	@Hricho151 @ThomasEvans1984 @alexblackmore67 I didn't say we wouldn't get hit again, as long as you maintain certain rules it will be manageable, masks, distancing, cleaning hands and so on.Herd immunity will save more in the long run because immune people can not be carriers and no Coronavirus vaccine has ever been made.
231	106254	There is a vaccine for the flu, but there are alot strains of flu. One vaccine doesnt cover them all.People still get the flu every year.If a Covid-19 vaccine is created, how long will it be good for? Will there be multiple strains a vaccine doesnt cover?
232	105405	@Zaggs @VerumVulnero1 If they all had taken the COVID-19 vaccine then we could just track them will Bill Gates’ microchip!Dotard!
233	107617	There were poor arguments for private companies requiring vaccines. There is no argument for government organizations to require it. I’m out of this hellhole state once my apartment lease ends. The South won the war.

235	106044	Religious and ideological extremism has no place in an ethical debate about #SARSCoV2 #COVID19 #coronavirus vaccine development. If you truly value human life, then don't stand in the way of a lifesaving vaccine, especially by justifying it with convoluted ethical equivalencies.

247	107224	I don’t get it. If your immune system fights it off at 98-99% what’s the need for a vaccine that has a lower rate ? I’ll wait. . . The same way abortions are considered a my choice my body deal I think these vaccines should be too. #mychoicemybody

265	106954	there is a flu vaccine yet for 35 years I have had to watch out for the flu. I cant have a flu shot and I would assume that I also wont be able to have a Covid-19 shot. So unless you're going to mandate everyone healthy gets the vaccine it will change 0 for me.
266	105436	I wonder how this is going to get resolved. It's hard to imagine a scenario where 70 - 85% of Americans voluntarily get the vaccine.In this age of contrarianism, it's hard to imagine any matter where 70 - 85% of Americans would agree on the resolution.

268	106057	America now has the most % people with #COVID19 antibodies. USA Number ONE!Sadly, it means nothing for herd immunity. Studies already showed antibodies don't last very long. You can get sick again. Herd immunity is a myth without an effective vaccine.#TrumpCOVID19 lies.
269	105729	Why in the hell are we doing COVID vaccine trials on kids!?They are such low risk that this makes zero sense.We know the risk is exceedingly low if kids get COVID and the risk is unknown with the vaccine so we think it makes sense to give them the vaccine!?
270	105692	Immunocompromised immune system may not survive after vaccine because it contains mimic of corona virus, they use corona virus DNA to make mRNA Covid19 vaccine to trigger your immune system to produce antibodies against this virus.

278	106860	So people should rather sit next to someone with a vaccine card who can still spread the virus, instead of sitting next to someone who has a negative test result and can’t spread the virus because they don’t have it? What a strange world we live in.
279	105684	@Cyndula @TheJordanRachel Yes it is when the vaccinated are getting Covid-19 again. There are probably multiple strains already around. Hence the new variant. Passing through that many people. This is why we have a new flu shot every year. The vaccines can control it. But we shouldn't have to get it
280	106515	??? The vaccine doesn’t prevent you from getting covid. I hope he doesn’t think it does. I hope no one thinks that.
281	107018	@WeWanttoLive5 @AlexBerenson In theory that's great if you have a vaccine or 90-95% have had it and are immune not enough is know about coronavirus to say anybody is immune people are getting twice
282	105808	@TheHugoMorales The WHO said a couple days ago that it will likely be around forever. This vaccine will end up being another flu shot. Idk why people are waiting for a vaccine to a coronavirus anyway.

363	105235	Would you rather get COVID-19 or have a vaccine shot for COVID-19? #COVID19  #coronavirus #ChinaVirus #vaccine #COVID19Vaccine
364	106529	Please take the first vaccine available to you. Please do not socialize indoors. Please stay home if you are privileged enough to do so. Please mask and distance. Every individual, acting now, for the love of their community, can stop this from happening.
365	107266	I knew this would happen.Corruption is rampant.Tell me again how I need to rush out among a crowd of anti maskers &amp; expose myself to this virus, just so I can get a vaccine that has been deliberately ruined for political reasons.
366	106781	Once every adult who wants the COVID-19 vaccine has had an opportunity to get it, the restrictions should all be lifted. Right?
367	107059	"If the coronavirus is so bad, such a threat, then how did my 77-yr old, bed ridden mother who has COPD &amp; is on oxygen 24 hours a day just survive it? She hasn't had &amp; will not have a ""vaccine"". @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow @TuckerCarlson @dbongino @WatchChad"
368	105482	Here we go, #HumanRightsViolations  against our #Military once again.  We’ve seen this before, but never with a dna altering #vaccine.  This is: #Transhumanism #CrimeAgainstHumanity We demand #InformedConsent!#NoVaccine #WakeUpAmerica
369	106449	The vaccine does not stop you from getting the virus!!! It protects you from getting a severe form of the disease. How is this so difficult to understand?
370	105599	Twitter locked my account and made me remove my tweet for saying that I have c*vid rn and my baby is completely unaffected - even according to my doctor my baby is/will be fine. And I am fine. Injecting an experimental vaccine esp. while you are pregnant is disturbing.
371	106141	@alina_garner @gitoma1 @sajidjavid @IndependentSage @CMO_England I dont see why it wouldn't become endemic, though if it drifts enough like the flu virus (unlikely), it may require yearly vaccine as it may effect those at higher risk endemic perhaps, but how long? Years, decades, no one knows I dont think coronavirus studies/cont..
372	105302	@WufpakRed @AndyCasarolle @RyanGirdusky He’s taking about the coronavirus vaccine mandate !! my goodness how dense can you be?
373	106836	🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽#COVID19 is real people The reason why don’t go out much in NYC anymore if I dont need to. A #PANDEMIC is here so why would people not following rules of social distancing and wear PPE’s &amp; still socialize/party/march for justice. Be #WISE Life over party- #vaccine soon!
374	106530	Yeap, They do not care, and just allowing Covid-19 to spread.☠️😭🇺🇸💙 President keeps pumping a miracle vaccine will be here, any moment( BS)!  It does make you wonder, “Why”?
375	106649	Great to see the bleeding heart NHS-loving celebs on #JeremyVine advocating queue jumping for the Coronavirus vaccine if you've got the cash.
376	107093	You go out on a thrive and all your brasse recieved their Covid-19 vaccines, you chose not to. Fast forward, everyone catches covid yet they don’t get seriously ill. You on other hand are hooked up to a ventilator coz you chose to ignore the science.

Never have we had such a tyranny. Where will the evidence be that it will work? We have the flu vaccine but still have flu. The common cold, a coronavirus, can't pretend to a vaccine. Will there be one for C19 because it was man-made in the first place?
378	106035	The COVID-19 vaccine should tested on @OfficialPDPNig members first . If they survive the vaccine is safe , if they don't NIGERIA  is safe.  Thank you all .
379	105583	This is fundamentally the outcome of the commentariat deciding to disparage foreign vaccine programmes when it looked as if they may beat Britain too it. Once you begin undermining reality the genie can’t be put back in the box
380	107147	@rogertansey As harsh as this might sound.. triage is needed. If the older people come in with covid19 that chose not to take the vaccine don't treat them. Treat only the children that were not taken care of. They are the future. Can't fix stupid. They get to own it. They chose it.
381	107131	@KatalinTischha1 @alfgrowler @MorphingReality @richard_xxxx @ClarkeMicah We have been studying the aids virus for 30 years. We still cannot formulate a vaccine. This coronavirus has been around 6 months. We are in the foothills of discovery on the long term effects. If sustained exposure causes serious long term damage we will not know for months/yrs.
382	107492	@CNBCnow I'm curious as to if this drug works like a flu vaccine where if someone who has the coronavirus take this drug not only gets better, but also developed antibodies to the disease
383	106544	they should have mandated vaccines from day 1, in NY we’re mandated to be vaccinated in order to attend school, why can’t they just add the covid-19 vaccine to that list, the honor system was never going to work lmfao
384	106160	y’all it’s so awesome to be able to answer “my colleagues are actually working on this!” to so many vaccine questions 🙌
385	107666	#coronavirus every religion says we are children of God then can any vaccines or negative news or being a loner living in fear can improve your immune when God has given us sun moon stars wind laughter everything to improve our immune naturally..think @duttsanjay @karanjohar
386	106261	Please be aware of this.The #COVID19 #vaccine is not like any other vaccine you have ever had.It is not something that can be called a vaccine if you check the contents.Please don't get hurt anymore.Do your own research.
387	106960	@BorisJohnson @bbcburnsy @looknorthBBC @peter_levy you say all the top 4 priority groups have all had the first covid Jab. This is not correct. I and my sister are in priority 4 and not even had a letter, text, or phone call to get one. #COVID19 #vaccine #VaccinePassports
388	107055	The only way Trump makes these coronavirus press conferences a positive is if he blows up Fauci and Birx for the frauds that they are. Bring in 100 doctors and have a true discussion about the virus. And forget about your vaccine. Otherwise, we’re back to where we started.
389	201598	@gillianlant @9NewsMelb Awesome seeing the first person to get their 3rd jab. Good on Roman &amp; I wish one of the members of VIctorian government witness that, like Scott Morrison did with the first ever Covid19 vaccine recipient.
390	105834	@PlatinumJab Sir, u said bharat and china will work together in the future. Is the coronavirus outbreak a step towards it?
391	106665	@LotusOak2 What are your thoughts on the Covid19 vaccine altering our DNA? Do you have any information on this please? Obviously when you google this every article claims this to be false but I still have my doubts
392	105444	@aslavitt46 @ASlavitt Dr. Slavitt, Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. You don’t know the science on this I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
393	107114	This is my first tweet about China. peoples are getting worst like Chinese people we humans have some rules for eating habits this creatures(Chinese people) will not leave any thing like dogs, batsetc., my conclusion is do something to China or please discover vaccine for covid19
394	201801	"This is concerning. ""The congressman had received a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and had tested negative for Covid-19 before attending President Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20, Tarpey said. But she did not specify when Lynch received each dose of the vaccine."""

396	106818	@Henrik_Palmgren I wonder if Ms Wu has heard of antibody dependent enhancement, the downfall of previous coronavirus vaccine attempts (SARS/MERS)? Having a more severe immune reaction on 2nd exposure isn’t necessarily the herald of a successful vaccine.

400	106104	The irony that a vaccine trial can be completed more quickly in the United States, because the pandemic is out of control in this country.  Scientists can get vaccine testing data rapidly.
401	107594	$GRTS We can’t keep getting booster shots every few months when a new variant appears. Outdated thinking and is akin to pulling up to a gas pump in a Tesla. Gritstone solves this.
402	107625	"""Russia has developed 'first' coronavirus vaccine: Putin""-With the added advantage that you can do 100 meters in 9.5 seconds!"
403	107539	h*******t. We’ve got vaccinated nursing home residents who are turning up positive for coronavirus. Vaccines and masks do not work. I repeat they are not effective.
404	107248	@AudreyManaster2 This is how the new vaccine will be produced, I think with changes in the coronavirus DNA genomes and why in some trials now they've been halted due to test human subjects having serious reactions. Why a rushed vaccine could have devastating effects. My assumption from readings.
405	106604	@ashtrei2 @GatesAnti So you wanna Die? If you want to die you don't need to make other people think #antivax is good. Just get tested on Covid-19 and get your Vaccine.It's that simple!
406	105847	"The easy part for them is that most Americans will line up the first day the vaccine is available.  The hard part will be getting the rest to doing them.  ""Persuading"" us won't work, and they know it.  And that's the hidden truth behind this story.  They know we'll fight it."
407	106202	If you’re in Kentucky or Indiana and need help signing up for a vaccine, feel free to reach out to me. I’ve had plenty of luck finding appointments for several family members and friends.

411	106245	@MattHancock @Peston @lfspinney @BBCJustinR why is no one talking about the inhaled interferon #SNG001 as the solution for #COVID19 this winter. We need effective treatments and a small British biotech has the answer. We need to protect ourselves THIS WINTER &amp; a vaccine isn't going to do that
412	105654	Not sure when/if I am getting my flu jab this year. Usually eligible due to asthma. Nothing on my GP website and NHS Scot only taking bookings for health care workers (using same portal as COVID-19 vaccinations). It’s important I get it so I can look after my baby properly.
413	106708	@AndrewMarr9 why is it taking so long to get the Novavax Covid19 vaccine approved, this excellent vaccine could ensure ample vaccines are available. The government has pre-ordered this vaccine, what’s the hold up? Ps I’m on the Novavax trial!
414	106516	They say that as if we aren’t used as pawns to reel our people in. 3-4 of their COVID-19 vaccine test subjects have already been diagnosed with Bell’s Palsy. It’s a no for me. Idc if every black person in the entire world took this vaccine, I would be the only one who didn’t.
415	105644	If it's true then it will be great victory for humanity against Coronavirus #vaccine #coronavirus #CoronaUpdates
416	107161	Okay, someone educate me now because what I just typed out makes sense to me, so I'm trying to figure out if the amount of push to get the vaccine has legitimate backing, or if it's going to be a short-term fix to COVID19 but the cause of something else that cripples us.
417	107286	gonna be disappointed if the coronavirus vaccine doesn't give me the huge butt and tits that the boomers say it does
418	106146	@JoeBiden all this stuff your doing isn’t getting the Coronavirus vaccines IN AMERICANS ARMS - who’s running this operation?
419	106846	@HeidiForLiberty @realDonaldTrump After only 45 years, the flu vaccine is administered annually. Many catch the flu anyway. So given both are Coronavirus’, why do we believe a vaccine will return us to normal. Listen to fauci, he is already questionin how many does are needed and the durability of the immunity.

423	107321	@NetflixIndia America reaction to Russia claiming that they have made the first vaccine for the Coronavirus Covid-19
424	105450	Vaccines seem to be failing pretty bad. Long as the virus is around it will mutate. Need therapeutics for a return to normal @ImmunoPrecise $ipa
425	105923	Covid-19 vaccine has the ability to change your DNA. Be careful don't take it. Besides covid-19 has very low mortality rate. You can survive without any medication.
426	106721	Whoop there it is. #TheWhitehouse will determine the efficacy of the #coronavirus Vaccine according to Brian Morgantsen Deputy Whitehouse Press Secretary. If it's not @FDA fuhgetaboutit, no American is taking this Vaccine.
427	105704	@tedcruz Same way it makes sense that COVID-19 denialists like Marco Rubio get a vaccine first.Gitmo has guards.  They would not want COVID-19 to spread as it has in other prisons.
428	107532	This could be like letting a stranger drive you across the country, if that stranger got a driver's license 40 years ago but never drove a car after passing the exam.It's because people won't get vaxxed and take precautions during a global pandemic. Incredible.
429	201575	"It baffles me every time I hear my peers say ""I don't know what's in the vaccine so I'm not taking it"" My reply-- We've taken well over 7 vaccines since birth without knowing the composition, Covid-19 vaccine isn't any different. Get vaccinated joor!!"
430	107337	This is why we always remind that Covid-19 is not a joke. For those who loves to go out and dating here and there please wake up. Vaccines or not you will still have the chance to be infected
431	201639	Got my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine this week, some friends did some pretty awesome things, excited about #MenInKilts, &amp; bought myself some chocolate covered 🍓 &amp; pasta to treat myself today. Time to spread some love &amp; save some lives by donating plasma. #ValentinesDay ❤
432	105372	@USATODAY Viruses mutate.  That is why they have to tweak the flu vaccine every year.  That is why there is no vaccine for the common cold.  The #coronavirus is a cousin to these.  The Pfizer CEO may know this, that is why he sold Pfizer stock when their vaccine was announced.
433	106977	THAT is terrific since a vaccine will be useless against what is tantamount to a common cold. The Flu shot is just as useless (it made my husband sick for 6 months).  Save our tax dollars.!.!
434	106709	#COVID19 #BillGates// I hope you struggle until you're HOMELESS because you deserve it for being so damn DUMB. Even comedian George Carlin would be able to see through this shit but you all probably wouldn't believe him either. All of you all who will take the vaccine, when it
435	105722	@NTVNewsNL @KellyAnneNTV Yeah I think I will sit this one out for while... You know.. to see what happens to the people who do take a rushed vaccine for a coronavirus where they cut safety and testing measures at every corner...
436	107090	This is such a stretch but tomorrow, we're gonna see a landslide in covid19 cases.... #Chromatica is the vaccine!!!!!!
437	106490	And what's abt gujarat ?? They are ruling since 25 years still no announcement of free vaccine. Inspite other states has already announced free vaccine like UP, MP, Jharkhand etc etc. @BJP4Gujarat @BJP4India @CMOGuj @vijayrupanibjp
438	106150	Devastating news for the doomers who want to stay inside till a vaccine is made. Looks like ya’ll might have to just put your immune systems to work like nature intended 😅 #VaccinesWork

441	107076	@johnb3112 @PaulBuc31614268 @Pfizer_UK Err, you can get flu after being vaccinated. So no, covid isn't the only one. You need a course on epidemiology as you obviously don't understand. Or even to read up on the basics of vaccines for coronavirus'. 😂😂
442	106832	This is very important.  It looks like we should be deploying vaccines around the world rather than boosting, for many good reasons
443	106263	Free testing for the Coronavirus. At my job. Hell no I will never trust a system That find it OK to shoot me but then want to save me with a vaccine. Something is not right here if you can’t protect me legally through bullets and guns are you going to save me with a vaccine
444	106475	My covid-19 vaccine is booked. I’ve been eligible since March, but I’ve had some trouble getting an appointment. I don’t have the words for the gratitude I feel today. Hang in there everyone, better times are coming. 💛
445	106702	When it comes to taking that vaccine, I'm in no rush to get it. I have to give it time.The vaccine is not a cure to covid19. There are medication out there which can cure the covid and they are been overlooked. Why is it so?There is something fishy about this vaccine.
446	106239	So basically we don't have vaccine for virus which is killed by hand sanitizer....Ironic isn't it 😂😂,@COVIDNewsByMIB #COVID__19 #coronavirus
447	107306	This is a two America’s moment. I would never do any of the things in this video but I’ll take the vaccine tho
448	106318	Is it too late to join the vaccine race? How far are we into this bubble. Is there still money to be made or is it nearly done? Asking for a friend...
449	106267	We had the same evaluation in Canada a month or so ago. Canada, I believe, now has 5 vaccines approved, all with 100% efficacy against hospitalization, meaning it reduces the severity of the infection if you do get infected. In 79%, it prevents symptoms completely. Great news.
450	105374	@CDCgov @FatEmperor I don’t remember getting this advice before I had the flu vaccine. Is it perhaps because the COVID-19 vaccines have been hurried through a typical approval process and they don’t have enough data yet on how effective they truly are.
451	106759	If some of the countries are out hacking into other countries data to steal a covid19 vaccine, that would mean the stealer does not have a vaccine and if they claim they do, it mustn't work
452	106198	Notice they specify the words ‘fully vaxed’ so when they are talking about ‘unvaxed’ they are also referring to those who may have only had one shot or failed to get a booster. Hence ‘unvaxed’ is a large pool...
453	201761	My body my choice &amp;  my choice is no.  It's an unproven, untested vaccine no matter who made it and I'll be goddamned if it's going into my body. You want it go ahead, your body your choice.
454	106886	Just don’t take one.  Why take a vaccine for a virus that has a .03% death rate and that will only make Bill Gates richer.  THINK PEEPS!
455	107350	@cosmicdust911 @CatherineLugg @ASlavitt The reason we don’t have a vaccine for colds is because there are so many strains of cold viruses. We do have vaccines against certain coronaviruses already. This is one strain of coronavirus which makes a single vaccine much easier.
456	107425	I took my headache vaccine this morning.Yesterday I had some allergy vaccine.My wife took her baby vaccine. We’re destroying language. This isn’t a vaccine. #COVID19 #vaccine #Biden @ComicDaveSmith @michaelmalice
457	201794	@LeoRautins caught your speech with @Paul__Jones and @Eric__Smith on the @FAN590 in my car today and I was applauding you. I had my vaccine on Friday so I am thankful I won’t have to part with my OHIP card #dotherightthing #GetTheShot #covid19
458	105334	So, just to get this straight:a) international cooperation;b) immigrants, and not just one gender;c) working in a country with free univ tuition= the first COVID vaccine to save lives. #cdnpse
459	106431	This article is poorly written. There was absolutely no reason to say that they’re the poorest nation (as if that’s their fault???) and if you’re writing an article on how there’s no vaccines then focus on that. Why are you mentioning the other struggles of the country?
460	201756	I talked to my parents on the phone today. My mom was worried that if there will be a vaccine for COVID-19 then I should not get it because I’ll die or get a “micro chip” under my skin. Also, my mom refuses to wear a mask because it damages the respiratory system.
461	107196	"@Louise86958858 @KorbelRenoKia @stacyhrae Covid vaccine started being developed after the SARS epidemic (also a firm of Coronavirus) . That's why it seemed ""fast"". They had all the groundwork done over the last 15 years."

463	201638	This morning after 7 AM got the vaccine, it’s 9:21 PM now and I feel like shit, I had a fairly high temperature and everything hurts. But I'll be fine! 🥴#IGotVaccined #Vaccined #COVID19Vaccine #COVID19 #JohnsonAndJohnson #Poland https://t.co/zZZ5hI8w1J
464	105505	@tigheklory @stgenerations There are thousands of flu strains, they try to predict a few of out that and end up with 40% or higher success. Not too bad, but CoVid19 is a mutation of the SARS-CoV virus. Very different from the flu virus. The work on this vaccine started with work on SARS-Cov.
465	107467	@FionaMattatall I actually believe this faith in vaccines is a bit dangerous. Yes, they are important and yes, they will help us get back to some sort of normal life, but they won't eradicate Covid-19 completely and we'll still need to be careful.
466	106760	2 residents died in my mom's LTC home in the past week. Because workers allowed to choose not to get vaccine- 2 floors on lockdown, no activities, all isolated to rooms. Visits outside over. No way to live  @celliottability @drkieranmoore @fordnation @epdevilla @CBCNews

472	106514	Yeah, and that's why they (i.e. not US, but THEM) are having such a hard time replicating an effective vaccine? --These hominid scientists must be socially incentivized to make highly illogical statements, or are otherwise not properly thinking through the planetwide phenomena.
473	107149	Why the hell would anyone with common sense buy vaccines from Gates? He’s on trial for horrible crimes against the poor in multiple countries
474	106689	👉This quick survey is for people working in care homes or social care.Researchers want to know the number of staff getting their flu jabs, which is already thought to be low.Knowing this (and why) could help more staff get their vaccines and reduce pressure from #COVID19.

476	107330	I will continue to repeat this: Covid deniers should not be vaccinated until everyone else has received the vaccine, especially hypocrites like Rubio.
477	106276	I demand a coronavirus vaccine so we can get to the bottom of why @nbc has not made Bye Bye Birdie live with @JLo happen after 4 years.
478	106700	“What would I do if offered the AZ vaccine? I can't speak for other people, and obviously risk and benefit is something we all have to think about for ourselves, but as a hospital worker in Australia I'm scheduled to get the AZ vaccine some time in the next two months.”
479	107430	Since you can still get covid and spread it, shouldn't the vaxxed get tested too? #NoVaccineMandates #MyBodyMyChoice
480	106041	@mickschimp @GovPritzker Vaccines are particularly helpful for herd immunity but they take years to develop. Because COVID-19 is so new there is no herd immunity, because there is no immunity. Being exposed to the virus can be deadly so therefore it is best not to risk it. Period.
481	105406	@jenrinehart5 To protect our aged mom's health, my brother and I signed up for the Moderna coronavirus vaccine.
482	105339	@DaniellaCarlisi I get flu shot every year—no problems.  Am hesitant to get COVID-19 shot when it becomes available because it sounds as though Trump is rushing it to market without proper testing.  Wish there were a way to get a Canadian vaccine.  Would drive to border if available to us.

488	106483	There are many people out there can't take the COVID19 VACCINE because of their present health conditions....if they get the COVID19 VIRUS chances are they may not survive.
489	106259	@RealCandaceO I’m confused. If the right person/group created a vaccine, you wouldn’t take it if Covid-19 kept coming back? Do you get your flu shot? Havent you been critical of anti-vaxers before this? I’m generally curious no disrespect
490	201754	"Saying ""God will blow in my lungs again"" is just arrogant. A reasonable person of faith would thank the Almighty for the assist, then get the vaccine. #COVID19 #COVIDIOTS"
491	106725	Yes Selena Gomez is getting the covid-19 vaccine because she saw Britney Spears got it I'm going to keep an eye on her and make sure she is okay it won't even matter if she die because she will be still alive in my fantasies until I die
492	105558	this is extremely sad but people forget that vaccines protect you only about 95% from getting covid. you can still get covid. but it does give u 100% protection from it being deadly. doesn’t mean you won’t have painful symptoms. just to put it all in perspective.
493	105988	Can I get my follow-up vaccine in 8 months (or however long it’s gonna be) here plsI also pretended to swim on the floor underneath this while also dealing with a disgustingly swollen ankle/leg covered in rashes (possibly) caused by Lyme Disease in college #Nevur4get
494	105493	A shockingly high statistic, please RT, blood cancer patients need to know how effective the COVID vaccine is for them
495	107335	@hdevreij But hwo do they beat they the virus if not with particular antibodies ? @who .. the question is therefore  also vice versa .. People with no flu vaccine beat the flu too #COVID19  #coronavirus

497	106973	@KhamisuArt So let me explain it like this- with vaccines being preventatives, not cures. In other words, the vaccine will protect a person who receives it by lowering their chances of getting COVID-19 if they encounter the coronavirus.
498	107307	Fear not. Prolly we aint gonna have a choice about whether we get the coronavirus vaccine or not-because we are gonna hafta have an official government vaccine certificate on our phones to enter buildings, fly, shop, drive, have a bank account, buy anything, go out, have a job.
499	107589	If you think about it if your body can’t make antibodies against Covid-19 once you’ve had it like they say then how is the vaccine 90% effective ? Cos don’t vaccines work by ur body making antibodies to a weakened version of the virus for when you get it properly 🤔
500	105982	That coronavirus vaccine is definitely going to be a requirement for school districts and colleges/universities. I dont know why this is even a debate when they ALREADY mandate that students have certain shots/vaccines at enrollment.
501	105448	Still don’t understand why I need a vaccine that has lower efficacy than my own immune system. 99% vs. 94%. Vaccine does not prevent transmission, so what is the purpose?
502	105791	if the COVID-19 vaccine is available to you why wouldn’t you get it? please explain your reasoning i am really trying to understand
503	105211	should I get da coronavirus vaccine and spend my weekend feeling like pure shit or should I wait and possibly get the coof
504	107602	🇨🇦I wonder if a extra faster booster shot is needed after shot 2? All Governments seem to lag behind the science in my opinion. But, there is a problem with having enough for poor countries to even get shot 1. So, this is not good news. 👇

507	106234	@elzi0n engineering the body to produce coronavirus spike proteins like a Frankenstein mutation. To magically coerce anti-bodies when anti-bodies provided no such protection before, and will only reduce symptoms. based on faulty PCR. Is not a vaccine. It's fraud.
508	106345	Because most of y'all won't get the vaccine, #COVID19 is going to hang around like herpes. India WISH they had as much vaccine and open appointments as us.Listen, the vaccine isn't killing folks. #Covid_19 STILL is.
509	106214	need i remind you that coronavirus HAS been around and they’ve been developing a vaccine for years now. this is just a different strand, so no they didn’t pull a vaccine out of thin air in 6 months.
510	107570	I don’t understand either. It is a mystery. I am fully vaccinated with booster and so are my three young kids. I was so relieved when they were eligible to get the vaccine. Why wouldn’t I do something to help mitigate the risk of them getting sick? That’s how I see it…🤷‍♀️
511	107474	@Warnzwifey @SimonYstwyth @Louiseg37789012 @simondolan A successful vaccine is perhaps 70% effective, a poor one 30%.We’ve been trying for 40 years for a coronavirus vaccine &amp; failed, there is not one. How effective do you supposed the rushed, untested &amp; very expensive mandated one will be??If you think 50% you’re deluded.
512	107562	In 24 hours I will receive my first COVID19 vaccine and I am overwhelmingly relieved.Being immunocompromised and living through a pandemic has been a special kind of bad, but hopefully this is the beginning of the end🙌🏼
513	105897	It's crazy how sm people so willing to criticize people for not putting a vaccine in their body when the vaccine is still in emergency usage, is pushed by the Gov w a pedophile as the spokes person (bill gates) and it doesnt even fuckin work effectively? People still die
514	106676	@marco001100 @RedDogT3 LOL. Do you know from where the vaccinated people are getting COVID? Ding Ding Ding, they are getting it from unvaccinated people. If all unvaccinated get the vaccine, vaccinated won't get an infection because there is no unvaccinated to spread COVID19 to the vaccinated

520	106305	@Arethusa99 @CT_Bergstrom @loisbeckett @CNBC @WHO I'm afraid the genie that isn't going to go back in the bottle, after the protests, is the #COVID19 restrictions. There's not even any point in advocating restrictions now.  It will just invite resistance to doing things like wearing masks and taking vaccines.
521	105563	@rabid_rabitt @nathandfletcher @DPJHodges And when will they be ready because we were told they would be ready to roll out by October and that's tomorrow. No coronavirus vaccine currently exists, only 1 disease has ever been eradicated by vaccine and that took 184 years to achieve. There is no magic bullet coming.
522	107249	@guardian What happened to FLATTENING THE CURVE? You can’t eradicate a virus. Furthermore there has never been a vaccine for ANY coronavirus - Aka Flu, SARS, Mers-COV. I smell propaganda.
523	106100	@jsolomonReports @justonepatriot Fauci has a financial stake in a vaccine for coronavirus.  If a cheap alternative can knock this out Fauci would not only lose financially but he would lose his liberal rock star status and miss out on the opportunity to go on tv and and give his fase predictions.

526	106296	@kmelo32 How long does wearing a mask last? Coronavirus is one of the most common viruses there is. This virus will mutate at around nine month intervals drastically. Vaccines will be as useful as vaccines for the flu just a best guess. We all need to start thinking for ourselves
527	107399	@TosinAshafa It's really scary tbh but then all we can do is wait till a vaccine is out or we might possibly not have one, treatment would be the only curable option for Covid-19 in the long run
528	106314	@jasonsphipps I think they will be lifted when our hospitalizations are very low from COVID-19 (right now on par with influenza but understandably US probably wants even lower severe disease which can be accomplished with vaccines).

532	107398	Running implicitly thru the nytimes piece on the Oxford covid-19 vaccine work is the fact capital refuses to fund research or vaccine development to save millions of lives unless it sees profit in it. This fact is acknowledged in a buried paragraph but critical for understanding

541	105649	Am sure in the covid-19 researchers’ labs they are talking about finding someone that is immune to the virus in order to make the vaccine and it’s like some African guy in like central Africa
542	107015	Without adequate vaccine cover when SOPs are relaxed there will be an another wave, “V” shaped recovery is for countries that ensure adequate vaccine coverage. For countries like us it is “W” a shaped recovery.

550	106116	London doesn't know how many residents it has. People move in and out and don't always bother to update GPs. Probably accounts for London's comparatively low vaccine stats and infection stats. So they are sending out letters to -people who aren't here.

552	106638	@Reuters The single information guide is obviously wrong, and it will make you misunderstand. It is correct to understand the conditions for manufacturing coronavirus, and the vaccine used in China is an inactivated virus vaccine, not mRNA. There is no technical condition.🙏
553	107277	I don't see this playing out well for the @NFL and the @NFLPA They practically forced their players to get vaccinated so they could play this season and here we are with guys testing positive left and right. Wonder how players will feel about getting jabbed and still can't play
554	106489	We’re in 58th place in the world, Gerry, behind Borat’s Kazakhstan, for percentage fully vaccinated. That’s how I am measuring success. My mother being in the hospital for a month with Covid, but fortunately not dying, is a success but it had nothing to do with securing vaccines
555	105533	@KyleThinksTwice @BrennanGeis @Dean_Winnipeg @PierrePoilievre They work far better than no vaccine. Another 50 people died in Ontario today from #COVID19 and ICU admissions are up above 600. This is because most do not have a booster. If you want to get sick great, but don’t try to use your rights as a way to take my rights away.
556	105965	@DrTomFrieden How about Inate or crossimmunity. Like how cowpox cured smallpox and vaccinia is used in the smallpox vaccine. Three different strains of pox virus. So other coronavirus exposure could provide cross immunity to the covid one.
557	105880	Would be interesting to know what the usual vote is for vaccines. I think it is important to know what the concerns were for the no/abstains
558	201683	Now really debating to really call my dentist office sometimes this week before my second COVID-19 vaccine next week since my toothache is not getting any better and it is starting to really bother me. Now I am not going to be surprised if I do have a cavity and my sealants worn.

565	106342	@Polkameister I could see saying until COVID-19 has a vaccine loosening this as yes some will abuse it but we want to ensure anyone sick isn't coming to work to avoid spread, but making this permanent is nuts.  I think 5 sick days and anything beyond requires a doctor's note.
566	106743	@RichieRTR @conorsen Also, the reason why the flu vaccine is 46% effective is not really relevant here. Flu vx is partially a guesswork game about which new mutations will be prevalent in the coming year. That is not the case with covid-19 as it has very little evolutionary pressure.

593	107007	. In any event, there is growing evidence that having caught #Covid19 does not give strong immunity (like the common cold, another #coronavirus.It is thought that a vaccine based on a mutated, but different, virus will give much stronger immunity.
594	106459	comparing the covid vaccine to falcon punch is like saying the vaccine takes 2 weeks to become effective and a chance it will cause me to immediately die (the vaccine is incredibly punishable)
595	201800	Mom and dad are fully vaccinated and have waited the appropriate amount of time post shot which meant we finally got to see them!! I am not ashamed to admit to you that I pushed both dogs and children out of my way so I could get the first hug. #COVID19 #VaccinationCovid #vaccine https://t.co/KX91KZvZT5

597	201604	I finally got an appointment to get my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine!!! This is probably the only time in my life I’ll be excited to have a big and scary needle jabbed into me. https://t.co/XQH09z6xyf
598	106538	So far my pcp said its pk to get the #COVID19 vaccine but said first to talk to my neurologist about my treatment for my MG as that suppresses my immune system.
599	106468	If the doctors were all vaccinated, why do they care? Their vaccine will protect them 🤦🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️ #COVID #Covid19 #corona #Coronavirus #COVIDIOTS #COVID19Vic #CovidVaccine #covid
600	105920	@greenhousenyt @jwpetersNYT The million dollar question is Why do 328 million people need the vaccine when over 300 million people will not even know they even had Coronavirus and when they have had it the Bodies immune system will provide a Antibodies response against Coronavirus.
601	105696	coronavirus vaccine will come from Wonkas chocolate factory: you only get it if you get the golden ticket. there i said it
602	105296	@Peter_Mooney_ I am okay.I am releaved I get the 1st Covid19 Vaccine injection after a couple of weeks and second injection later.Burden of Truth in my heart! It was best drama show ever! Billy and Joanna in my heart! You are amazing and so talented! I love you! Take care!
603	201578	Turns out Covid-19 was an absolute piece of piss to find a vaccine for. Just wish someone had done it earlier...#AstraZeneca
604	106055	@FreckledLiberty There has never been an approved vaccine for any coronavirus...ever. They can’t pass trials. All you really need to know
605	105809	not to be political on main but i can’t wait for the controversy when conservatives refuse to get the coronavirus vaccine because it ~violates their rights~
606	107386	@Surgeon_General  Please watch and share this information with America. It is 100% legitimate and would end the pandemic. PLEASE don’t hold America hostage to the vaccine. If you care about Americans, you will help spread this information.

608	107014	@MittRomney Good point about S Korea and how THEY beat coronavirus and how WE didn'tTrump blaming Obama for not having a vaccine for a virus that didn't exist when he was President. Watching you gives me slim hope for your party - but sorry, I'll never vote Republican - ever.
609	201621	I received the Modern vaccine at work today. I was one of the first groups in our hospital to get the vaccine. We have next week to vacinate our entire staff and perhaps the following week. #CovidVaccine #ModernaVacccine #GetVaccinated #Moderna #WearAMask #COVID19 #StaySafe
610	105486	I don't understand why 6 out of 7 million would cause a pause. It's such a low %. Won't things like this lead to skepticism in a vaccine?
611	106956	The vaccine is free to all those in eligible groups. The NHS would never ask anyone for their bank details. They will be in touch when it is your turn to be vaccinated.
612	107582	How can they be recommending anything when there’s issues with these vaccines, i’m not anti-VAX I’m just anti-experimental VAX.  Get it right and then will think about taking it
613	106693	"Neil's right - it's about money. What he's forgetting is people NEED money to live and survive. Unless he's footing the bill to put millions out of work AGAIN. The ""lockdown dance"" isn't a good quality of life. We've found the way (vaccines) to do it safely. Don't stop it again"
614	107346	An amazing program in my network that is working to support training and career pathways for Black and Latin medical students toward HIV vaccine research!
615	105949	As a senior citizen I am so frustrated with FL in trying to get a covid-19 vaccine. I don't have a cell phone can't afford it-have a land line. Have a notebook, signed &amp; called my vaccine . com to get a place in line. No call back. I go on Publix site multiple times...
616	106182	m-m-m maybe just m-m-maybe if only they make access to vaccines equal for all, including third world countries... oh wait... they d-d-d don't...?
617	106240	@ChildrensHD @silvano_trotta Let us not forget that if the bidding for a hypothetical vaccine is so excessive, there will be no holds barred. We are witness to the worst human vileness. They will do everything to enlist the people in their project. They are more dangerous than Covid19.
618	107285	Why is everyone excited about a #covid19 vaccine? Don't you realize that in the US, the very rich will get it, the very poor will get it thru Medicaid, but if you fall in between these, it will be unavailable or so costly nobody can afford it? They're estimating $2000/shot
619	105940	@NYCGRIFF Get a grip!!! Lockdowns and vaccine mandates don't work! Vaccinated still getting Covid19 and omicron etc. They don't want to be vaccinated then they take the chance they may die. I am vaccinated and still got Covid19 so don't blame everything on Desantis!
620	105937	Which ever company researchers discovers the first successful Coronavirus vaccine deserves thr “Nobel peace price,” “The breakthrough prize” or any Science research award.
621	107067	@Jaz_Patriot @nathanmhansen #Boilingthefrog Powerful.It's just a mask.It's just communion or singing. You can still meet.It's just until we get a vaccine.It's just a few side effects.It's just a bracelet.It's just to let people know you're safe to be around.It's just for the coronavirus vaccine...
622	106032	@nic_davis4 @UKCovid19Stats This isn’t about any coronavirus with .1% mortality. Tories don’t spend money and world governments never agree. It isn’t any great reset either.Something is off if they are prepared to put out vaccines this fast using tech they’ve been hiding for a decade or more 🤔🤔🤔
623	105312	If hard core #GOP #GQP Crazies don’t like #COVID19 vaccine mandates, stop ALL vaccines. Just try some dirt or ivermectin, and other “home remedies” to stop polio, mumps, and other diseases. Is science REAL OR NOT? Just STAY OUT of hospitals when you get sick or are dying please!
624	106396	Please before testing the new vaccine in Africa, tell us the relationship between HIV and polio vaccine, and why vaccines have always to be forced to Africans while we know they are a test. This time round Africa does not need Covid 19 vaccine, malaria has been killing more.....
625	107551	@ccpastormike @GovMikeDeWine @LtGovHusted @OHdeptofhealth @DrAmyActon @realDonaldTrump And when they realize there will be no vaccine, they need to give up on that idea. There's never been a vaccine for any coronavirus.
626	107187	In Context, the Nurses May Not Be Taking a Vaccine Because They are Young with No Complicating Medical Issues &amp; Not High Risk. Some May have Already Had Covid. To All of the Non-Vaccinaters or Those that Just Don't Want to Take it, Thanks Because There is More for the Rest of Us.
627	106889	@BrittPettibone You may be right, however the election won't really matter if a coronavirus vaccine is forced on people before then.
628	105991	Can we all just agree that Donnie has gotten the COVID-19 vaccine long ago? There is no way in hell ppl that have been in contact with him every day are dropping like flies and he is still standing. #NotAConspiracyTheory
629	106572	@KMPHFOX26 Well we'll see about this I'm holding my breath we have not had any one in my immediate family catch the delta or the original covid-19 we're all vaccinated boostered up I'm just wondering if we're going to escape this time around too
630	107006	I got my first shot of covid-19 vaccine this morning. So far still good, there's nothing to be worry, except now I'm feeling sleepy &amp; hungry 😁
631	201698	I never got a flu vaccine until I realized how much safer it was for my grandparents, my father-in-law, and babies in my circle. Yes, I might only be a carrier, but they could have severe symptoms and even die. Covid is the same. Minnesotans look out for each other. #VaccinesWork
632	105661	If the PCR tests work-Why the false positives?If the masks work-Why the 6 feet?If 6 feet works-Why the masks?If all three work-Why the lockdowns?If all four work-Why the vaccine?If the vaccine is safe-Why the no liability clause?If Covid-19 exists- it not been isolated?
633	106488	@SurvivalGirl1 @NYCAIeks @NYGovCuomo Considering that I already stated  that the Coronavirus  strain is known as COVID-19, I am not suprised.When they formulate this vaccine  it will save myriad lives  because people's bodies will be able to develop antibodies as a prophylactic measure to make them resistant.  😁👍
634	107075	@sunethagampodi Hope you clearly know that this is false as a doctor.Almost all the child deaths were in unfortunate kids with chronic illnesses who had low immunity anyway.On the other hand unlike MMR vaccine, COVID-19 vaccines don't prevent infections, it only has a minor mortality benefit.
635	201503	Got my second COVID-19 vaccine earlier today, outside of a faint headache and a dull pain in my shoulder I'm feeling pretty okay so far. Will have to wait two more days for any side effects to come out, just hoping it'll go as smooth as my first vaccination did. https://t.co/XFehNH97HZ
636	106607	@GOPLeader Trump didn’t take responsibility for the spread of COVID-19 so he doesn't now get to take credit for a vaccine.
637	106316	So medics in a snowstorm can administer the vaccine to stranded motorists so not to waste it but a Dr. can't 😡 RIDICULOUS!' #vaccine #coronavirus
638	107201	@Armandozim @ToddCoo72170990 @LinaHidalgoTX Well actually the other end is not working.... Why do you think cdc is no longer tracking breakthrough covid-19 cases they don't want you to know the truth vaccine are not working
639	106518	So I’ve been offered a job as a care assistant (my third dream job 🥲) but also they’ve said that they can’t promise me that I don’t lose that job in the future if I don’t get the vaccine. 😓 I totally understand that and thanked them for the offer. Goodbye my dream job. #COVID19
640	105913	So my girlfriend got her #COVID19 vaccine #ShotNo1 she's kinda felt #FluLike for a couple days. I just have a headache and my arm is sore lol
641	107179	Family being sick is always sad. This girl doesn't believe in vaccines but will take mother with kidney cancer to hospital to get chemo therapy? I doubt this family would be pleased to be taken to a hospital where doctors #DoNotComply and let anyone go up and down and do whatever
642	106848	Here’s a contrast. Yesterday, spoke with someone in Arizona “reluctant” to get her #COVID19 vaccine. Why? Conspiracy theories. Today, a friend in #India who desperately wants a vaccine for her son said they can’t get it. We don’t realize how privileged we are in the US. Shameful.
643	105840	JUST IN - U.S. Army: Soldiers who refuse to get a COVID-19 vaccine will be immediately discharged, Reuters reports.
644	105403	I signed up for initial vaccine testing (wasn't chosen), but this is a responsible position. #ncpol #NCSenateDebate #ncsen
645	107508	Aren’t republicans needing help to feed their families? Don’t they want to receive the vaccine? Aren’t they Americans? So sad they are divided.
646	106258	No way!. Research the vaccines. Amazing how bad it is. Why take it? I don't trust government information!
647	107549	Even finding a covid-19 vaccine won’t be enough to end the pandemicLimited supplies could create coronavirus haves and have-nots around the globe once a vaccine is manufactured
648	107501	This is really just a “fuck you” to the disabled and immune compromised ppl like myself…I have my vaccine, I have my booster and I’m abt to get another…but without a plan in place getting COVID-19 is fatal for me and for many others.
649	106997	For those wondering.....YES! I’m going to get the COVID-19 Vaccine whenever it’s my turn or time to do it. I WANT MY LIFE BACK!
650	105591	my dad is leading the research and development on a coronavirus vaccine and i just sat on a bong water wet spot on my computer chair and had a panic attack
651	106864	@PoliticsForAlI If @UKLabour oppose vaccine passports and they fail to get through parliament, and if they begin to actually oppose the Coronavirus legislation then I think many of us might even consider voting for them again, having ditched them years ago. @EssexPR?You reading, @Keir_Starmer?
652	106703	Trump's latest is to say every American will get coronavirus vaccine by April. Trump the scientist? Trump the drug manufacturer? We can't get enough paper towels or onion powder in our grocery stores! Flu vaccines run out every year even though the population no. is known.
653	106026	I want details-I have RA, I take methotrexate, and I’m still an ICU RN. But does this make sense without antibody testing, with unvaxxed coworkers, and so many places in the world without enough vaccines? Like I don’t even know what is fair or right.
654	107142	@crbarnes001 If someone's has had the so-called vaccine they will probably get a positive test result. But you will never really know the truth as to if she had a virus or not because post-mortem and coroners have been banned for anyone registered as a covid-19 death.
655	105571	So glad they accept the Docket App for the vaccine proof. Easy to use and has all the information needed
656	107672	@MinistryofTru16 @LibertyTre3 @TheFutureLover @McAuleyATL @kenklippenstein @EconCircus @KilldozerSZN Is the US not also producing the largest opioid crisis in history? Meanwhile the UK has provided key research for the coronavirus vaccine. Both are good systems, but to say the US is currently superior because of pure output isn’t something I agree with.
657	106453	What an idiot  this guy @prageru @DennisPrager . Where would we be in this country if horrible people like Prager had obstructed polio vaccine like they do #COVID ? Dead. Or crippled . That’s where
658	106161	"I listened, but I still can't actually believe what I heard..!The MINISTER FOR HEALTH says it's called ""COVID-19"" because there were 18 other coronaviruses before this one?And developing a vaccine will be difficult because they weren't successful with any of the previous 18?🙊"
659	106888	How is it possible that healthy people must be forced to isolate, not work, then not get paid cus they have come into contact with a likely vaccinated, testing, app loving , mask wearing person who can still pass it on and should be safe cus they are jabbed?
660	106119	@yevandy_ So scary. I'm just waiting for what people like them will say when the vaccine for COVID-19 comes out. It will be crazy 😂😂😂
661	201790	I'm so excited and relieved, I just booked my covid19 booster shot!!! Funny, it's EXACTLY 6 months to the day!!!
662	106136	Very stressful fews days helping to order in and set up the track and trace process for the Covid vaccine. Happy to see patients start to receive the vaccine, and proud to play a part in the first person in the world to receive it.
663	106443	@Lesliiiemarie so the “vaccine” is made then what? i never took a flu shot before. so it’ll be mandatory for everyone in the united states of america possibly the world to take the covid19 vaccine to be safe. ever wondered how many deaths a day from the flu?
664	107650	Kill me now. Waiting for a vaccine is pure idiocy and has zero scientific basis. There has never been a vaccine for a coronavirus, and it would be at best 30% effective, like a flu vaccine. It's a mutating virus. It's completely insane.
665	106282	@sunnydayrealaf @JamesonHook @KyleKulinski Actually, it’s something to do funds for a vaccine is why there is delay but with Covid-19 it’s impacted nearly everyone and the rich were or are losing money without workers to do their work. Funds has become available for Covid-19 because the economy was tanking
666	107468	This is why they are protesting,Why everyone else is not being denied American Covid-19 Vaccines &amp; these ppl in need, 90 miles away from Florida are not getting any aid?Wow...
667	107404	@subluxt @GeniusesqAx @Boy2020Patriot @CNN highly transmissible omicron variant — which has demonstrated an ability to evade coronavirus vaccines, leading to a surge in breakthrough infections so basically the vaccine is overblown?
668	105994	Coronavirus is FAKE NEWS because the government is pretending people are sick because they want to give everyone a vaccine that makes you sick because something something 5G Bill Gates another double vodka please Davy now that brings me to microchips...
669	105753	@252ALLMZ @deelightfulEP @Cleavon_MD @alaskarebel If you legitimately care to understand how the mRNA covid-19 vaccine safely works to build immunity without a killed virus, I’m happy to take the time to explain it all.  If you’re just an AV peddler of known lies, I hope no one ignorant to science or basic facts is exposed 2u.
670	105349	I love how this guy apparently has a knob somewhere he can just turn whenever he wants to give out more vaccine.If this number is so easily adjustable, cut the bullshit &amp; just send it all.A news article announcing the increase makes you look a like a douche who's holding out.
671	105202	W T F???  Lol.  Why would anyone want a vaccine with a 99.7% survival rate?  Not to mention you get a vaccine and still must follow the draconian, nonsensical mask nonsense.🙄.  Yeah I’ll pass.
672	105476	YET AGAIN!!!! Force us home &amp; require everyone that isn’t allergic to the vaccine to get it before they can work. Cause this is just stupid.
673	106747	A 90% effective vaccine that will deal with 20 or so mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (which causes the COVID-19 disease) is coming.  If offered, will you take it?
674	105618	@kman_blac @TheTNHoller @tnhousegop This is a novel coronavirus. Meaning they’ve never seen a virus like it before. Science takes time. The polio vaccine took decades to get right. It is a series of 4 shots giving to infants. We are at three shots now, 4 in Israel. It’s proven to save lives. Why fight it? #Science
675	106949	@DonnellyStephen On Pat Kenny talking about a vaccine passport? How come we don’t need one for measles? If you’re vaccinated surely it doesn’t matter then if I am? You’re an idiot! #COVID19 #CovidVaccine #lockdown2021
676	105286	Here’s one for any virologists/immunologists out there: if this Indian #Covid variant can partially evade antibodies of vaccinated people, will this not be an immediate catalyst for mutations which make it *completely* immune to the vaccines? How does this ever end?#COVID19
677	105521	@ANI So if I take the vaccine and something happens to me, then my family can't even sue the company I took vaccine of. Well then find a proper cure then only I will be taking it.@pmo @aajtak @AJEnglish @dwnews @ndtv #covid19
678	107647	@KAMRLocal4News Now they want help financially when the COVID-19 vaccine is free????? SMFH don't feel sorry for these people
679	107155	So I’m ngl my #NHSCovidVaccine has knocked me out today, woke up with possibly every side effect and felt awful, I’m drained and still don’t feel 100% but it’s all going to be worth it. So definitely go get your vaccine when you can! #CovidVaccine #COVID19

682	107607	@InteriorsAvenue @Kat_La @vinthropologist What do you call someone that is not against taking the MMR vaccine but not COVID-19 jab? Are they an antivaxxer? Or someone that has taken all vaccines that is against mandatory vaccination? Are they an antivaxxer?
683	107105	@DebtandCupcakes My understanding is that the specific virus that causes the common cold has enough mutation every year that we have to “re learn” how to fight itFlu vacc. are a “guess” on which strain is most commonI believe COVID-19 is unique enough and low mutation that vaccine would work
684	106574	My mom just received her first #COVID19Vaccine! The process was so fast and efficient, and everyone has been amazing. Thank you @ROWPublicHealth! #COVID19 #grateful #wrawesome
685	201679	So, I got my second dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine a bit under 24 hours ago. Feeling fatigued; weak in the limbs and joints. No fever (yet). Otherwise, nothing too serious.Please go get yours asap if you are eligible.
686	105221	**Genuinely Curious** If someone had caught #COVID19 &amp; had minor symptoms but their body built/grew antibodies to fight the virus why would they still need the Vaccine?

689	105206	@dkdmac ‘Myth: The COVID-19 vaccines don't work because you can still get COVID after vaccination.Fact: COVID-19 vaccination will protect most people from getting sick with COVID-19, ranging from 66% to 100% effective.’I think it’s clear that is not true. Everyone is still getting it.
690	105415	This world have went to hell since the coronavirus and the COVID-19 vaccine came here all of this is drawling people from the Lord and people don’t want to go church now because of it we need to be in church in this time what this world is going through we need to pray for world
691	105647	Some people think this coronavirus is a scar tactic... thinking that the vaccine was made back in 2017 or something but they seem to forget it’s a different strain...... meaning that the vaccine wouldn’t work.........
692	105371	@superdupergrump @MollyJongFast Fwiw I'm not some anti vaxxer. I get all my Dr reccd vaccines. How CV19 evolves is an unknown at this point. It could very well end up being like other coronavirus that aren't so much as deadly, as they are just an annual nuisance.
693	106271	@HelenBranswell @mariojoze EPIC is a problematic format 4 vaccine information, since EPIC was 1st developed as a billing system. QR codes are an elitist tool - many hv no smartphones. Better example is California's Blue Shield and Kaiser Permanente partnership in the CA COVID-19 vaccine rollout this year.
694	106036	Nice this is going to be @JoeBiden, Rioting and Looting with no recourse, send the vaccine to Iran and China before we give it to our own vulnerable people.  @joeb is a National Disgrace #BidenCrimeFamilyExposed #BidenCrimeFamily
695	105551	Vaccine maniacs say, well you took medicine for cancer so why don’t you just take the vaccine? I did due diligence on specific treatments and my doctors gave me the choice, never a mandate. I chose integrative treatments, natural and pharma, but it was my choice. #COVID19

700	105946	Wether people want to acknowledge it or not EVERYONE who has taken the jab is enrolled in the vaccine trials. EUA is not the same as an FDA approved. This is sad and never should have happened

710	107281	They should first prove to us that this vaccine is actually going to be a vaccine.&amp;that it will be to help reduce the symptoms of Covid19. If they are able to prove these two points,then people should take it.Yet just an experiment with vaccine is likely to yield few good results
711	106030	I don't understand why this is being promoted.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  This is not optics.  It's not strategic. It's not even coherent given the spotligbt on HQ and UV light therapy.#novaccines
712	106559	That's great for the US but no way Trump lets the rest of the world get any if they find the vaccine.
713	105445	I feel like it ought be stated up front that the person whom died was in the control group and did not recieve the vaccine.
714	106989	Here we go! So now every soulless dipshit will be dumping their pets in the streets or killing them. The C in pet vaccines (like DHLPP-C vax) is corona. Corona has existed FOREVER... it is the COMMON COLD. These MSM Morons are trying to create fear. DO NOT DUMP YOUR PETS! (con't)
715	106216	What’s wrong with this country? Are Gbajabiamila and all the people pushing that bill to pass going to line up and take the Coronavirus vaccine first? Even if they gave them money? How can they be pushing through a bill that will endanger their lives? #StoptheNCDCBill
716	105465	@QuintonLucasKC Why are people even discussing this. The common cold is a coronavirus and there has never been a successful vaccine or cure or even treatment for it. Covid-19 is a much more complex cv so it will not happen. Accept it. And if they do get one the virus will mutate making it void
717	107438	Whatsapp broadcast message dem bout fi turn right up... Might can get my vaccine fast tracked  when the conspiracy theorist dem come out heavy
718	106751	Here’s why Bill Gates wants indemnity… Are you willing to take the risk?Why are the world's top vaccine promoters, like Paul Offit and Peter Hotez, frantically warning us about the unique and frightening dangers inherent in developing a coronavirus vaccine?�
719	105500	One question to all: Do you think that current lockdown will be continued further after 21 days?!?🤔P.S. I am not asking if it should be or shouldn’t be, just, if it will be or not?!?😓#vaccines #SundayThoughts #lockdown #Stayhomestaysafe #CoronavirusPandemic #9बजे9मिनट
720	105869	This is exactly why anything .@ScottMorrisonMP and .@GregHuntMP say is just noise until there is an ACTUAL vaccine. #ScottyFromMarketing #LiarFromTheShire #COVID19Vic #COVID19Aus
721	106765	“And as with the other vaccines, scientists don't yet know if it stops people catching Covid”In essence , rolling out vaccines is still like running clinical trials .
722	106445	I have doubts regarding #Covid19 #vaccine #vaccination process in #India. 👇1)Is, it necessary for everyone to inject. If someone doesn't want?2)If anyone is already suffering from another disease?3)Side effects?4)How safe? #coronavirus #COVID20 #Doctor #doctors #delhi

724	106340	Got my covid-19 vaccine today. Got some arm pain. Just like I get with the flu vaccine.  Ni side effects.  I hope if you are eligible now to take please please do.  #CovidVaccine
725	106728	@g Same people will refuse to get a Covid-19 vaccine once it is developed and will contract the disease, spread it around and mor people will die needlessly.

728	105629	ok idk anything about this but why is CV19 research not just open source? wouldn't we be finding a vaccine quicker and then be able to manufacture it quicker?
729	105622	Many unknowns with one constant: Herd Immunity seems to be the only answer against the #PandemicCovid19, but how we achieve it differs. Vaccine or enough people get infected.
730	105907	Bottom line...until they come out with a vaccine for COVID19 and it's free, I'm most likely not going back to any kind of regular job dealing with the public. Certain controlled circumstances with trusted people, maybe. But the job world is fucked up right now.
731	105867	He tested negative and still has to sit. It's an insanely dumb rule. But, getting the vaccine isn't a big deal and he could have avoided these stupid rules but decided to risk it.
732	105475	@Noahpinion @NoahCRothman IIRC Chinavax was made with A coronavirus, not THE covid-19 because they were trying to beat everyone to market for prestige.They did. But it's not a covid vaccine and it doesn't protect like one.
733	105733	@ohiojennie @Idunnowhat6 @CNN There is no deadly virus. It has been a hoax all along. I had my account suspended, yesterday so, I lost all my video evidence. Copy and Paste this into Bitchute's search box and watch this video:  MATTEO ARENA ITALIAN MEDICAL DOCTOR WARNING AGAINST COVID-19 TEST AND VACCINE
734	106733	@DraftTulsi Thats my problem honestly it was made too fast. What will happen when another new coronavirus comes. Will they say the same vaccine is gonna work?
735	105547	Lockdown Will not stop the spread It will only slowdown the spread The only way to stop the covid19 is to made a vaccine @narendramodi
736	107319	@freep How could it possibly be a ‘reopening’ WITHOUT a 'coherent national' coronavirus plan in the US to get the virus under control and keep it that way!! Like a VACCINE!!! HOW?? 🤷🏽‍♂️

738	105301	But go ahead and inject yourself with the fucktard vaccine, the same virus you twits are afraid of! If immunity wears off, they’re going to try to scam you like the flu shot. Repeatedly injecting poison. #WakeUpPeople
739	107287	Giving vaccines to everyone is good idea but what about testing everyone?What is World's Best CM waiting for to Test every 11.40 Cr Population of Maharashtra?Why no one wants to test everyone but hell bent on giving vaccines before testing?
740	106618	no one wants this vaccine... especially those who are not sick, ('asymptomatic'='not sick')... stupid as hell to inject disease into your body... but ya'll are pushin' worse than drug dealers... tryin' to make folks think they want this... death... a crime against humanity (:~:)
741	106184	I know everyone is a bit nervous about getting the COVID-19 vaccine. I got mine today at 1026. I did it for my mom, my family, my friends, and my patients. I was a bit sentimental and cried because of those patients we lost despite everything we did. This was especially for them.
742	106481	when/if they come out with a covid-19 vaccine, will you be getting it or are you skeptical about the motives/agenda and decline the vaccine? 🤔
743	106948	You think they will tell you if the vaccine is safe for you before you take it? What about me? Better yet what about my kids? Will they be forced to take something made to kill them? You think something is wrong with me now let something happen to one of my kids. Life changing.
744	105627	I just got another nutty email about my column from Friday.  One of his crazy conspiracy theories is that Bill Gates refused the Covid vaccine because he's in the know and feels it's too dangerous.I don't have the heart to send this back to the person.
745	105673	@JamesDesmond99 @KerryAnnSmith1 As I keep pluggingCovid19 has no loyalty to any Political Party or Person.It only understands the Absolute state of the art, latest most science driven solutions until a workable safe vaccine arrives.Period.
746	201640	@FrancyDias9 ✋you bet i am wearing one in public. Plus vaccinated and a booster.  My sister died of covid19 before the vac. Came to the west coast.
747	105889	@leenorman54 The CMO said it is inevitable that everyone will get coronavirus over the next few years, just like the common cold that goes around and around. A vaccine may stop it, but that's a way off.
748	105381	So covid-19 antibodies may sometimes also respond to human proteins, causing autoimmune issues. The vaccines use the same protein to trigger the immune response, so may cause similar responses. This possibility is supported by an increased incidence of anaphylaxis
749	106670	@WhiteHouse @DeborahBirx How far away is a vaccine? Or information on why COVID-19 mutates so fast? Or what can slow it down once it enters lungs
750	201798	First it was take any shot you can get…so I took AZ….then it evolved to take any shot you can get but not AZ so I took Moderna….by the time I get to the booster will they be flat out giving only Pfizer?
751	106094	So Today, Moderna is leading the pack to develop a new vaccine for the SARS-coronavirus?  I guess it helps if you've been working on it a year before it happened.Such geniuses at Moderna!! How could they possibly know a SARS-coronavirus pandemic would come only 1 year later?
752	105240	This is how pharma companies make their money. It is not with a once a year vaccine it is the once-a-month, week, or day drug they push on you. The covid drug will become something you will need to take monthly, weekly, or even daily. Are you freakin awake yet!!!
753	107376	"@Independent Can you still get Covid after the vaccine? YES, YOU CAN. You can still spread coronavirus,even after getting the vaccine so continue to wear a Face Mask 😷!Don't be an "" Ignorant Imbecile""!"
754	105709	@jonslinn @PienaarJm @plaforscience No, I don't think you understand - the suggestion is that the inflenza vaccine it makes the elderly more susceptible to severe illness from Covid19.   Vaccines interact with immune systems, this may not always be beneficial.
755	105553	@philhowells @chrischirp The fact you have had two jabs and still got it is very revealing.My hunch is now, if you are ok and clear it, you will not catch it again this year and if you do next year, it will feel the same as a more common coronavirus cold.
756	106526	"Oh yes, this is a thing. When I went to get my second jab in September, this lady was making a call obviously to one ""Alhaji"" communicating in Hausa telling him she'd do it clean once she sees the alert."

758	105748	Honest question here... If a person had the measles, they don't need the vaccine. If a person had covid-19 why do they need the vaccine?
759	106075	"@CanadaTruth1867 @tahmina_aziz @CHEK_News COVID vaccines are ""flame retardants, not impenetrable firewalls, when it comes to the coronavirus""which is why (given the penchant for anti-vaxxers to aggressively confront those who disagree with them) this person is wearing a mask"
760	107649	Come on students.. Wouldn't it be better to get the vaccine but not need it, or NOT get vaccined and you are wrong.. #COVID19 💉
761	107540	"@SukiDog @boste3332 @eden52292269 @philerup @CNN None of the coronavirus or influenza shots are true vaccines. They don't prevent infection. The word ""vaccine"" relates specifically and root derivatively to ""cow pox"" but the medical community uses it loosely.  I gave you the answer - not my fault you can't grasp it."
762	105774	@zchagla It's a coronavirus. They can form part of the answer, but utter obsession in vaccinating the whole population with a vaccine that only has emergency use authorisation is downright odd. More so when in relation to those who are not vulnerable to the disease itself.
763	106981	Mark my golden words. China is gonna come up with the vaccine first and gonna charge billions from every country.
764	105424	Woke up to news of a Covid-19 vaccine coming to Lebanon in the next two months... even if it doesn't happen, this gave me an ounce of hope.

766	106527	We all need to work together to protect the world from #COVID19. Will states please step up and release much needed funds for response efforts to @WHO @CEPIvaccines and @gavi? Together, we can beat this pandemic.
767	105228	This guy is an idiot. Whoever creates a coronavirus vaccine should be bill Gates rich. Of course the publjc shouldn't pay but right now we want this to be pharmas no 1 incentive.
768	201705	@PurpleTurtles33 I am vaccinated and my spouse is not I got the original covid-19 vaccine not the delta yet so my immune system is also compromised and so I am in the same situation you are
769	106597	@mmckoy I keep on having this feeling that they will attempt to mandate the coronavirus vaccine. Thoughts?
770	105995	@TVRav These measures are going to be in place for a long time. People keep saying wait until September. September will be the same. Not all students will be back in. Social distancing is not going anywhere as without a vaccine Covid-19 is not going anywhere.

772	107217	If Biden wins, we will be wearing masks for the next several years. Then, when the people in our country get beat down hard enough, everyone will be begging to take a vaccine.

775	107233	How does the government plan to regulate all of this, is my question. I mean yeah, this got a bunch of media attention so it's gonna get shut down, but it's not like armed guards are going to be standing in front of vials of the vaccine or anything
776	201564	Aight so, I didn’t want to get vaccinated, but my daughter thought I was going to die (I’d already had covid) if I didn’t get the jab.  Here’s my question: how many of you that have gotten the vaccine now have ear problems? #VaccineSideEffects #COVID19
777	201685	@ryanfield The vaccine is just a money maker for Pfizer and it doesn't eradicate the virus and because it doesn't the shot will have to be updated and given at least four times of year. I get COVID-19 at this point it's like getting a cold because I've had 3 shots. I've had enough.
778	106370	A vaccine may never come.None came for HIV.We MAY die if we re-open for business, yes. But, we WILL die if we stay locked down too long. Living has risks. Which do you choose?

786	105388	@EastSideJay99 @AmyAThatcher Just one quick point to forestall your first gotcha: the scientific name of covid-19 is SARS-COV-2. This is the same virus family that caused the original SARS outbreak mentioned in Scrubs, way back when. That this vaccine was developed in a year is a bad faith argument.

790	107013	They Don’t know how long after you have had Covid that you may get sick again. It could be you will never get sick for the rest of your life from Covid. They don’t know but they know if you get the vaccine do you have a 70% chance of getting Covid. 🤔

I would like to know, if adverse reactions to the Covid-19 vaccine are common incidents these days and if so, have these exponentially gained momentum? I hear so many of my friends having problems after their boosters. So I am not taking any.
796	107516	PLEASE RT!  Besides numerous deaths of some of Pfizer's C-19 vaccine volunteers, now this! Is this vaccine really an infertility vaxx? Just one more reason NOT to get any of these vaccines. Instead, eat healthy and beef up your immune system AND🚫annual Flu Vaccine
797	107121	I think it might not come such a time in my view. Once a pandemic it remains in circulation as long as transmission patterns don't change. We need WHO, CDC and all players to come up with vaccine as we adhere to containment measures given by MOH. Likewise, we commit it to God.
798	105848	Still no news on when I might could get a coronavirus vaccine, but I sure have gotten multiple news alerts pushed to my devices updating me on the whereabouts of Lady Gaga's dogs. What an age we live in.
799	106387	I’m iffy on mandatory vaccines, maybe since I was a hesitant one, but hospitals I think it’s the right call. Same with home care. If you are working hands in with the vulnerable like this you gotta protect yourself
800	105287	Love when clinical trials work themselves out like this. Slow down and do it the correct way and stop trying to be the first company to make a vaccine because you want the funding
801	105534	@Stratusdog42 @CBCNews Agreed. The sign shows that there has never been a vaccine for any coronavirus ever and all have phased out due to strong T cell immunity.
802	105640	WHO doctor says lockdowns should not be main coronavirus defenceThe US is starting to work smart in SEVERAL counties and states, the only numbers going up is the number of people with adverse reactions from the so called VACCINES. So why do we insisti in this stupidity?

Why do you think they make a new flu vaccine each year?
815	105384	So it has come to my attention that in my clip from the movie @MedicatingNorm1 involving @kellybroganmd and it turns out this person is Anti-Vax. Make no mistake Vaccines save lives. Coronavirus is real and unfortunately I made a mistake by not doing a google search.
816	105785	And further.  I am tired of being treated and spoken to as if I am a disease, because I live in Toronto.  I do not live my life as if getting rid of Covid19/21 is my primary goal in life. Neither do I live my life waiting for some miraculous vaccine.  There is a life to live.
817	107213	I will not take the vaccine bc @BillGates is involved &amp; wants to put a micro nano-chip in the vaccine. The govt would have to guarantee they did not put anything in the vaccine.
818	105439	There will always be another variant. Fear controls; we proved it for them last year. Why are they pushing this one experimental vaccine when they never have before? So much so they are 'free'?#ImpeachBidenHarris#CovidFarce #FireFauci

831	107116	@rachsyme I’ll leave you with this. The best Vaccine ever achieved by mankind took 5 Years. It stops Malaria with 97% accuracy. No vaccine is ever at 100%. Whatever the hell they have concocted in just 11 months will be roughly 65% - 75% accurate. Covid-19 virus is mutating as well.
832	106581	If you think the process of getting a test is bad wait until there is a vaccine for #COVID19. #HungerGames here we come!
833	106000	@MrSammy_H @ninnyd101 HIV is in the corona virus. Not it was added to the vaccine. The coronavirus is made up with hiv genes
834	105608	@NazmusN @GertMaude @robert_cali08 @donchartier You mentioned anti-vaxx. Gates/coronavirus/vaccine.Try and keep up.
835	106008	@HeidiGiokos #Fraud and #CORRUPTION like this preventing my parents who are 77 and 72 from getting #COVID19 vaccine. Registered both my parents, mum got her voucher last week Thurs and dad is still waiting for his. @Clicks_SA Sunninghill claim no vaccines since Thurs
836	105506	I doubt it. They might get injected with water...  in order for this vaccine to work properly at least 30% of the humanity has to take it... we will see good results in 2 years...
837	105299	"@brenda092970 @rhollor3 @ChancellorTV he didn't lie. He stated ""Yeah, I've been immunized""did he say he took the COVID shot?The vaccine doesn't stop the virus. It reduces the symptoms. The virus is called SARS-Cov-2The vaccine deals with COVID-19 which is the symptoms not the virus"
838	105876	@WIRED Just now GOD/ALLAH/SHIV has suggested one mentioned below vaccine for this Coronavirus ---------
839	201508	"@KOINRich Condolences to your family.In March I called my Dr. I expressed concerns about my chronic illnesses &amp; the vaccine. She told me, ""Nothing is worse than getting #COVID19 so get vaxxed. Any side effects? We'll deal with them."" No problems with Moderna, booster shot tommorow. 😷✌️❤️"
840	201511	As a caregiver for a 93 year old hospice patient I was exposed to #COVID19 last week. She caught it from her UNVACCINATED daughter. 1 out of 4 caregivers were unvaccinated. 1 out of 4 caught covid. I had my 2nd negative test this morning. #VaccinesWork #MaskUp @RonDeSantisFL
841	107019	So...what exactly does this mean? That vaccines won’t do shit? That we’re all just going to get reinfected until we die?
842	106955	@MayorofLondon I have already my Covid-19 vaccine 💉 and I have to go back to have my second half vaccine 💉 in 3 weeks times
843	106767	Lots of BC institutions have walked back promises they made in August regarding soft vaccine mandates. I think they're hoping we're all too tired and worn out to notice. I fear they're right.
844	105934	@DianaRyall There's always a lag with flu shots, too, as they become available each year. But the idea that they can't make the covid19 vaccine compulsory for aged care workers, when flu shots already are, is bizarre.
845	107559	"Being someone identified by the government as being in the ""vulnerable group"", apparently we will be offered the #COVID19 #vaccine first. I'm going to pass thank you. I never have my flu vaccine and I've been fine. I'll refuse the test and vaccine, even if it becomes law. (CR)"
846	106189	@POTUS is touting a #coronavirus vaccine that will come out soon. This is not good news. What is really going on?#BillGatesVirus #FireFauci #hoodwinked
847	105691	Okay, I'm all for vaccines and whatnot but, like, no one is going to line up for a fourth or fifth shot. Sorry.
848	107377	@manisharoses My biggest parenting problem is  covid-19 quite frankly. But a smaller one is: are they going back to school in the fall?  We don't know. One parent is high risk (&amp; maybe not protected by the vaccine), things change month to month. We don't want to get their hopes up, or down.
849	107297	"I've often wondered why tfg's supporters aren't crowing from the house tops that ""their guy"" got three vaccine through testing so quickly, then why they didn't go get it! Stupid is as stupid does..."
850	106621	@BgSniper6ft7 @McLethalson @SInow @SNYNets Covid-19 is a virus not a bacteria. Not sure what meds KDs on but if he's on antibiotics it's for something else. Regardless, yeah, it's frustrating but they are being as safe as they can be and I think they're distributing the vaccine in the right order.
851	201499	Received my second dose of #COVID19 #PfizerBioNTech #vaccine this morning 💪💉 so far so good just a sore arm fingers crossed 🤞 I don’t have any other side effects #thankful #healthcare #Professional 💪💙💪 https://t.co/lQhS8RzFLL
852	106585	Canadians who refuse to take a free vaccine when offered and subsequently get COVID-19 don’t deserve free healthcare. They should also be held responsible for the damage to anyone else they infect throughout the their negligence.Change my mind.

859	106796	I just want to understand why a vaccine from the US for COVID19 is being tested in Africa when the US is the hardest hitting the world! They should test it on their own people!
860	105203	People like this should be fined! You don’t want the vaccine then Stay home.  Stop endangering others.
861	201680	when pkp started in march 2020, my body was actually okay, i wasnt as fit as 2019 but my body was goodthen my internship from november to february, then ramadhan, then i get my first jab.over a year of unable to work out. Now masa nak start balik dpt second jab on 19. HAHAHA
862	107390	Now they are wearing disguises to get vaccines so their friends and family won’t know that they are not, in fact, owning the libs by refusing the vaccine. Conservative logic is really hard to understand, but it’s so hilarious at times. Your party is straight garbage.
863	106691	@maxtaves @__Chimaera Well makes sense according to a poll I just say 81% of democrats WOULD get a COVID19 vaccine. While only 49% of republicans WOULD. How are we to recover if is this is so political and if they don’t get the vaccine we don’t beat it??
864	201793	Two whole days after my #CovidVaccine shot... the soreness in my shoulder is a lot better. It’s there, but better. Still no fever, no maladies, no side effects that I can detect. #CoronaVaccine #modernavaccine #coronavirus #COVID19
865	106959	@HealthCareRenew @RepGosar You know that fast or slow, the virus IS going to spread, right?That there's NEVER been a vaccine for a Coronavirus? That masks can't stop the spread?That herd immunity doesn't mean no one will ever catch it again?
866	105564	So depressing.  We're going to limp along half open until hopefully a vaccine is available while the rest of the world will be able to get back to normal after containing the virus.
867	106589	You just wanna say China is the new model right, and CCP’s lockdown the way to go for the world? Why don’t you say even American vaccine is “falling behind” China and Russia?
868	201620	When I assumed I had Covid19 after losing my ability to taste any food and smell. I only used my nasal spray for sinuses then suddenly taste buds were back and smell. I believe there’s many ways to deal with this virus without a vaccine.
869	105909	This is a creepy tweet.I dont know about you guys but i feel like theres going to be #covid19 2.0 released soon. But this time its going to contain the real thing.1st phase didn't get the traction they hoped for, 2nd phase could be deadly. Could it be the Vaccine?#StayAlert

873	106424	1. Some one in my family said to me Why should I get the Covid 19 vaccine they are fit and healthy .My answer was well. If you don't want to be classified by the rest of the family as a covid-19 carrier and become an outcast of the family get the vaccine done
874	107192	So Lord Northam are you going to mandate we get a vaccine too when it comes out? And I'm not anti vaccine. I'm anti tyrannical government mandates. #wreckitralph #Virginia #ralphnortham
875	106098	If you’ve been hesitant about the vaccine, this is the time to get it if you are able. The vaccines are free, readily available, and effective, as the current hospitalizations show (nearly all unvaccinated).

888	106782	I got a flu shot last November and got the flu this past March. Even if we get coronavirus vaccine, it’s not going to be a sudden cure-all.
889	107139	"@AndersonLim13 If you want to take this vaccine, then go for it. I'm just skeptical with a coronavirus vaccine—doesn't mean I'm an ""anti-vaxxer"" though. I still take the flu shot because I trust it."
890	105420	@stephlynn1982 @ScaryLikeAFoxx @e_galv Covid-19 is a disease, not a virus, so it can't be a vaccine. If you meant sars-cov-2 and implied it was a vaccine, it would be a pretty shitty/failed vaccine. The theory is that it started out with the intention of being used for a vaccine for a different coronavirus.

896	107288	@ztelling1230 @SteveBolton17 @EliasPELIAS1 @cnnbrk The PRIMARY strategy should always have been (as in other countries) to prevent the spread by an intense &amp; efficient Test, Trace &amp; Isolate program, nipping it in the bud.

906	105389	"@jym_m @Martina Why was the coronavirus referred to as the ""novel coronavirus""? What does novel mean in this instance? It's not a book you read. It's means new or unknown.

910	106389	@MWoody21454002 @caseyjo56279819 @grantstern No vaccine is 100% effective. But in this case, the benefit is that you will almost certainly survive COVID-19 if you do get it. For the past month or so, virtually all of the fatalities were among the unvaccinated.

912	107496	@beardalaxy @kjenipher_ @callingyou0ut_ @imjustinrandall They've been developing/studying coronavirus vaccines for nearly 20 years. What they did in the last 6 months is similar to what they do with the flu vaccine every year- hone it to be effective against a specific strain of a virus. They didn't start at square one 6 months ago.

917	106679	@NateSilver538 They would not be known to be safe if used together. One problem with coronavirus is the virus actually doesn’t do a lot of damage. Most of the disease is unchecked inflammation. We want a vaccine to prevent that fire not make it worse.
918	107668	If you take this vaccine you are a total fool. Even Bill Gates said a Coronavirus vaccine will kill 700k+ each year taken. This is a cull. The biggest fear is we become herd immune to it. They are rushing the real killer this vaccine ASAP.
919	106455	@chridano @thejuraisout @DanHitchings @VancityReynolds @jessicamalaty Nope! Covid19 is a strain of coronavirus called SARS‑CoV‑2. Researchers have been working on a generic vaccine for SARS viruses for years. They were able to build on that research. Because Covid is so infectious and has spread so quickly, they have been able to test widely.
920	106784	Sad to say, @AviBittMD, you did just miss out this whole time. I noticed it way back in Nov 2020. Bolt out of bright blue in my home country. Global scourge. But #ivermectin could work against it as #antisemites are loathsome creatures and also parasites. #COVID19 #vaccines
921	107480	@bennyjohnson @tedcruz China is weaponizing viruses and covid-19 has been a test.  It crashed the entire world economies so to then it's a success.  Oh and by the way, they now have a vaccine and my guess is the upper echelons of their government had it for months.

924	105359	There is no way to know that in two weeks. Also if it turns out to be 'no' just like with delta we can still expect the jab to be shoved down our throats. Calling it now, they will say only the 'boosted' are protected

948	107610	@Ms_Michelle_Roy @MarkFriesen08 It's not a vaccine. mRNA is a medical device. It makes you produce viral proteins for what is suspected to be Covid-19 as we do not have this virus isolated and cultured. If we did, we would have an actual vaccine for it. Not going to risk an autoimmune issue like Cytokine Storm.
949	201749	I’m over 50 and trying to make an appointment for my COVID-19 vaccine but the ACT booking line is overwhelmed and their online booking system won’t accept my Medicare number. At a later attempt told I was 96th in the queue on the phone. Not a lot of vaccine hesitancy here.
950	106828	So if the so called vaccine for covid19 fails or leads to more deaths do u think the rest of the world will find out about it? I know they didn't talk about the failed 1 in Brasil something to think about.
951	106292	What is it all about. I'm talking about the sudden spike in Coronavirus all round the world. Quite convenient don't you think. It's a good job we have a vaccine waiting to save the planet. If you are the one waiting for a vaccine   I wish you well, you may just need it...
952	105798	Why is Bill Gates so pro-vaccine? Is any other rich billionaire donating so many millions of dollars towards a vaccine!? 🤔
953	106278	Making a vaccine for Coronavirus is not as complicated as making one for AIDS or cancer. It is in the same family as the flu and other Covid viruses. They make a new flu shot every year to predict which strain will be most prominent. This is why the C19 vaccine was made so quick
954	106934	@DrTomFrieden How come none of those vaccines made it to market?  This is not like other coronavirus, just going to ignore that particular issue?
955	105440	@GOP keep promoting the anti-vaccine silliness. Is wearing you and your followers down slowly but surely. Blame Trump for downplaying the virus and running off to play golf, only to eventually get his shots, never to confirm it. No sympathy if you play with fire, and get burnt.
956	106421	Remember in May, when Trump said the coronavirus is “going to go away without a vaccine … and we’re not going to see it again, hopefully, after a period of time” ?
957	105306	Before kids go back to SCHOOL THEY NEEDED VACCINES OR THEY would get FINDED So What's the difference you don't treated me LIKE trash and kill me and your own people
958	105555	Cuba has a large biotech sector and has to be self sufficient because of the U.S. trade embargo and sanctions.  Cuba 🇨🇺 developed its own vaccine and has a history of distributing it too other countries like Pakistan. #Covid19
959	105268	This is why the answer can’t be rushed. A vaccine will be developed but don’t rush and cut corners to try and get there.
960	105519	A career in my field, financial stability, my student loans paid off, and a vaccine for Covid-19 would be nice.
961	107282	@wane15 Nobody is applying is why.  This whole $15 minimum wage an hour mentality has destroyed the balance.  Also Covid-19 welfare checks too. I as many were making $900 plus a week setting home off work playing video games. It’s going to be much worse if vaccine mandates are imposed.
962	107354	Yes, I am going to get my mouse friend vaccinated but I’m certainly going to monitor little RatFace for a few weeks before I take take the Kamala vaccine.
963	105708	These vaccines are not worth the side effects that are happening I for one am not going to take that chance I've had Bell's Palsy I still do to an extent and it's bad people it's bad
964	201694	Well this is ironic.  Mum’s just had a letter offering her a #COVID19 jab because she’s my ‘carer’, but I haven’t received my letter.How odd.
965	106408	@JordanSchachtel If you're getting the annual flu shot, you're getting boosters for the ongoing Swine Flu, which is now endemic... as is COVID19.  If they'd just be up front about how COVID is acting like a normal flu... no.... no, we can't have that. No money in it. Not enough fear.

C19 have been heavily politicized and there never have been any successful flu / coronavirus vaccine ever developed. No long term RCT's too.
972	106220	So this morning I mentioned feeling weird about asking, but I did end up seeing this guy tonight and I asked him if he's vaxxed. He said he got the first Moderna but never went back for the second. Sir!🤦🏾‍♀️ Why are we only half vaxxed? He said his job has someone coming next week!

977	107509	80% (or as close as we can get) vaccine coverage and rolling booster shots (like we do with flu) and I'll accept we need to move on. Until then we're just accepting unnecessary death.  Restrictions can't last forever which is why we need to ramp up vaccines globally.
978	105679	Not convinced this is safe until we have a vaccine for Covid-19 as being stuck in a crowded train will spread the virus big time especially if someone doesn't wear a mask and has it even if they don't know they're infected
979	106801	See how when the vaccines started to roll out in March and April the spread went down 😃Now see how there’s a big population that doesn’t like it and it’s all worse How does that logic work someone explain it to me how do you see it get better and say it’s bad
980	107357	@TAHPAO2019 @debbiehockey @EmmaKennedy In the case of Covid-19 there is currently no herd immunity. Without a vaccine that is a long long way off.It is spelt 'herd'.The moment you called ma a 'thicko' you lost any respect I may have had for you or your position.Have a good day.
981	201725	So, my daughter had covid in January, got the vaccine in May, was diagnosed with covid again today. I decided to get the vaccine today &amp; within 1 hour had a severe reaction. Tell me again what the vaccines are doing to stop covid?#vaccine #COVID19 #vaccinesdontwork
982	105397	Everybody who died following a covid19 vaccine is a victim, until a post mortem carried out.  That is 100'000s.  No wonder they don't do post mortems.
983	105634	@timbuctoo123 @prayingmedic Dr. Mikovits stated that anyone who has received the flu vaccine will test positive for Covid-19 because of the way they create the vaccine. She also says that wearing masks will actually activate any viruses we have because you are breathing your own carbon dioxide.curious

989	105200	@SaraGrossman @JGForsyth I'm sure treatment will get better but a vaccine is not guaranteed, no one has ever made a vaccine for a coronavirus before, and there were questions raised about if it would give neutralising immunity. I do hope you're right though.

1004	105457	@LoyalAlbertz @Rich1738_ @piersmorgan That’s funny because the first vaccine for coronavirus (from the papers I have read) was developed in 2002. SARS is caused by Coronavirus hence SARS- CoV. This again originated in China circa 2002.
1005	106549	@jamieuk88 @SkyNews Are you serious? The whole world is crippled by Covid-19 and the only way to help manage it and get life back to normal is the vaccine. I can’t stand the man, but he should be advising everyone to get it. What’s more important right now over this? Idiots like you are the problem.
1006	106430	I'm one of those people that can't get the vaccine. please read this and understand why it's so important for you to do so to protect me.
1007	106894	What is everyone’s realistic expectations of #COVID19? It’s not going away. People will still spread it like other viruses. A rushed #coronavirus vaccine will take awhile to be effective, if at all. People are going to die...it’s inevitable.

1009	106714	@arahman97 @nearlysilenty @NamelessWander4 @fussysisyphus @tamarasharf It’s a great question because the answer helps better understand the reason the #VACCINE could be developed so fast - when they started, it wasn’t from scratch. There was already a great deal of coronavirus research they could build on to tackle this *new* coronavirus/ #Covid_19
1010	106201	@StephieLynn204 @texaninthewoods @DrEricDing @VickiGSP @IndependentSage You think this virus that’s killed millions of people in just ove a year is beat now? Good luck with that idea.

1011	106298	I had wondered if what really strains healthcare resources is vaccine skeptics who don't go to the hospital until their symptoms are extremely bad, maybe if they went earlier they could've survived the Covid illness, and easier for hospital staff too - no ICU, no venting, etc.
1012	106666	@PharmaBlue And they don’t want to give vaccines to the pharmacists when they aren’t even offering health benefits for these positions. So we just risk getting COVID-19 and then pay out of pocket if we get sick?? 🤯

1015	106181	Very realistic. I don't think people understand how important J&amp;J is. They don't have to make sure you are covered for both doses like with Pfizer and Moderna. They can get the vaccine, stab you, and move on.

1020	107229	@ComfortablySmug We've never been able to develop an anti-viral drug or vaccine for any coronavirus ever.To believe this will work, in a matter of months, for a NOVEL virus on top of it.... it's insane.

If we are comparing the smallpox vaccine and the Covid-19 vaccine the I think it is fair to say it took about a year since the first cases were recorded in November. But the question is, could we have gotten a vaccine earlier?
1028	106402	@SueReed31273001 @richardhorton1 Highly unlikely it will until we know the ling term effects of covid19. Oxford has recently begun a study to address these concerns, but it will take a couple of months for us to see any results. If they want to do challenge studies this will delay the release of a vaccine.

1062	106859	There are costs incurred with our without a vaccine registry.    The more accurate question is if the cost is greater when we don't keep track. This has been a long-pursued goal of public health for decades.  #COVID19 represents the current pressing need.  There will be others.
1063	107621	Covid-19 is in every corner of this world, we need to work together to get rid of this pandemic. Mask up, sanitize and if you get a chance to a vaccine, take one.

1070	106681	If you are thinking that once a vaccine is developed this will all go away, consider testing:A test was developed in January. In March Trump promised on-demand testing, including an app for easy implementation.In Sept Herbert promised on-demand testing for Utahns. Today:
1071	105803	@Coronavirusgoo1 @Bringon2021Kona @DanielB220201 I think the Oxford one will eventually end up being our prime one.. they were streets ahead of everyone else developing a vaccine in the first place having already partially had one in production for a similar Coronavirus meant to tackle another strain in Africa.
1072	201562	Walked in to @cvspharmacy for my second Moderns shot yesterday. Didn't make an appt, bring my insurance card, or bring my #COVID19 vaccine card, and they still got me the shot. #NoExcuses
1073	106561	But they’re not getting the real vaccine! This is the biggest lie that will befall on the American people! Do not trust the Deep State!
1074	106403	Fact: No, COVID-19 vaccines have not been linked to infertility after COVID-19 infection. There is no vaccine microchip, and the vaccine will it affect the vaccine?

1076	105280	@kayleighmcenany He's so adorable how he fast tracked the Coronavirus vaccine to the ultra rich, then when people got mad he threated to not give anyone the vaccine.
1077	107073	@SDoughtyMP can you help get some sense on why my GP surgery won't update the WIZ so I can't get my vaccine that all others with Coeliac are getting?
1078	105859	JUST FUCKING TAKE THE COVID-19 VACCINE.I know you will still get the virus, but it prevents you from reuniting with the creator.
1079	107102	@resisterunited @RepThomasMassie What you’re wanting to do is perpetually be inoculated for a strain that doesn’t exist because you’ll never be able to make a vaccine quick enough. This is why coronavirus vaccines don’t make any sense, let alone use tech that doesn’t have lasting effects.
1080	105765	@TheEconomist Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
1081	106876	@starsandstripes Can I ask why??? If getting the shot doesn’t help not get Covid-19 and only helps you fight it IF you catch it. So why the fuss if the shot doesn’t help not catch Covid-19? I could understand if it defeated Covid out right but the vaccine doesn’t do this.
1082	201655	In early 2020 my Rottweiler jumped on my back and landed just the right way to break one of my vertebrae. In December 2021 I contracted COVID-19 despite being fully vaxxed and fully masked. The possibility of slipping and falling on ice no longer scares me.

1086	106416	@CowgerCathey @duncan_colton @deja_vu40 @stella_immanuel There is a reason no one has engaged this tweet!There is a conspiracy to silence any dissenting voice so the pharm companies can sell COVID-19 vaccine.
1087	105315	Fraud Alert: Scammers are calling requesting payment information for the COVID-19 vaccine, stating if not provided you will be removed from the list for the COVID-19 vaccine shot. THIS IS A SCAM. No one should call you requesting this information.
1088	106143	So what!The vulnerable are vaccinated.  Everyone who wants a vaccine have it.  The death rate has fallen even while PCR positives are up. It's now the flu.
1089	106108	@Liz_Wheeler No, no he isn't. There's a high likelihood (though not yet conclusively proven) that we can protect vaccine-intolerant people from contracting COVID-19 if enough of us receive the vaccine, including our healthy kids. Herd immunity is basic vaccine science.

1096	105542	@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Well dumbass a couple people died that were test subjects. Do you want a vaccine now or do you want to wait until it's safe? There has never been a vaccine for any Coronavirus.

1115	105725	@krishgm The covid19 vaccine has been in development since the H1N1 outbreak, if you spoke to the researchers who had their budgets cut they would tell you that if they had £1 million a year, they could have had this vaccine available.  Look up pandemic on @netflix

1119	106294	maybe it doesn't work because #COVID19 is an alien #bioweapon surely the alien #bioterrorists work out a way of engineering the virus so no known drug on earth would defeat #COVID19 hence the need for a vaccine
1120	106554	@lambechoppe @micheal_olainn @MaryKenny4 Not to my knowledge. But wasn’t there one tested for the Swine flu? Anyone aware of its results? To my knowledge there has been no successful vaccine to date for ANY coronavirus. Please do correct me if I’m mistaken!

1122	106102	@amethystarlight @andykopsa @daswenson We were never going to eliminate the virus from the planet. That was clear in early 2020. These vaccines may eventually eliminate severe disease and reduce incidence. My hope is (and has been) it’ll just become another “seasonal” coronavirus.
1123	105786	This header is going to scare people to not take the vaccine, it’s very misleading. Read the story before you RT...
1124	107258	@garymasonglobe  Do you know if Canada has signed an agreement with Oxford University AstraZeneca to receive the promising Covid-19 vaccine if it is approved?   The European Union, Australia and many other countries have done so. I cannot find the answer.
1125	107616	“The coronavirus vaccine can sometimes cause an allergic reaction?? No way I’m getting it.” Wait till you find out what COVID can do to you.
1126	105801	@OAmollo Skepticism in vaccine delay are expected but consider COVID-19 as airbon virus that rapidly  spreads but the immune system can naturally neutralize there4 it is the lesser one and HIV is problematic with the way it reproduces , all vaccine failed including our KEMRON.

1168	106462	@goshorn_s @sjocello I am also not an anti-vaccination person. I agree that I would also get the coronavirus vaccine if Dr. Fauci says it is 100% safe. He is the only person in @realDonaldTrump's administration that I trust.

1177	105438	China's rapid test kits are 94% faulty, we know what 'Made in China' stands for.Seems like China wants to use Pakistanis as lab rats for their vaccine's human trial and these stupids are cheering it. 🤷🏻‍♂️🤐#Coronavirus #ChineseVirus #WHOhanVirus #WuhanVirus #ChinesePropaganda

1180	105449	I don’t know what’s more amazing, that the microchip is so small that no one has actually found it in the vaccine yet, or that something designed as a conduit to microchip the world population is also so effective against coronavirus. Science man.

1183	105828	This is coming fast and furious. Your vaccine status may get you into restaurants, theatres, sporting events, cultural events, hotels, planes and concerts. What do we need to consider as we roll this out? @bmj_latest #GetTheJab #VaccinesWork
1184	107108	On to the next clinical phase! To see if the vaccine is able to produce the same neutralising antibodies against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in humans #COVID19
1185	105616	I think there is still much uncertainty regards everything to do with this virus Covid19 that only time will tell? How can you know about immunity when the virus is only 5-6 months old? Even the efficacy of vaccine can't be hundred percent correct until trials confirm success.
1186	107296	No! What we will be remembering is how the UK failed so badly in dealing with COVID-19 and how it tried to claim credit for a vaccine developed in Germany, led by German-Turkish scientists and manufactured in Belgium !!

1189	106788	@RMGirlUK It shows if your immune system has responded to the Covid-19 vaccine as it should.I don’t think it’s a bullet proof guarantee as we don’t know what level of antibodies is ‘enough’ yet but I’m pretty happy with over 2,000 -it provides some reassurance my vaccine will protect me.

1197	105743	I'm calling this bullshit 👇👇👇They maintain their experimental vaccine, without long term data, known to not protect you from the virus but expected to reduce the symptoms, is better protection than your immune system after you've had the virus??

1201	105992	Thats wonderful news. 3 vaccine data released in a span of 30 days is tremendous. More exciting is the fact that these were developed in under a year when it actually takes a decade to develop! Kudos to all brilliant scientists, doctors and engineers 👏🧬🙏🏽

1215	106225	In terms of preventing infection, I have to say that vaccines are pretty much similar. There's a chance, even if it's 5% or 50%. However a vaccine's main job is to train your immune system to make the right antibodies. If it can do that, then it's effective.

1305	107222	@jwaldag @liberal_party @erinotoole Here’s a story I just heard from my dentist-apparently #tamarajansen went to get her #COVID19 vaccine but didn’t bring any ID. Her response to my dentists sister who is a pharmacist was “Don’t you know who I am?” She replied “Yes, you are an….
1306	106029	Did they need a vaccine? No. Did they equate the only possible response to Covid-19 is a Vaccine? No. Did they ban flights and acted fast to opt for medical solution? Yes. Duterte's take only having the vaccine as the only solution is evident enough to say...
1307	107278	Please take any Coronavirus surveys from the DNA companies so we can help find a vaccine or a medical solution to this pandemic. It only takes a few minutes of your time. I know that MyHeritage is doing a survey. I did my part.
1308	201666	Last Wednesday, April 7th 2021;My hubby and I drove to Nephi, Ut. to get my 2nd #COVID19 shot. By evening I had some pain in my arm, where the shot was and I massaged it, helping to break up the liquid of the vaccine. I started getting Chills, Fever,Nassau with vomiting, etc.😷 https://t.co/j8hykENFTI
1309	105757	@nirav_mainecdc Discrepancies in reporting. Maine is getting more/less vaccines depending upon different sources. How convenient! Less vaccines fits narrative of why Maine is not prioritizing long-term care facilities? Outrageous! Do not try to say that you are doing a good job!
1310	106539	25 million #COVID19 Vaccines is not even a drop in the bucket compared to the world's need. It's time to #SAVE the world and Share America's Vaccines with Everyone. #VOWNow #ShareTheShots
1311	105567	Hydroxychloroquine has proven to be a real treatment for COVID-19 but since Trump was the first one to say it, the left and the FDA are going to make sure they keep it away from Americans so they can promote another Bill Gates vaccine. #Hydroxychloroquine #WakeUpAmerica
1312	105871	@juil_yoon @oclsc @TheoMoudakis @TorontoStar See they claim to do research yet sound like lunatics. Did you even fukin know that when the polio or the measles came out, people took a vaccine immediately with way less data than today’s very effective and safe Covid19 vaccine. Where is the polio today? Time to grow up kids
1313	107609	Why should either one of them get a vaccine for a hoax? They should’ve been last in line for all the death they’ve caused!
1314	107004	@mrscorer Think you need to do a bit of research. They are between 40-60% and we’ve had the flu vaccine for 70+ years. People believed Covid-19 vaccines were 95% effective in 9 months 🤣 huh? 1000 deaths? 150?
1315	201607	Got my COVID-19 booster shot just now. Let’s get this pandemic over with. Mask up and wash your hands!
1316	106249	@JChengWSJ @YanzhongHuang @Chao_Deng A #Chinese #vaccine to fight the #China originated #coronavirus...any takers?
1317	106166	@KisakumaCosplay Well, we indeed have reasons to think that things will get better in 2021, like the COVID-19 vaccine. But we certainly have to keep pushing if we want things to get better, and not assume it will happen on it's own.
1318	106562	@cspawj @MarthaW19860146 @_JohnBright This is what is going to work when they own up to the vaccine not working. Do you know that there hasn't been a viable vaccine for a coronavirus yet?

1324	105812	@SethAbramson I fear this might become like the flu, where a vaccine won't be wholly effective every year. (Although, based on how they're trying to develop an all-encompassing flu shot, maybe you could do the same if you could tease out the *original* Covid-19 strain.)
1325	105573	It’s the year 2025 and we’re just going into our 16th national lockdown, which they say will definitely see the beginning of the end of this coronavirus. The promised vaccine is just weeks away, again. #Lockdown2 #Covid19UK
1326	105682	Everybody who has a home a car a job align Church person and the less I hope you get the new strain of Coronavirus the vaccine won't work and you have no idea what in it dummy u screwed
1327	106907	If anyone is pissed about being able to get the vaccine they are a dumbass plague rat. Fucking disco ding dong 🤡
1328	105844	"The opposite of ""vaccine escape"" is what allowed us to eventually eradicate smallpox. The smallpox virus most likely originated in gerbils then jumped to us. Coronavirus may work in reverse, preventing eradication."
1329	105246	@PochopPortman @somerays @IanOxford2 Vaccines don’t currently exist in coronavirus family. Period.  All speculations are therefore not science.
1330	201617	Had my 1st dose of COVID-19 vaccine today! Yayy! Okay, now I've got a bit of sore arm but oh well, I'm back home and it's time to write My Sweet Encounter Chapter 7! wohoo! #amwriting #WritingCommunity  #writerslife #TGIF
1331	105513	@SecAzar @JapanEmbDC This is good, but you should be updating the nation about the #coronavirus potential pandemic on an almost hourly basis, considering you are essentially the point-man for handling this disease.   Will there be a worldwide epidemic? Is a vaccine coming? Please inform us!
1332	107397	@AertbyLisa I've had a flu jab each year. A mild cold will permanently worsen my ME/CFS, but a flu jab just makes me a bit worse for a week.They say COVID-19 and the flu are a deadly combination, and the first person to die in Europe was a young man who had both, so I'm getting it again.
1333	201535	@nytimes The night of the Killer Claus!  Santa came down to Georgia!Grandma got run over by a virus!I hear mommy calling 911!All I want for Christmas is my two vaccine shots!Silent Night, Holy Shit!On the 1st day of Christmas my true love gave to me Covid-19
1334	107314	Glad I didn't lose my vaccine card. I feel like everywhere is going to require this for any event in the future!
1335	105740	&lt;what happens if there is no vaccine? hopeful there is, but there is no guarantee or that it will be anymore effective than the seasonal flu shot is preventing the flu&gt;
1336	105773	@BrandonPerna @AdamSchefter Have to wonder how any of these contracts will work out. There isn't going to be an NFL season until there is a COVID-19 vaccine. How can any team sport deal with sick or contagious players that will have to sit for 14 days at a time?
1337	106426	@GavinNewsom The mortality rate is so low. Plus there's a vaccine on deck. We've already flattened the curve once. The Coronavirus is being used for another purpose......Socialism,  Global Reset. Period. All Democrats on board.
1338	105233	Receiving news about someone passing bc of Covid19 (more like, govt negligence) will never be easy. Ingat everyone! If may opportunity offered sa company or LGU for vaccines, pls grab it. Palakasan talaga ng immune system to. Get every protection you can get. Its real.
1339	105693	Wait, but they do? We always said, get the jab if you want, don't force me. When is bodily autonomy acceptable to these people? Only when it's convenient for them?
1340	106707	@DaveKeatley One thing is clear. This is no time to open borders, not until the Chinese Communist Party allows the Wuhan Institute of Virology to release ALL the information about the COVID19 in order to make vaccines fully functional. Right now they are not.
1341	106902	Dear God,Please let this Covid-19 vaccine be the thing that'll wipe out ignorant and stupid people (because they're those who'll refuse to take the vaccine and then later get the virus and die). Amen.
1342	105999	African countries don't want the vaccine, and are doing just fine without it. They've been Big Pharma's guinea pigs before... THEY know...
1343	106174	He downplayed the virus to governors, yet is one of the first the get the vaccine... this country is ass backwards!
1344	105598	Another one to add to the cocktail, truly I will take them all, just mix em up like a Long Island Iced Tea and jab it in!!!
1345	106175	Indeed. Really happy US will donate vaccine to poorer countries where it's desperately needed. And my teenage daughter and I (both US citizens living in Thailand) would love to get vaccinated, but not possible so far. #taxedbutnotvaxxed
1346	107451	My friend once asked me why am I so desperate for the vaccine?This is exactly why. A 20 year old with no medical history just passed away.... I can't afford that
1347	106498	@CalebHowe Don’t y’all see it some kids didn’t get the vaccines and they are just fine like me I never got and never get Covid-19 as well hmm seems to me like the vaccines is the one messing with peoples dna 🧬 and killing them 😮‍💨
1348	105948	I’m so confused on why people care about what someone they’ll never come into contact with is doing. Let him not take the vaccine or take it. The science on BOTH sides has relative pros and cons.This shaming shit is for weirdos and sheep.
1349	107103	@anthonyfurey :  as you know, there is nothing scientific about this.Either we believe in the vaccines, or we don't.@erinotoole ánd @fordnation are perpetuating unscientific fear.The new variant is more transmissible, but more mild = borders should remain open.
1350	106410	@ProfAdeeba University of Oxford researchers have begun testing a COVID-19 vaccine in human volunteers in Oxford today. Around 1,110 people will take part in the trial, half receiving the vaccine and the other half (the control group) receiving a widely available meningitis vaccine.
1351	105659	"@emmaogreen Vaccines are NOT 100% effective.MIllions in the U.S. REFUSE to take the vaccine.Kids under 16 aren't vaxxed yet. Kids spread the virus just like everyone else. There is no longer the ""virus"" but COVID-19 and its many mutations.So yeah, I'm still wearing a mask."
1352	105569	Sure, they have a vaccine for the coronavirus, but you know what they'll never inocculate me against? Being 120% pure class 👏👏👏👏👏👏
1353	105929	@epoch_hollycene @BLM06892246 @trevormwills @h3h3productions Coronavirus isn’t new, it pretty much mutates constantly. This vaccine has been in the making since the first major SARS-Cov outbreak in the early 2000’s. The cervical cancer prevention vaccines and an mRNA vaccine are completely different.
1354	106845	I don't understand why it's become so difficult in my area to be tested for coronavirus. Kinda lame. Proof of antibodies should equal vaxxed or a negative result.
1355	107120	You are like this coronavirus for my heart, infected me badly..no medicines, no vaccine! I hope my future husband is reading this, pls come into my life asap and save me !
1356	106810	The COVID-19 vaccine should be tested on @OfficialPDPNig members first . If they survive the vaccine is safe , if they don't NIGERIA  is safe.  Thank you all .
1357	105632	“This is a good day for me and for my family. The vaccine will help protect me now, especially after my second shot. We will all still follow #COVID19 measures, but I think the vaccine is the most important solution to the pandemic. We will all feel a little safer today onwards”.
1358	107008	Erm.....ugh..... this data..... nothing important is it? @MattHancock - just the amount of people who have died from the vaccine.....but this is a govt who don’t like to provide statistics in any shape or form no matter how many times they are asked! @SirGrahamBrady @JuliaHB1
1359	106091	@shawnmicallef I know you know this:There has never been a successful vaccine for a coronavirus.Ever.
1360	105976	@detroitnews Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
1361	106405	@RealYeyoZa I’m seeing others saying there has never been a coronavirus vaccine, so there might never be one. Any truth to that?
1362	105600	@newsmax We have these vaccinated folks saying, They hope the other folks who don't want to get this COVID-19 vaccine die. And that's never happened before with any of those other vaccines we have out there.

1364	106050	Do we think that God has given us access to the vaccine first because he knows our leadership won't protect us?
1365	107395	"""This is precious vaccine. We do not want to create any security risks,"" Julie Willems Van Dijk of @DHSWI said.""The less we talk about where the vaccine is, the more secure it will be."""
1366	105964	@SamShaneKFBK @C_Mendonsa Sen. Wicker said there’s only one reason for countries to pursue gain of function. That’s nonsense. The US does it &amp; not all reasons are nefarious: Vaccine research, genetic research, etc. The common cold in fat is a coronavirus with no cure or vaccine.
1367	107167	Don't be naive. So what if it is approved by FDA? It doesn't change the fact that the vaccine is not safe. Do not think that the government has your best interest in mind.
1368	201509	omg i did the covid19 booster yesterday im not okay rn my arms hurt a lot like if someone is continuously punching my arm and I feel reeeeeaaaally lazy and tired
1369	105879	No vaccine for me! They have reverse actions, flu shot got me the flu was sick for 3 weeks. If I get it I’ll take the therapeutics.
1370	106480	@POTUS What gives @Twitter @twittersupport ? Why allow all this constant misinformation regarding Covid-19 vaccinations??? It is an indisputable fact that vaccines CANNOT ensure that you don't get the mutating virus, same as the flu...so why allow all the lies?? F'ing disgusting...
1371	105209	We might be getting the vaccines??? A big win. Please get them from Ramaphosa’s country and please adopt the system and protocols they have to acquire it.
1372	105497	Same With COVID-19 Vaccines :-) They truly Work and they set us free to enjoy life again :-)  a mask is a small price to pay , for Freedom , Don't you Think ??
1373	107660	@osquare78 @channelstv My brother everybody is not covid-19 vaccine compliant. It's not by force to take the vaccine. So if you deemed it fit to do so, fine no need insulting people who don't want to take it. It's a free world. Why It's so hard for some people to drive home their points without insults
1374	107373	I am still scared to take the #coronavirus vaccine. My family and friends are taking #ivermectin and we have seen the power in my grandfather. He is cured from #covid! #ivermectinworks

1376	106487	This is how they will get around a mandatory vaccine. Cut funding from anyone the doesn’t require it 😡
1377	107566	@RealKidPoker To research vaccines and treatments for all known viruses, now the coronavirus is a large family but rechearching and creating vaccines would've been paramount. And create tons of masks for doctors and stockpile them for when these things happen because we've got a mass shortage.

1379	106806	@MadFckingWitch @davidsmosspiggy Article pulls a few negative quotes from several researchers to paint a gloomy picture. The reality is 1) The odds of a viable vaccine are good, 2) No coronavirus until this one has been able to infect the lower lungs, so comparing to prev. CVs is unhelpful.
1380	107534	But when it comes to vaccine distribution it is still unclear on equal distribution once health care workers done.  Make these in Usa in bulk and distribute as immunity only last less than 6 months @vivek_murthy
1381	106619	It would be a real shame if all these political leaders and celebrities that are getting recorded taking the vaccine are actually getting an empty syringe to trick the masses....
1382	106598	@coldo71369284 @HagemasterBeth @realDonaldTrump Same goes for the coronavirus; why do you think so many politicians that said the virus is a hoax but yet they are first in line to get the vaccine?  And why are so many non-believers wearing masks (most improperly or never cleaning it)...
1383	106779	@glenzee79 @CNN @StCollinson (The first coronavirus vaccine in history, the vaccine being rolled out, is because of Trump admin, and was completed in 6 months)Orange man bad
1384	105223	@aldatweets @ohdannyboy12 the vaccine does not prevent people from getting coronavirus or spreading it. (it does other things.) every single person being vaccinated (which I am btw) would not 100% wipe out coronavirus. these tweets are tiresome.
1385	106603	Can someone explain why we keep calling it a #COVID19 #vaccine?? Vaccines provide IMMUNITY to a virus. These are shots to BOOST our immune system,  they do NOT make you immune!! I still think we should all get the shots, but I think we should be honest in what it does!
1386	107087	I don’t know what they put In vaccines , but I thought they put the virus in them Coronavirus is common, it’s just the strain we look at , correct?Do the ppl that are being tested and have had a positive result also have had  the flu vaccine?
1387	107505	@KurtBusch just heard it suggested on MSNBC that NASCAR drivers (and other athletes) get the Coronavirus vaccine to ramp up the trust of the skeptics in the country. Sounds good to me! Hope you are getting yours soon!!  ❤️🦋❤️🇺🇸🏁
1388	107214	How have they been testing the new coronavirus vaccines? Has anyone who has gotten the vaccine been exposed to the live virus or is the effectiveness all hypothetical?
1389	106265	Every day of my life, senior citizens call me desperate to get the vaccine. I’ve even had veterans call me. Seems to me that you would give these 40 shots to an American who actually loves our country not a terrorist. #comeonman

1393	105501	Now you have my attention 😏Seriously though, if I was going to get a shot that would do nothing for me, there are much worse reasons than free beer.  I got 6 rounds of Anthrax vaccine in the Marines and usually had to come up with my own beer and entertainment...
1394	107227	@CornerRadish @therealmissjo @jon_mumford1982 You give no reason, that's unhelpful.There is no cure for coronavirus-19, until a vaccine is developed.An apparently healthy can carry the virus for upto 27 days before symptoms show.During that incubation period an infected person infects others.Isolation is the only defense

1400	106644	@MeghanMcCain People just don’t understand how serious the coronavirus is until it hits their family. The question is why are we getting the vaccine? Trump created some of the problems. He didn’t wear a mask  for a long time. People need to stop criticizing you and do some research.

1409	105952	exactly. what y’all gotta say now? it’s YOUR CHOICE but i HIGHLY recommend getting the vaccine not only to protect you but someone you love as well. be smart.

1414	106521	@VinGuptaMD I'd like to know (esp in respect to the immune system), approx number of those who died of covid19 had not had a flu shot in the autumn. Pneumonia vaccines, esp for the elderly? Flu shots come out in September now, and even w/out Covid in them, they help me resist flu
1415	105473	Totally agreed. Testing is the only way out! The WHO has said that even previous infection wont protect you from reinfection, which means even if a vaccine comes, it may only prevent serious infections and not an infection itself.

COVID19 isn't going away easily but changes in our behavior can prevent it or manage it if we have it. Other countries can do it...why not the US, too much freedom, opinion, laziness or stupidity?
1426	105657	@Spacedementia87 @davidwhitaker40 @mountainecology @10DowningStreet 1) Do you genuinely believe 100,000 people signed up as volunteers? 2) it usually takes 12-15 years minimum to get a vaccine approved?3) no institute has found a coronavirus vaccine in 20/25 years yet we do in 6 months? Sorry it’s 98.54% in the U.K. think that’s high enough
1427	106383	How did healthy, under-65, non-healthcare-workers family got COVID-19 vaccine so soon? They got a tip and used it. Didn't contact any compromised or elderly people or healthcare workers in their family, friend group, neighborhood, kids school.
1428	107071	@NBCLX My great grandma in Newburgh NY got the vaccine, fell broke her hip, and contracted coronavirus/ COVID19 at the physical therapy clinic. YOU TELL ME HOW EFFECTIVE THIS VACCINE IS WHEN THE POEPLE AROUND ME ARE STILL GETTING BADLY SICK 💔
1429	105464	What q shame this this, meanwhile countries around the world have noneThis reminds me like the gun issue, when there is a mass shooting like at a school, outrage abound and after a month everyone forgets and carry on, vaccines are like a news cycle, human behaviour is weird
1430	107117	Has there been any forgery of the COVID-19 vaccine cards? Or is that not an issue yet as they're not yet widely the permission slip back into normal activities?
1431	105665	All those who died of Covid got the flu vaccine this year. Is it because they had compromised immune systems?Or is it something more sinister? All nursing home patients get vaccinated. Why did 5 Dem govs keep Covid patients in nursing homes? 🤔#Plandemic #ArrestBillGates
1432	106616	It's 2021 there is a vaccine for coronavirus, DeSantis is impeached, and an executive order is signed to replace the mile to mandatory participation in Kanye's New Workout Plan
1433	107601	@CollignonPeter In Italy I learn about twenty, thirty and forty year olds who lose their lives due to covid19. I would really like to know if the disease is really cured as they say or if it is fatal. I am not interested in ideologies. The only way to save is the vaccine yes or no?

They’ll have a hand in a vaccine that everyone will willfully take to be rid of coronavirus fears, but it will secretly microchip them, allowing Gates and Co. to track everyone.
1435	107349	Over the last few months, if asked whether I would receive a coronavirus vaccine, my reaction has been yes. But then, I've thought...well, that depends. It depends on what we hear about this vaccine, the approval process, etc. News like this is good to see.
1436	106423	@XylariaVG purposefully inject this man with coronavirus, and tell him he can only get the vaccine if he delivers on these promises
1437	107414	"@thehill ""...the Democrats don't want a vaccine either! They want Americans to die from the Coronavirus!! Not like me, when I ignored it for months, and called it a Democra... oh shit, forget that!"""
1438	201625	All well-informed people know that this is possible - significant protection only *starts* 12 days after the first vaccine dose. The well-known 95% effective rate is only some time after the *second* dose. My reaction to this and news of a few allergic reactions: who cares?
1439	106307	My only regret about getting 2nd COVID-19 vaccine shot is I went there a lil early, so instead of having an excuse to get a nice sandwich for lunch at a place I like near there, I got a dynamite omelet earlier instead.Also I’m not yet functioning very well as a 5G cell tower.
1440	107132	If the vaccine works then those the want to be protect it OK and my refusal should not matter because those that worried are safe. does this answer your question
1441	105435	So only two outcomes from #COVID19 1Vaccine 2You're antibody test proves your body can fight the virus. Going out is a risk we cant gamble with, the vaccine is risk I will not be so comfortable with accepting. Question everything. #coronavirus
1442	201636	@shiftms Rest,rest and more rest!!! My fatigue has been pretty extreme the last couple of days! And if I didn’t have to get my 1st Covid-19 vaccine tomorrow, I would stay in bed all day! But I am so fortunate to be able to get this vaccine I will crawl to the Doctors office to get it!
1443	106884	@steveubl When you actually come up with a vaccine for the common cold (which is a coronavirus) maybe I'll possibly slightly remotely consider getting a cv-19 vaccine
1444	201541	I just got my first shot of the Pfizer vaccine today at State Farm Stadium. They have an excellent system working there. Hurray!!! 🎊🎉💉
1445	105939	@charliekirk11 Anti vaccine a-holes are going to be why we don’t beat COVID-19 when we currently have the resources to do so.
1446	105787	@AaronBosterMD @YouTube Thank you for posting. I will be telling my doctors when I get vaccinated, but are there projects ongoing to track MS patients and COVID-19 or vaccines? I'm signed up with Narcoms study, will have my 2nd yearly follow up in 3 months. Any others we should look for?
1447	105886	So, basically, the jab might not actually do much except protect people who don't need protecting and Covid is mainly affecting people with preexisting conditions, like we've known for 18 months now. If this is true then many people are going to jail for a £1 trillion fraud
1448	105265	Not surprising. He's in with Gates' NWO POPULATION CONTROL VACCINE SCAM. Killing people like the elderly in the Nursing homes is  in their wheelhouse
1449	106766	What will parents do if the government mandates the COVID-19 vaccine for children returning to school.  I bet it would create the biggest uproar in history.  Nearly 5000 people have DIED after taking this vaccine.  One kid does and it is game over.
1450	107409	@larssivertsen And he’s been getting into anti-vaccine David Icke, 5g coronavirus conspiracy nonsense recently, so he’s seemingly only getting less intelligent
1451	105273	My mom received the vaccine the day it became available in Virginia. She’s a respiratory therapist. Even as a teacher, I don’t need this vaccine to do my job at the moment.
1452	107550	people would probably take a vaccine for the wuhan virus yet not for the flu. People are so so strange
1453	105881	@oOoMzPiinkoOo @VLEXXXGALINDO That’s a very wrong and dangerous mentality. The coronavirus, yes has been around for awhile but the particular strain HAS NOT. Hence why there is no vaccine or cure for it, therefore we MUST take precautions and STAY home to prevent further spread. Stop underestimating it.
1454	107564	This virus is spreading way too rapidly. Can anyone reply to this tweet with any databases on the infection? #coronavirus #coronavaccine
1455	107579	@realDonaldTrump I wasn’t allowed to say anything until today, but it's now done so.... I volunteered for the test phase of COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer. This vaccine is the one that has been developed in Russia. It is administered in 6 different stages and I received my first...
1456	107272	@KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Somebody needs to tell Rand Paul to take a flying leap.  He isn't a doctor, he isn't a scientist so he has no business telling people not wear masks if they've had Covid-19 or if you had the vaccine.  Let the doctors and scientist do their job. They don't try and do yours
1457	107661	2 weeks after the election, Moderna announces their vaccine is 95% effective. How long did they know? How long did they delay the announcement to hurt @realDonaldTrump just like Pfizer? I bet Tony Fauci knows. These are his pals. Proof that Big Pharma doesn't care about YOU.
1458	201716	148,000 Nigerians have so far received their second dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. — @drfaisalshuaib (June 3, 2021)
1459	106222	@ianbrown The vaccines for various coronavirus types such as seasonal flu and CV19 are similar. Never any evidence or reason to think that they can cause infertility.
1460	105868	@discipleheart1 It's not what I think it's what I know. This is not a fully approved vaccine, we are going through phase 2 and 3 using the American population. As they push the 'safe' vaccine relentlessly on doctor radio in the same breath they tell us they know very little about covid19
1461	106014	#Unvaccinated #vaccine #vaccinated #VaccinePassports #Covid_19 #coronavirus #VaccineMandate This is why- because the 2 shot vaccine did its job- (people can't think for themselves- they will do what they are told) this is a side effect from the vaccine #VaccineSideEffects
1462	105584	@AdamBode4 @MsMelChen @PeterDrew There has never been a successful coronavirus vaccine in 50+ years of research specifically because they mutate so much--using non-sterilizing treatments in mass only drives mutants thru selective pressure and will lead to immune escape.  Vax the elderly/immune compromised.
1463	106999	This is what #JoeBiden doesn't say about the vaccine....that people are still getting the #coronavirus even after getting the vaccine.
1464	201512	Sorry my body is a temple of the Lord's..it is not mine...Thus taking a #vaccine goes against my #Christian values...I also can't believe or spread a lielike covid and it's numbers#wakeup#WakeUpAmerica
1465	107432	@RichmondWahoo @diogeron @NewsHour James covid-19 IS SARS-COV-2. It was called that bc it is similar (not the same) to SARS-COV. It's a new virus that belongs to the coronavirus fam. The vaccines work so well bc they were created using existing techniques for covid-19. You take YOUR misinformation out of here.
1466	106333	absolutely blows my mind that there are people in my family who are proud about deciding not to get the covid-19 vaccine
1467	107320	What we need is a vaccine against COVID-19 cause we are going to be living with this shit. And the sad thing is everyone is going to get this shit one way or the other sighs 🤦🏽‍♂️
1468	105259	How can you find a business for not being able to use all of their COVID vaccine? Maybe people just don’t want it?Or are they desperate for us to get it?
1469	107031	@Lancegooden Lance Gooden,You are going to cry regardless if it is too high or low.America is having problems because of the Covid-19 variant is causing manning shortages throughout the United States. 🇺🇸 It would nice 👍 if all Americans would get the Covid vaccine without being told.
1470	107543	@WilliamPesek The whole world is going down with vaccines or not. Covid-19 will become endemic, and we can't stop it.
1471	105249	"@koreatimescokr *new* Coronavirus? So, it's #Covid20 in #Korea ? Not ""re-infected"" but ""re-activated"". Does the virus lay dormant then re-activate, until a vaccine is found to kill it? @WHO @normanswan #FactCheck"
1472	107022	@PheenixRiseeng Quick question, if I die from coronavirus will it protect me against getting cancer 🤷‍♀️PS. I got cancer way before I got my vaccine so I’m not sure who’s winning here but I think it’s not your SiL 😬😆
1473	107260	Why are so many people without a mask on and there is no vaccine omg I’m gonna catch Coronavirus I just know it and if I have to die a painful death because of you bitches I’m coming back haunting you with a vengeance
1474	106187	I live in PA; am 74.  My grandchildren who attend school in person, live with us. My husband is 77.  He works outside the home. we have no idea when we will get the vaccine.  Communication from health services is sorely lacking.  Friends all over the country have received theirs!
1475	106003	No way is this clown getting that vaccine. They're trying really hard to convince us these vaccines are safe. I've never seen him with a mask on. Is it really even  him? And why turn off the replies?
1476	201550	Had my 2nd vaccine. Sore heavy arm. Bit cold n shaky, icy toes, hot face. Just uncomfy. Better than Covid 19!Took 2 paracetamol (Tylenol).  Worked a treat.A public service announcement.Have the vaccine.Paracetamol is a fab drug in the right circumstances#vaccine #COVID19
1477	106046	Y’all wanna encourage Americans to get the #Covid19 #Vaccine? Then stop showing me @marcorubio getting the vaccine and start showing me @DollyParton getting it. She deserves it before anyone else.

1480	106648	Keep doing good work @GautamGambhir.... And...to clarify, he is not procuring #COVID19 #vaccine. He is going to pay hospitals and arrange it for common citizens.
1481	106804	It's tactical. So are the premature state openings. They are gambling that Biden will be successful with the vaccine- they will then pivot, point to the early openings, and claim the stimulus was an unneeded massive addition to the deficit. They will do this. It's who they are.
1482	105893	"""It features American figures such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent anti-vaccine campaigner, who in August addressed a massive rally in Berlin against coronavirus measures. The crowd included vaccine skeptics, conspiracy theorists and far-right groups, among others."""
1483	201750	Coronavirus vaccine: launches@MKBHD : so I've been using this vaccine for the last few weeks and here are my thoughts
1484	107488	@apoorva_nyc It is a Novel Coronavirus originated from animals &amp; nobody is immune to it. Kids aren't affected that much but they can spread it to others.Definitely not a man-made virus.Masks,hand-hygiene &amp; social distancing can prevent it.Can get proper immunity only through a vaccine.
1485	106816	@svallers @droverdriver61 Also they were working on the vaccines before covid, this isn't our first coronavirus.
1486	107381	SCIENTISTS got us the COVID19 vaccine...Trump can't make the vaccine. Trump is not a scientist. Simply put...   .... you can make all the calls you want, but without the scientists and the science...there would be NO vaccines.
1487	105230	@RT_com Screw you Bill Gates The day I take medical advice off a software engineer is the day I take my phone to my local doctor to get repaired. Since I do neither you can push your stupid vaccine agenda elsewhere.#BillGates #scamdemic2020 #COVID19
1488	106899	@Independent Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines.

1489	105260	@DHSCgovuk @DrJennersHouse I’d disagree... magically finding, producing a vaccine for a novel Coronavirus is... totes amazing all done in 8 months 🤔
1490	105686	Dude...I sadly know the feeling. One is half and half about getting the vaccine, the other doesn’t want to. I’ve had similar conversations too. Hope it all works out for you, man.

1494	105469	@LifeWithJohn You said you were getting a coronavirus vaccine last time, did you get it? How did you feel after you got hit?
1495	106614	@anandmahindra Good news sir, Oxford vaccine strengthen white blood cell and immune system so protection not only from coronavirus but other viruses bacteria attack.
1496	106783	@JCavallo972 @fcraska30 @HotlineJosh Real question for you. If he already had COVID19 why get the shot? And not just a booster later on like we may need? What am I missing about how vaccines work? Vaccines give you a controlled amount to create an immune response for your body to create antibodies.

Its truly terrifying to think about when they go epidemic. Im so grateful were dealing with a coronavirus and not influenza virus! Much better chances of vaccine efficacy.
1501	107366	@kallman_tom How many people who've tested positive for Covid-19 with no symptoms. Got a bad test, and are really negative? Then needed more tests? My God the number could be astronomical! Keeping us locked down for nothing. So now, I ask... how in the hell can they make a vaccine? #Lies4U
1502	107104	@Teensthack Indian vaccine is completely safe and above 80% efficacy. We don't need other countries vaccine. E.U trying hard to sell their vaccine. Hence stoping indian vaccine. Everything business. US China's big top companies and vaccine sellers both are behind this covid19 spread.
1503	106206	@commonsnspoli @CNN Covid 19, like any other coronavirus can never go away until herd immunity achieved. Period. That’s it. Please educate yourself. No deadly virus has ever gone away without herd immunity and/or a vaccine, or drastic mutation to bring less deadly.
1504	105207	Vaccines are helping us all get our lives back, but I've seen all sorts of misinformation since they've become available. Confronting fear with facts is how we overcome vaccine hesitancy. Dr. Walensky has the answers to your questions about the COVID vaccine ⬇
1505	105849	Hope scientists come up with the vaccine for COVID-19 asap. Perhaps now scientists would get more grants and funds for R&amp;D.

1507	107673	@PhilLatham @PaulWoldfarm In the last 12 weeks life's changed immeasurably the grim reality is that coronavirus is here with us for the foreseeable future.

1524	107152	@poiThePoi @jonst0kes Sure. Long odds, probably. Though I worry that this is the first time we tried a coronavirus vaccine - and we did it in a rush. Why was there no vaccine after SARS or MERS?
1525	201643	DONE with my pneumonia vaccine today. And THANK YOU so much to my hub for the generousity. I only have 3 tablets (Isoniazid) left and can't dropby sa pharmacy.

1530	106224	Pretty much this. Considering recent finds, I'm pretty optimistic on a coronavirus vaccine. That said, I don't think it'll be very effective, we'll probably need multiple doses, and I'm not sure everyone will be able to get one (children or the old may have immune issues).
1531	201709	I don’t feel well, my upper arm is very sore and hot. I have a neck-ache and headache, taken some paracetamol. #covid19 #vaccine

1533	105918	@DaniBat Oh just the fact that the hemp plants / marijuana were studied long before the COVID-19 vaccines were ever thought of. Then again, I get how you may not know that when you’re a delusional leftist who doesn’t live in reality. #1984
1534	107020	@WayneDupreeShow Hell no. If we can get a coronavirus vaccine in a year why isn't there one for SARS or MERS yet?
1535	106021	Not unless there is a variant that both enjoys heat and is impervious to the vaccine.Are we still listenng to Imperial? And what figure did they quote?
1536	105595	Kind of figured that the project would be delayed. They're still using the old Macy's as a central vaccine/testing site in the city. Nothing's going to happen until they get a new, permanent solution to those needs.
1537	201634	I got my first COVID-19 vaccine today. I nearly cried from relief when the nurse injected me. #FauciOuchie #Moderna #thankyouJesusandDollyParton #theonlycoronaiwantisbeer
1538	107211	@Dan_GT2 They would soon get the shot. I think after all of this everyone who wants to experience things need to have a vaccination card for Covid-19 to do things. No vaccine your going to have a rough time like let's say flying, getting into certain places where crowds are big and close.

1543	106950	Considering these vaccines will have very unpleasant side effects, I think this is an excellent idea.
1544	107070	@Aflame4Truth So just let the elderly die if COVID-19 than risk a probably safe vaccine. You apparently don’t have an over 70 loved one.  In the over 5% mortality crowd the benefits far outweigh any known risks. Decisions out of fear rarely work out well. Don’t give it to under 40 crowd.
1545	107351	We all need to work together to protect the world from #COVID19 and the May 4 pledging conference must be a success. Will @g20org states please step up and release much needed funds for response efforts to @WHO @CEPIvaccines and @gavi? Together, we can beat this pandemic.
1546	106420	As someone in a vulnerable population who’s trying to self-isolate until there’s a vaccine, let me just say you couldn’t pay me enough to get this one.
1547	107005	@BobSteele55 You have waited this long Bob due to covid-19 so another week is nothing you will smash it m8.The vaccine is now opening up all operations andci notice my oncology unit getting a lot busier which is brilliant.👍👍🙏🙏🙏🙏🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
1548	107168	I’m all about people choosing what they want but if you choose to not get the vaccine please don’t let the reason be because HE said not to 😂😂😂
1549	107198	"SO @realDonaldTrump WE REALLY NEED FOR THE FAUSI AND Birx AND ALL WHO HAS A STAKE IN THE ""VACCINES/ TREATMENTS/MASK"" NEED TO PUBLICLY EXPLAIN THIS BULL B/C WE'RE SICK BEING PLAYED LIKE CHESS PIECES. WE DON'T TRUST ANY ONE IN GOVERNMENT OR THE MEDICAL PROFESSION."
1550	106971	@JennyGerrard4 @Luan89310204 @RapoportAnatoli @KayaJones And the milllions and millions who ALREADY had Covid-19 will never get Covid-19 again.   Their bodies made their own antibodies against Covid-191000% better than any vaccine! They can’t get it again therefore, cannot spread it!
1551	107230	@davidicke Simple, because people get infected by flu again and again year after year and flu vaccine has to be taken every year then any #coronavirus vaccine will not be a once in a life time vaccine but a yearly vaccine just as the case with flu.
1552	107572	And How Would You Stop a Pandemic From Spreading . When The People Are To Selfish And Stupid To Do The Right Thing Like NSW. Victoria Had It BeatOur Brain Dead PM has Disappeared as Usual.With No Vaccine Ordered.?
1553	105615	They will milk everyone that has taken those vaccines for life.You all will keep renewing shots every year. 😂
1554	106191	@cnn The world is still waiting for a vaccine for other viruses with no cure like HIV and HSV...how is COVID-19 any different? And how optimistic is the development of this vaccine? #CNNTownHall
1555	106022	COVID-19 vaccine I wanted to get it right away. I would argue and argue with my mother and beg her to let me get vaccinated, but she kept on saying no. Later to find out why I wouldn’t be getting to vaccine because of my arthritis. My mother had talked to my doctor and they said
1556	106243	@cafe_health I predicted politicians such as Governors would start trying to prove that the coronavirus vaccine is safe by having saline injected. There's no way in hell they are really getting a vaccine
1557	105254	@DrOtterman Flu is 40-60% and typhoid for another eg is 72%However there is precedent with other vaccines, such as Polio, Smallpox (eliminated) Measles, Mumps, Rubella (97% effective)We know this Coronavirus is different from one which causes flu so that could be why it's more effective
1558	106612	@toxdom I can't think of any coronavirus vaccines, but there may be some. However, an antibody is super specific. If you tested another coronavirus vaccine against CV-19, it would not be able to help show efficacy. It's like having 2 gold keys, each will only fit the lock it belongs to.
1559	106799	Our very own Dr. Greenberg discussing a Dermatologic reaction to the Covid vaccine- if you think you have a post vaccine reach out- info@lvderm.com #dermatology #vegas #drvegas
1560	201678	In addition, I electronically contacted the usual local ‘county’ COVID-19 vaccine medical delivery providers...My actual COVID-19 vaccine scheduling question is this;If (as an individual), I have to concurrently ‘register’ with a distributed (50) vaccine provider resources.
1561	201695	Fully vaxxed and back in the office. Feeling a bit like a feral child raised by wolves reintroduced to civilization and Eliza Doolittle with a bunch of rocks in my mouth.#COVID19
1562	201589	Second Covid19 vaccine done. I also died my hair red on guidance from my five year old https://t.co/Qk2rfeU6qI
1563	105488	Serious question and bit of conspiracy theory -  what if there is something in the vaccine that will prevent exposure to the next virus they are planning?  What if not taking the vaccine exposes us to something worse?
1564	105276	I’m so confused how it’s not clear that the vaccine isn’t the answer omg haha how is this supposed to make you get it???
1565	106120	My liberal friends are often asking “Why did we get vaxxed? We are still getting it and passing it and it’s MORPHING and we are all miserable.” Coronavirus has better survival instincts than modern man.
1566	105537	@CNN If successful, this will be the first successful coronavirus vaccine in the sixty years since coronaviruses were found in humans.
1567	106473	"So Astra Zeneca is only revealing what "" they think""  happened in their #COVID19 vaccine, stopping volunteer human clinical trials.  Well it's pretty serious  👉 Transverse myelitis interrupts the messages that the spinal cord nerves send throughout the body.👈"
1568	107113	Where does he think the work force is going to come from if these people don’t get their jabs? What a fucking cock. #RIPNHS
1569	106262	@karynmaughan Lockdown does not kill the virus. It is going to run its cause anyway. After years and years, still no vaccine for any coronavirus exist. Self-quarantine and let the rest work.
1570	106303	In fact, there is no guarantee that we will be able to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus in the immediate future.#کام_کو_چلو_کورونا_سے_بچو
1571	201582	"I am so glad Eubi!  So glad. I hope when we are old and rich, we will laugh about how we had Covid19 at the same time. My symptoms were SO mild, it felt more like a ""sneezing fit."" Thanks to vaccine I took whilst travelling a few weeks prior. But for you, timing was everything!👏"
1572	106678	If it was actually a vaccine it would kill the virus and prevent future illness,  but it doesn't so it's just a treatment option?
1573	107671	@NishiwakiRina #unpeconJapan should be able to get the vaccine not only by doctors but also by volunteers like the United Kingdom.  If this happens, the vaccine intake rate will increase, and the tourism industry will become as active as it did before the coronavirus.
1574	106169	@kimmibaby1989 @Josiestweet Really don’t get why post articles like this as reason not to get the vaccine. Millions have died from getting coronavirus, yet you focus on the two articles you can find of people dying after having the vaccine? Millions of deaths vs. a few deaths, tough call for sure ⚖️🙄
1575	107526	@pfizer and @moderna_tx Anti-Vaxers. Once distribution of the covid-19 vaccine gets distributed. You get a free airline ticket to North Dokota where they literally... and I’m not joking elected a dead person as their representative.
1576	106778	Sounds like this school probably doesn’t mandate wearing masks. But the vaccine harms those who are “in close proximity”. 🤨
1577	106847	@DrHugoA @MHRAgovuk @RBandH @ImperialNHLI @bengoldacre @DoctorChristian @doctor_oxford @DrRayBakes @drphilhammond @xandvt @DoctorChrisVT @drphiliplee1 @mgtmccartney I will take any approved coronavirus vaccine.I'm not a doctor but 3 of my children are.I'm a lawyer. I trust the science.
1578	106097	crazy this is why we listen to scientists.. but also they could’ve stopped it they knew it was mutating and no one thought hey maybe this needs a vaccine
1579	105664	@jonatanpallesen Gates is OK to me but why the focus on him? Aside from the Coronavirus vaccine conspiracy stuff then he is a pretty typical misguided philanthropist.
1580	106360	▶️China has made key progress in scientific research. To date, four inactivated vaccines and one adenovirus vaccine have been approved for clinical trials. ▶️Once Covid-19 vaccine is developed and deployed in China, it will be used as a global public product.
1581	105666	So let me get this straight. Fact: Bill wants to depop the world. He is creating a vaccine and wants to give it to Black Americans first? Black Americans are leaving the Dems in droves. What a convenient way to get rid of the problem...
1582	106413	@TerraB717 Covid-19 and all their vaccines are nothing but poison to American citizens if you are Muslim you don't have to get the shot I am Muslim today I'm not getting a shot!!🇺🇸
1583	106837	How about a holiday in #EUROPE? Or the #EC part of it, once they've got the #Covid19 Vaccine sent out to all countries. Still squabbling like Le Rats dans le Sac.   #bbcAQ
1584	106393	what if bill gates is turning everyone into 5g towers with the coronavirus vaccine that george soros is paying for
1585	201757	My dad had his first Covid-19 jab today. It feels a little like the light at the end of the tunnel is drawing a bit closer. https://t.co/9pwMNtY8uH
1586	107633	Greater then 70 percent population is vaccinated they check vaccine passes  in all taxi restaurants attractions Time with peace This is the way #COVID19
1587	106149	@ProviderOfTruth @archdelux1 @NPR_junky @CNN This is a new strain just like you said. There’s no vaccine and scientists don’t even know much about the virus. Just because it’s on a Lysol can has nothing to do with what we know and how we handle it. Nobody’s ever had Covid-19 until it hit downplaying it doesn’t make it leave
1588	105718	The vaccine should be tested on politicians first. If they survive, the vaccine is safe. If they don't, then the country is safe.#covid19
1589	106034	Lagos is still topping the CORONAVIRUS League. The super four LAGOS, GOMBE, OYO and DELTA will enter CHAMPIONSHIP LEAGUE FINAL. Besides, where is KANO in this list? 42,922 cases discharged without any vaccine. How and what treatment did they take? #COVID19Nigeria is a hoax
1590	106578	@JohnCLibert5 @washingtonpost Ron is not requiring you to fear evil but when you don’t get a bed space in the ICU, you would realize then that you’re lost in the  valley of Covid-19 with no ladder (vaccine) to get out
1591	105490	@JustinTrudeau Tested positive for #COVID19 after 3 jabs!  Really? You think everyone is rushing to get their #vaccines now?  You sure are stupid.  Another excuse to not deal with the #TruckersConvoy2022 That’s ok, they’ll wait for you!
1592	105509	Y’all realize the common cold is a coronavirus? And there is no cure or vaccination for it? So don’t get your hopes up about a cure or vaccine.
1593	105842	@realDonaldTrump The only thing u ever did for vaccines is say, “We should develop a vaccine.”  You thought “a solid flu vaccine” would prevent Coronavirus.
1594	105354	The WHO is responsible for covering up the discovery that virus = exosome. They shut down proffessor Duesberg and Kary Mullis for it. They tampered with research to be able to use poison in vaccine on all like done in 1918 by Frederick T Gates !
1595	107497	#HistroicalArchive  #covid19 I don't even know where the herd immunity carp started with this virus. We use the term for vaccines but never illness itself. Plus you can get #coronavirus more than once so it's pointless anyway. Not to mention unethical.
1596	106945	Dear Fox PunditsThe vaccine was developed based on the 1st Covid-19 not the mutations since. So it’s efficacy will obviously be lower. We should be grateful it’s as good as it is. But keep spewing garbage so we get a vaccine resistant strain and do it all over againK thx
1597	106750	@Daring_Idiot @NeilSheesley @andyd522 @DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump So it is ok for the idiot to call it the china virus?  Kind of two way on that one.  We are all aware it is the covid 19 and that the vaccine was done quickly because they had the laywork already done for the coronavirus.  Not because the orange baffoon did anything.
1598	105277	On day one of the #MorrisonLockdown, Victoria does itself proud with amazing testing numbers!And vaccination numbers are up, too! Go you beauty, because this is how we not just trample the virus, but stamp it out! If you can, please organise your jab.#COVID19Vic #COVID19Aus
1599	105408	Ndp on #cp24 telling everyone this new variant is extremely contagious and deadly .... same channel , doctors telling us “we don’t know enough” lockdown for Xmas people. How’s that vaccine working out for ya ? #covid19
1600	201675	Guess who just booked the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine??!!! Tomorrow at 9:30 ... I'm getting the shot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1601	107518	@ChuckCallesto I feel we will be forced to take the Covid-19 vaccine for everyone’s benefit just like we are being forced to wear masks for everyone’s benefit.
1602	105426	There have been many attempts to make viral vaccines in the past that ended in utter failure, which is why we did not have a coronavirus vaccine in 2020.  In the 1960's, scientists attempted to make an RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) vaccine for infants.
1603	107202	@SiberiaCat3 @Moonie74786922 @centexgrunt @Kelly_K_77 @SquirrelOS @lavern_spicer Not a bot - just reality. Covid-19 will not disappear, even with 100% vaccinations. Plus, no way will 100% be global, and the vaxxed catch/carry. Learning to live with endemic is possible. Figuring out how isn’t being openly discussed. Fearing the pandemic is not productive.
1604	107127	@sechsneuneins @FaheemYounus So why has this methodology not been applied to a vaccine for treating AIDS ,SARS, MERS all viruses,  as deadly, if these hv been proven safe in less then 12 months of testing? AIDS been around 40 years , SARS 19. Covid19, 1 year &amp; there is a fix using a method not deployed b4.
1605	107209	@patriotchick4 @knoone413 @AmirAminiMD This was a, get this, NOVEL coronavirus. There was no way to fight it because it is not the same strain as similar viruses. It is A coronavirus. Not SARS-CoV-2. Which is also why new tests had to be made and there's no vaccine.
1606	105957	@TheM_L_G @ACiderDrink There is a very real drawback of socialized medicine countries they havent made any progress on a vaccine despite having earlier strains of the coronavirus sars being the prominent one which happened over 15 years ago
1607	106092	@EmeraldRobinson whats it like lying about a Virus (COVID19) that has killed 700k Americans, and Lying about the Vaccine,, JUST SO YOU GET A PAY CHECK&lt; whats it like to be the FACE in the Dictionary next to the word Deplorable
1608	106789	@newscomauHQ @mikepompeo How does a virus get from a #WuhanLab to being inside a human? #vaccines. The people of #china were given mandatory vaccines JUST before this all broke out. Then #5G was rolled out adding further #stress to the body and #coronavirus took over. #cellpoisoning💉⚡️#billgates #WHO
1609	201528	40 mins away from having my covid vaccine .... 💪🏼 so scared of needles 😩😩 #COVID19 #CovidVaccine #letsdothis
1610	105821	No really, I give up. I have been fighting to get the world to buy Prevnar and Pneumovax and HPV shots for a decade, and no one in #cdnpoli knew who the F Gavi or @ShotAtLife wasNow suddenly #covid19 comes along and you all know how vaccines get made, ordered and bought
1611	201635	Back from my first Saturday evening out in ages. OK, I took Dad to the health centre for his first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, but it still counts.....
1612	105390	Just because we've got a really good vaccine against polio doesn't mean the same thing will work with coronavirus, because it's so different.
1613	106730	the vaccine against coronavirus is a fraud humanity will have to live with this virus what humanity needs and treatment to not die because with vaccine or without vaccine humanity is dying.
1614	106963	The problem is people come around to wanting the vaccine only AFTER they get sick! Be smart, people! Get it now!!
1615	105289	Morning after #COVID19  vaccine update:- My arm is hecka sore. Much like after the flu shot, I won't be lifting my arm up today.- My brain is foggy and I'm pretty tired. Going up the stairs is tiring and talking extensively is too.
1616	105253	@99freemind @HRHospital There has never been a coronavirus vaccine that ever worked.  Suddenly we are sold two vaccines will save the world.
1617	106043	I actually find nothing wrong with this. Dia cuma utamakan je, like they utamakan front liner. Kita punya turn dpt vaccine memang lambat lagi pun 😂In fact, these people helped SO SO SO many lives before. Dont you think they deserve it?
1618	107361	@msnbc has made it abundantly clear. They do not care at all about people who die from taking the vaccine. @msnbc doesn't employ a single person who values human life.  What terrible human beings.
1619	106861	@KobieThatcher @ShazzaCook @deanandy477 @NSWHealth ... and for the Nay sayer, coronavirus Arte known for not having a vaccine because we never found one against the common cold, however, why not now, why not since our research are becoming worldwide, why not now since it is our primarily focus?
1620	107568	This whole thing, all of it, COVID, Vaccines, Republicans, Election, it is all one big cluster f’ck. I’m going to my corner of the world, done with it all, won’t watch news, I’m going to be one of those people who don’t know shit and are happy as can be. Republicans r a waste....
1621	201526	The jab for #COVID19 is amazing but I’ve had this 24 hour sickness bug for the last 18 hours and don’t understand why we don’t have a jab for this! I feel awful!
1622	107344	Random Saturday thought-it’s amazing to think we got a Covid19 vaccine developed, trialled and partially deployed quicker than the time it took Apple to figure out how to adapt Face ID so that we could unlock our phones whilst masked up 🤔🤔🤔#GetVaccinated
1623	105705	COVID-19 is realMost will develop mild to no symptoms.However, those it does kill, it kills rather quicklyBeing obese is high risk for hospitalization and/or death.The vaccine is probably a good idea for such folks.
1624	106905	@RitaLisaPatton @56Symons @JustinTrudeau @jacindaardern You are either a bot or a very stupid person.  There has never been a vaccine for a.coronavirus ever!  This is a flu bug with a 99.6% recovery rate.  Never a vaccine for SARS or H1N1, and we survived.  You take this vaccine and you will be in a graveyard.
1625	107394	JKL the Kagwe Dilemma. @KoinangeJeff  @citizentvkenya  , In his own words, 'how is the Kenyan vaccine going to work? and how did they know that am going to get covid19? Ama unapewa vaccine na unatumwa penye corona iko?' Just asking.
1626	107369	Feel like a train wreck after receiving my first Pfizer vaccine yesterday. Hopefully, these symptoms will subside quickly and won't be as bad the second time around! Just made me realise how much worse it may be actually contracting Covid19! #happilyvaccinated
1627	106432	Just tell them the vaccine is weak ... Because I took the shot and the vaccine is weak .... You know how hArd it's to work now after COVID-19 ... My body feels like it's 50 I'm 27...I need a booster shot or new shots treatment .. cause it  weak ..it slow your thoughts down dat it
1628	106163	Yeah but will those children be sterile or get cancer  autism, schizophrenia or autoimmune disease? This is a clinical trial on humans and now their offspring. There is no liability for the pharmaceutical companies and the vaccines aren't FDA approved. Still labeled experimental
1629	105653	@IMHOjustsaying @SysOptSpeMike @BrianAckerman80 @POTUS Flu vaccines are required around the world? You may say why choose the flu vaccine, well that is because it is a yearly shot because the virus mutates, the same as the SARSCoV2 virus which is just a coronavirus.
1630	201767	Super excited and relieved to be getting my first COVID-19 vaccine today. One down one more to go in three weeks. 💉 https://t.co/C7cvd0oOTX
1631	105263	@theheraldsun Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
1632	105232	Bottom line is, just get the fucking vaccine already so we can get this shit over with.  The QUICKER we can get back to NORMAL, the BETTER!This is honestly QUITE tiresome... 😠#COVID19 #Delta
1633	107548	Plus I bet that when we do get a vaccine for Covid-19 the Anti-Vaxxers will be fighting the school districts if it’s required.
1634	105855	@DeAndreHopkins @jalenramsey @MatthewJudon @_fournette @NFL @WFAN660 @7BOOMERESIASON @craigcartonlive Either incredibly STUPID or incredibly SELFISH or just an ahole. Get the vaccine! #PandemicOfTheUnvaccinated #COVIDIOTS #NFL #Covid_19 #CovidVaccine
1635	107560	what did y’all think would happen with the vaccine? it’s the same as a flu vaccine, you’ll still catch the virus, it just won’t affect you as bad as it would without it.

1638	107477	#COVIDー19 Anyone with half-a-brain - and any slither of regard for fellow citizens, who may be in high-risk groups and especially vulnerable to the virus - should stop moaning about having to wear face masks etc, and GROW UP, ffs!An effective vaccine is the ONLY way forward

1640	106312	@realTuckFrumper I don't believe #IvapidIvanka @IvankaTrump will ACTUALLY get the Coronavirus vaccine.  Don't believe those LIARS about ANYTHING.  I'd bet $$$ it will be sterile saline she gets injected with - DON'T BUY their BS!
1641	105694	#lockdown Eventually, this bug will likely become endemic in the population and be a scourge for years until we develop a vaccine and eliminate it. This, of course, is if the anti-vaxers cooperate like they have NOT with measles. #COVID19
1642	201664	All this waiting.....waiting.......just let me make that vaccine! Here, hold my beer.#CoronavirusPandemic
1643	105642	Excellent news, just a matter if time before Moderna gets approved too. Hope this is enough to convince the ”vaccines haven’t been tested enough” - crowd to get the jabs.

1648	105742	@MickyArison Are you considering that people who already had covid get the vaccine too ? Are you aware the damage it does to the heart if you were already infected with Coronavirus  ?Or are you just droning the chant ?
1649	106300	@UPP_Polls I'm worried that the normal flu vaccine is going to be targeted by antivaxxers when fall comes around, probably with claims that the coronavirus is in it or something.It's only going to get worse when the actual COVID-19 vaccines becomes viable.
1650	106054	Bill gates has a patent on coronavirus. So all the research being done and any vaccine created, he will get royalty payments on. @RoninSamTripoli @luisjgomez @lexfridman @NickHintonn @HighersideChats @tconspiracyguys @daylyt30 @joerogan @TimJDillon
1651	106553	Will the vaccine give you any protection? If you look at the data you would have to say yes. If you then ask will the vaccine keep you from getting the coronavirus? Well you would have to say no.
1652	107527	@mjean2 An effective vaccine will protect someone who receives it by lowering the chance of getting COVID-19 if the person encounters the coronavirus. More important is whether the vaccine prevents serious illness, hospitalization and death.
1653	201518	WELL, I am microchipped jk lol but today I was fortunate enough to get the first dose of the Moderna COVID19 vaccineI believe and trust science. In the spirit of full transparency and honesty I will happily answer questions and post if I develop any side effects etc https://t.co/cVc2tnRZsT
1654	107275	"So are we just assuming the Delta variant ceased to exist and those hospitalizations dont matter? This is easily the most aggressive vaccine ad campaign in history. Imagine if the Govt canceled aids treatment because it distributed condoms for Trojan. ""WRAP IT UP OR DIE"" -potus"
1655	201630	@TomTSEC Just like the @CPofCN hoarding the #COVID19bioweapon vaccine from 🇨🇦 even though we collaborated with 🇨🇳 on it, China protects itself first.Funny the CCP ARMY been enjoying the vaccine for 2 months now while India's soliders are fighting #COVID19 and 🇨🇳 at the same time.
1656	106168	This is actually investing advice now. So um... Even though the #SARSCoV2 vaccines from all these vaccine companies and shitty, you should invest in all these vaccine companies in the long term.COVID-19 causes immune amnesia.
1657	106590	Better to go an vaccinated them. They will never maintain Covid appropriate behavior. My domestic help just took a Covid vaccine after so much of persuading. All her slum walas said you will die if you take vaccine.
1658	106321	I will never get over how people are in public not wearing masks and planning parties and going to bars when coronavirus is still a thing and there is no vaccine and not enough testing.
1659	107434	What's the point of the vaccine then if masks are needed? If symptoms show then the vaccine has failed.
1660	106785	@thereds8 I'm a BIG vax supporter but, there is no vaccine ever going to be available for a 'coronavirus'. Our immune system will only build antibodies against it, for, on average, 6 mths.
1661	106332	@SoCalValleyGal @ChytilTonia @charliekirk11 False equivalency when there is testing, vaccine, and an immunity pool to the flu. Look at another Coronavirus mutation like MERS or SARS.
1662	105689	@bridgebum826 @sarahbeth345 I think there actually is a coronavirus vaccine for pets. My dogs haven't received it. They also didn't catch COVID from us when we had it.
1663	105293	@Neoavatara Human beings just do not develop long term immunity to coronaviruses.  No mammals do.  Even canine coronavirus vaccine must be given every year.
1664	107017	Good for Dr. Tedros! #Africa will not be a testing ground for #COVID19 vaccine. Human beings will be treated like human beings, wherever they are. 👏👏👏
1665	106745	@stefaniangelise Yeah no I agree I don’t get it either, all those vaccines aren’t permanent either. The coronavirus has been around for a long time. There are different versions of it and this one is just the easiest spreading. I never got them until the army forced me on deployment to get them
1666	106157	@UgimaKenya Maghufuli is right, it will be a long time before a valid vaccine is found. This means that herd immunity is the way to go presently. Western world covid19 template cant work in African economies. Something is wrong and we are stupid not to call out our inept president
1667	201610	@LadyVelvet_HFQ I'm fully #vaccinated! on 17th Sep '21. 2nd Dose with #COVISHIELD #AstraZeneca Successfully completed the schedule of all doses of COVID-19 vaccine.
1668	105870	@patton6966 Hello Mark, I was given the COVID-19 Vaccine. After a few day, I noticed my joint creaking, then my skin became metallic! I am now a robot and am typing this with my mind. How do I tell the world my story Mike? Beep Boop
1669	106777	Why do some ppl expect a NEW vaccine for a NOVEL (uh, new - never been seen before, figuring out how to treat as we go) Coronavirus to be 100% effective on 1st release?  95% efficacy is pretty damn good. This is a HR and ppl are throwing the ball back on the field. *smh* 🤦‍♀️🤔
1670	201648	I was able to get a COVID-19 vaccine appointment for my dad after waiting TWO hours for the confirmation email, because the site was so overwhelmed. My mom, also a 65+ high-risk stroke/diabetes patient, won her vaccine appointment through a LOTTERY. It shouldn't be this way.
1671	106236	@POTUS don't force all Americans to get vaccine when available.  My body my choice I WILL NOT GET CV IMMUNIZATION.
1672	105766	@davestwittylife They will keep moving the goalposts until November 5. If there is a Covid-19 vaccine in the meantime (very unlikely in my non-medically trained opinion), it will only be 50% effective at best, and will have very troublesome side effects, which they might not tell you about.
1673	107099	And they can’t understand why people don’t take the shot,Vaccines don’t do what their telling us it does, stop trying to kill us
1674	201770	I had the vaccine for #COVID19 today.  I had the JJ.  I still feel nervous.  Like waking up from a nightmare.  I am glad it is over but still stress for having it.
1675	106203	@nick_ramsey Because the big wave is going to hit in 3 4 5 and 6 weeks and the coronavirus will come back next year cyclically by November 20/20 we need a coronavirus vaccine
1676	201558	No hesitation booking my COVID-19 booster vaccine after the booking went live today, thanks to @Leic_hospital #GetVaccinated
1677	106319	@globalnews Definitely not. However, I do hope all the blind conformists and unthinking sheeple will do so in order to give them a false sense of safety and security, so the rest of us can get our lives back. #Covid_19 #COVID19 #EndTheLockdowns #vaccine
1678	106142	@AndreiManko It’s been warned about since day one. Hasn’t anyone stopped to even consider for a second why we haven’t ever had a coronavirus vaccine? Like, ever? There has always clearly been a market for one.
1679	106978	@CDCgov Does the old COVID-19 vaccine work on new virus? Does it stop the spread or just lesson the symptoms? (Asking for a friend, please don’t ban me)
1680	105242	@Gekotweets @Ayaanle_bdi Are you implying Coronavirus is god's revenge on the French for banning Hijab?
1681	106909	@realDonaldTrump @GavinNewsom Perhaps in a year to 18 months there may be a vaccine to stop the spread.  One for the coronavirus as well.
1682	106892	Coronavirus vaccines are free of charge. The NHS will never ask for payment or for your bank details. Be alert to vaccine fraud. #coronavirusfrauds
1683	107244	I believe she has done a great job,her plan was to delay an all at once rush to avoid overloading the health care system which sheaccomplished but Sorry folks the reality is there are limits. Ex. what if there is no vaccine? Do we stay inside forever? never have surgeries?
1684	106550	I wasn’t too sure about getting the vaccine, then Boris Johnson said he is getting it. He’s so trustworthy and has done a great job since becoming PM, that’s my mind made up, I will definitely be getting it too. Said nobody ever.
1685	106177	Tested positive for COVID-19 , my symptoms are non existent. I was sick for a day or two. I think the fact that I took the vaccine has an influence in how I currently feel. I'm actually shocked.
1686	106936	bullshit. the vaccine is a preventative measure, not something that is going to kill a child. before saying that kids shouldn’t get the vaccine, have you asked them about it? it’s their life, their choice. ones who want to get it, can get it. let them live their lives in peace
1687	106083	You hear that @GOP, @GOPChairwoman McDaniel, and @realDonaldTrump the #CODVID19 will not disappear like magic. Unless we have a vaccine available so this virus is going to be around for awhile.
1688	106215	For those of you who don't know. Covid 19 is being labeled a strain of the Coronavirus. Coronavirus is the common cold. Covid 19 has NEVER been isolated as a new strain. How can you make a vaccine for a virus that has NEVER been Isolated? You can't. Get It yet?
1689	106724	@Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump Vaccine progress is good news.  However it is not useful information for how Covid-19 is being managed nationally as of today, or as of the previous 180 days , or as of the next 180days.  153k in death climbing to 300k more before the year is out.  “GREAT JOB NOT” Mr Puppet.
1690	106381	"""almost every fifth #Pole believes that there is no #pandemic""So around 7️⃣ million people does not swallow next #coronashit waves🔥🔥🔥#coronavirus #Covid_19 #vaccine #WW3 #Poland"
1691	201741	@RARohde Travel data indicates a large ( the largest I think) number of travellers from Wuhan.  Korea was third.  I got out of Beijing on the 24th,  7 days, nothing to report.  Got a Vitamin D shot and a Pneumonia vaccine. waiting. Had to cancel my flight to USA,
1692	105250	Actually, flu vaccine upgraded annually.  Already Coronavirus vaccines on the market for pets and has been for DECADES.  Different strain just like influenza.  Flu vaccine comes out ahead of the season every single year. How are experts now saying January rollout not possible?
1693	105813	And just so everybody is clear, getting the vaccine DOES NOT make you immune to getting Covid. What it does do is vastly decrease your chances of dying if you do contract the virus.
1694	107419	There is no proof that this is even slowing Covid. It may be speeding it up. If the vaccine helps then why were the most covid-19 deaths in children, recorded over the last five weeks? If the vaccine is a vaccine then why are more children infected? Kids did not get sick in 2020.
1695	105237	It’s easy. All those sitting around complaining they can’t get vaccinated are just being lazy. Don’t be lazy, go, get vaccine and save your own life.
1696	105418	@BishopJakes This humans would have to test negative for covid-19 first, if not my house is just perfectly fine, we'll most likely get together when there is a vaccine. #Social_Distancing #StayHome
1697	107410	@NoblePhares Covid-19 isn’t unknown, and there is actually a vaccine for it, and it’s free, and it works.. just take the damn vaccine
1698	106577	Wow, just like Trump called it... the Wuhan, China Virus. It’s called covid19 because they already had a name planned for its purpose- the vaccine!
1699	105797	To say I'm scared is an understatement. I'm still waiting for my vaccination schedule together with my fellow doctors &amp; nurses in Makati. Waiting for DOH to release how much vaccine will be allocated. So waiting game right now esp if private sector frontliners non hospital based
1700	107327	Our poll find 53% don’t believe vaccine passports will be implemented 47% do #NoVaccinePassportsAnywhere #coronavirus #PoliticsLive #news #OpenForAll #FreedomDay
1701	105663	This is a complete psy op. There is no way in hell that they are taking the actual vaccine. I would bet my life on it.
1702	105730	OMG, I thought it was a compete hoax and conspiracy theory, but had my COVID jab earlier and my arm has just started beeping and connected to the Bluetooth on my phone… anyone else has this!?#COVID #coronavirus #AstraZeneca #PfizerVaccine #DeltaVariant
1703	105274	You are absolutely 100% correct because when you get Covid you have more antibodies then when you get the vaccine. You are so right!!!
1704	201701	Glad to have had my Covid19 vaccine today @CUH_NHS. Felt a bit sick for a few mins after the vaccine, but well worth having. https://t.co/Rvypg0yAcl
1705	107050	@KalopaMom @RobertKennedyJr There is one sentence in this article that will prove they are lying... “While there are currently no known risks of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine while pregnant, scientists are in the process of gathering additional data to learn more.”  If you think there are NONE ur an idiot.
1706	105226	I am vegan.  COVID19 vaccines are not vegan or cruelty free.  I don't want to have the vaccine for this reason. #TheOnlyWayIsVegan
1707	106195	This is my story guys. Feel free to share yours. Maybe, just maybe, someone who is reluctant to vaxx will read it and decide they dont wanna go through what you went through and go get jabbed
1708	106377	@dwallacewells I am triple vaxxed, but don't get why we don't lock down unless and until we reach a larger vaxxed percentage. Japan has 90% and pretty much no coronavirus deaths. We still have 1200+/day. If the endemic strategy is to succeed, we need more vaccinated ppl.
1709	107088	@CBCAlerts “Doctors are worried that coronavirus may end up being like influenza, which requires a new vaccine every year both because the circulating strains mutate fast and because immunity from the vaccine wears off quickly.”
1710	106595	@dspondike @BretWeinstein The question is how well those so-called “vaccines” actually work. Because they do not deliver “immunity”, the definition of “vaccine” was recently revised to a risk/benefit ratio—without acknowledging COVID-19 “vaccine”-related injury and death.
1711	105472	I'm so going to enjoy rubbing this in the face of these Nigerian liberals. They called us all sorts for questioning the safety of their precious vaccines. Oya see am nau.And this will likely be the very tip of the iceberg.Mandating experimental drugs is stupid.
1712	107415	We wonder when @ncstatecollege will do likewise. We don't want the Mansfield Campus to become a #SuperSpreader site. #VaccinesSaveLives!#PandemicOfTheUnvaccinated#richlandrocks
1713	105892	It's only supposed to lower your symptoms... they've told everyone a million times, you can still catch the virus and have symptoms with the vaccine🙅‍♀️
1714	106793	Suicide? 🤔 think “self suicide” is the only one that a person can do 😂😂😂 just love twitter kids being as insane as they can 😂 Tam SHOULD take her/his/their/there/xe own vaccine. Don’t ban me! Just don’t remember all the pronouns needed!
1715	107263	Jill isn’t a real doctor y’all. We talked about this last week, so how is she already getting the vaccine?
1716	106025	@kbeanie93 Turkey has stated you can enter without jab or a Coronavirus test. If enough people boycott other countries, they will either fill w turkey stance or face the end of their tourism. The people hold the power on this one, not the government
1717	106427	It's getting worse not better. But hope may be on the way in the form of a vaccine and administration that actually TRIES to stop the virus
1718	105728	@TradeEuropa Panic it's bad but we should preper to situation like in Wuhan it's now. Just to time vaccine in hospitals. China made this panic bcz ppl send so many movies with dead bodys, u can count this deadth cases &amp; thers numbers are bigger then China they give us in information.
1719	105962	@Maselli_Andrea @Forbes Yea, just showing how stupid all of this is! People are wishing death on the other people who don't want to get this COVID-19 vaccine. And we never had people acting like this back in the day when other people didn't want to get any of those other vaccines we have out there.
1720	106017	While I do not wish COVID-19 on any one or their loved ones but (you knew this was coming) if more are to get sick or die it would be ok with me because those without masks and vaccines provide those openings for the virus!
1721	105953	@Forbes So the vaccines don't work?Wouldn't it be a better outcome to get and get over covid-19 if a person is young and healthy?
1722	107481	“the covid-19 vaccine is like the PS5: everybody wants it, nobody can get it, and if you’re rich you already got it like a month ago” sometimes snl has good jokes
1723	107308	Repeat after me:We are under lockdown to slow the spread of COVID-19 so that our healthcare systems can cope.We are NOT under lockdown to kill the virus or stop it.Life as we know it is done for the foreseeable, until we get a vaccine or herd immunity (maybe). Got it?
1724	105667	@olives4fun @stltoday No mRNA vaccine has ever been approved, it doesn’t operate like a vaccine, it’s experimental and not fully tested. Every attempt at a vaccine against any coronavirus has made subsequent infection worse. There are effective treatments available.
1725	105963	Dad got the COVID-19 vaccine today and mom gets it Monday!! I’m so excited for them and also a little jealous lol shoutout to my two favorite doctors 💜
1726	105950	@GBNEWS Do you think it's weird how no world leaders not even the @WHO came out 2 years ago at the start of the pandemic and said take Vitamin D, take Vitamin C and take Zinc, do exercise and get sunshine? They never told us how to prevent getting #COVID19 they just said #vaccineswork
1727	106983	@susan46775136 @kissandmakeupuk @dwilliam9940 It's not a vaccines, it's actually gene editing,permanently changing human DNA. New human species is the result. This has killed all tests animals it was tested on within 12 months after contact with a wild coronavirus. Time bomb ticking in jabbed population.
1728	107418	Let’s get this clear, just because you get a flu jab does not make you completely immune to flu. So think, a half #coronavirus immune jab will not prevent getting it, so please have a brain, wear a mask&amp;wash your hands. Stay within your bubble &amp;home. @BorisJohnson @MattHancock
1729	107042	if you haven't, please get vaccinated so we can go back to normal and all these people (including) won't be dying of a disease we already have the MF'ing vaccine for Just do it, you're wasting all of our lives now. Are we gonna spread this out another decade?
1730	107238	If this is the case then why will I need to declare my vaccine status (with a piece of paper or app) to get into a pub? What next?  I had my hemarroids done before I can sit down anywhere?
1731	107074	They vaccine will have aborted fetus cells in it, ipso facto, religious exception should be honored.  We are Americans not cattle
1732	107583	@BBCBreaking I don’t get how they can say the so called vaccine will defeat this virus because coronavirus can’t be cured and will always mutate, also what about the Brazilian and South African strain, the vaccine doesn’t work with them.
1733	107081	"Dr. Chaitra Ujjani: ""A lot of our patients have suffered in isolation and fear, and they're not sure they're going to get back to a normal life,"" ""So every oncologist is interested to see how their patients will respond to the vaccine.""@SeattleCCA"
1734	105984	The 🇬🇧 fully supports @antonioguterres and the vital @UN work fighting #coronavirus. Today we discussed the need for a coordinated global response to reinforce the most vulnerable countries, accelerating the search for a vaccine &amp; bringing countries together to defeat this virus.
1735	105863	A vaccine for coronavirus is coming.  But will it be ready, or not?  Trump has become obsessed with launching a vaccine, thinking it’s his best hope for reelection.  New polling shows voters seriously skeptical of the  remedy and the rush.
1736	106131	▶️Full lockdown until we have a vaccine...OK▶️Live under authoritarian rule (but not full lockdown)       until we have a vaccine...OK▶️Vaccine may only be 70% effective...OK▶️Vaccine may only be 50% effective...WTF?!Do you not see what is happening?????????????
1737	107279	@AyinAzirinee Depends how it’s ‘pinched’. The needle (for COVID-19 vaccines) should go into the muscle, so some pinching is ok but not till the needle only enters the fat layer. Usually pinching is not needed for intramuscular injections. Other vaccines might be different
1738	106193	BUT, BLM/Antifa anarchy ‘gatherings’ are acceptable. Wake up America!They don’t wear masks because they know something they are not sharing with us? Fear is used to control, like demand you wear masks and stay inside.Bull!The only way forward is herd immunity,not deadly vaccines!
1739	107479	@Browney86195309 As per the NHS website, having the vaccine gives you long lasting protection again Covid -19.  There is however still a small chance you can get or spread coronavirus, even if you have the vaccine.  P&amp;O Cruises are determined to protect the health of all guests and crew on board.
1740	201572	@calico_heart_ My heart is failing and I have Stage 4 prostate cancer. No one wants to tell me how long I will be here. Got my two Covid-19 vaccine shots, though!
1741	106435	Shit like this is why I stay home. And will be as much as possible even when they find a vaccine for the virus because unfortunately, there is no vaccine for this kind of stupid shit.
1742	106792	Took my aunt @passionate4ever to get her first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at @meijer. Lots of people waiting, but very efficient and easy process getting in and out.
1743	105617	So true. Vaccine in NZ pathetically slow. Not good enough to b smugly sipping flat whites and feeling sorry 4 the rest of the world. Need to re-engage.
1744	105544	It is unknown how long the immunity provided by the #COVIDVaccine may last, however, if one still get infected even after #COVID19Vaccination, #COVIDVaccines protect against severe disease and hospitalisation due to #COVID19.#COVID_19 #COVID__19 #COVID #COVIDー19 #coronavirus
1745	107206	Get the vaccine, or Don't get the vaccine. I do not care, because it is your choice. I will not treat you any different either way, and that my friends is how freedom works.#vaccine #COVID19 #freedom
1746	107021	I said mutations would come. Sadly vaccine resistant ones will develop soon enough. Then a strain which attacks younger people with greater results. The pandemic will never end. Prepare for the worst. Hope for the best. Anarchy is only ever a few bad months away🙏
1747	201742	Pfizer, for example, the company recruited 43,661 volunteers and waited for 170 people to come down with symptoms of Covid-19 and then get a positive test. Out of these 170, 162 had received a placebo shot, and just eight had received the real vaccine.
1748	201658	I’ve just had my COVID-19 Oxford/AstraZeneca Vaccination. A huge thank you to @NHSuk @ENHertsCCG @StJohnsOx and the volunteers on hand.The process was seamless and conducted with military efficiency. Excellent 👏🏻 #CovidVaccine #oxfordastrazeneca https://t.co/VCdQkecHdn
1749	105539	@Mike_Fabricant @ArchRose90 Why are employers sacking the un-vaxxed - the vaxxed can still get Covid-19 and still spread it to others - so there is no protection of staff or customers ??? Can any employer or manager or MP explain this ???
1750	106906	THIS IS INFURIATING! 🤬 DO PARENTS NOT REALIZE HOW MUCH THEY ARE PUTTING THEIR KIDS AT RISK!?!?!? Immediately we should: 📍MANDATE vaccines for school (in person and virtual) 📍REVOKE CUSTODY if you do not get your kids vaccinated. 📍FINES AND/OR IF THAT DOESN’T WORK: JAIL!
1751	106130	@CBCOntarioToday @SALCOntario This is laughable, the demographic that listens to your program doesn't work for or live in #poverty...How come cbc employees don't jump up to the microphone, like they did with #COVID19 and #VaccinePassport B.S., but these issues have been going on a lot longer then 2 yrs.??!!
1752	107322	#Shame, #shame. #shame scaring people to NOT TAKE A VACCINE that may protect them from COVID19! USING FEAR BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE VACCINE IS COMING IS JUST WRONG! @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden

1756	201613	Shout out to my immune system for helping me survive when I was infected with COVID-19 one year ago. Several months later I received both doses of the Moderna vaccine. Now it is about that time for a booster shot. #getvaccinated #herdimmunity
1757	107317	@destinchickMBA @ABC It's called a coronavirus and he downplayed it for months after asking if a flu vaccine would cover it or doctors had considered if uv light shined on the lungs would save us all. Unless he does something concrete nobody cares if he still blathers on like a fruitbat.
1758	106922	@SkyNews @SkyNewsThomas Ooo, I think so. I have been anyway. I’m vaxxed and had the booster, so I’ve done as I’ve been told and I am not getting on with my life. #COVID19 isn’t going to miraculously disappear, so it’s time to start learning to live with it. You know, like we have for every other virus.
1759	201726	The St. Joseph Health Department had a pleasant surprise at the second dose COVID-19 vaccine clinic held at the Open Door Food Kitchen Thursday. A handful of residents came to the kitchen and asked for the shot for the first time. https://t.co/kZxF6PmVcx
1760	106798	Any sentence with “until we have a vaccine” is a waste of words.  When ever we do have one it will be 12 to 18 months for efficacy. Why is no one being realistic about this? #covid19australia #COVID19
1761	107494	The #SerumInstitute of India wants ₹3000 crore from the Modi govt to ramp up the #vaccine production capacity in the #COVID19Era.Who do they think they are.Why would the govt waste such an amount that can easily fund another new Ultra Luxurious Jet Plane for our poor PM?
1762	106815	The vaccines will eventually be here, but in the meantime (3+ months for most), there is a deadly COVID-19 storm raging out there, be very careful. ICUs and medical staff will be overloaded for months to come.
1763	106923	So the entire #Covid_19 #lockdown is because “if it saves 1 life” so i’m guessing if the #vaccine kills 1 person its a no go right? #BillGates #COVID19
1764	105594	Im done. This is me not leaving my house but once a week for groceries. I can't do this. I spent a year in fear for my life. I was relieved when I got the vaccine. But now this! I don't want to do this anymore.
1765	201781	My mom is scheduled to get the COVID-19 vaccine next week! 🤗🙌🏾💉(Lol could've got mines too if I was still working at the hospital)
1766	106467	"2/ Last I checked, ""China"" isn't sitting in the White House leading the US #coronavirus response from Jan 2020 to today. Mr. Trump is supposedly ""leading"" it. So guess who is to blame for how bad our country has handled it? The BUCK stops with @realDonaldTrump!#vaccine"
1767	106080	#GenocideJohnson making us take it on the chin, letting it just move through the population, so our loved ones will die. As planned from the beginning, so continuing now. Mass death and disability without a vaccine.
1768	107444	Absolutely not. That liquid called a vaccine has led to more infections throughout China. People think they are vaccinated and end up spreading the virus. Keep the virus contained there.
1769	106669	I’m really struggling to cope with this pandemic, what if a vaccine is never developed and coronavirus never goes away? Will we have to socially distance forever? Every time I see the term ‘new normal’ in the media I’m filled with dread and anxiety. I can’t keep living like this.
1770	106264	@NaviiThaHBIC @we38we38 @PkmnMasterHolly @MYSTIC7 Yes, but this wouldn’t be the first Coronavirus I survived. I served in an area that had MERS-CoV....and that coronavirus had a 35% death rate and it still doesn’t have a vaccine. And for 20+ years we have been sending people in and out, and nobody got test leaving.
1771	106363	@BNODesk The best thing we can do is just live with and take basic precautions unless you want a booster shot every 2-3 months. It seems this coronavirus acts like a cold virus when it comes to escaping the immune system.
1772	106158	$TBIO ~Yes they have a #COVID19 vaccine JV with $SNY... and we already knew that back in May. #stocks #stockstowatch #StockTrading #StocksToTrade #stockMarket #Covid19usa #covid19US  #COVID19Ontario #COVIDCanada #coronavirus #Covid_19 #COVIDー19 #COVID19ON #CoronaVirusCanada
1773	105707	So then why would I want to get it?!? If people were afraid to leave their house for a virus with a 99.9% chance of survival, I would say it’s justified for me not to want the vaccine if theirs a small % I will still catch the Vid. Right? I’m “tRuStInG tHe ScIeNcE”
1774	105726	@o_rips I have just started following this stuff and I'm horrified, more so for my kids.It's hard that you can also not openly talk about it without being labelled as an antivax looneyScaring times ahead, how do we ensure we don't have to have covid vaccine when it comes out?
1775	105972	This is just so unimaginable and sad. Thinking of everyone who lost someone. Please continue to stay safe and keep others safe by getting the vaccine.
1776	105264	This really hit home.  One of the reasons I got my 1st covid vaccine was for my peace of mind.  Hopefully after my 2nd shot it will help me with my anxiety so I can leave my bubble that I have been living in for a year.  I need to do what is best for me. #COVID19 #anxiety
1777	105474	About the vaccine..Research is still ongoing &amp; no one knows how long a person can be immune. Should people who already had covid with long-term effects be in a priority group too?#CoronaInfoCH #COVIDー19 #Covid_19 #coronavirus #switzerland #suisse #schweiz #retweet #share
1778	105756	A Russian scientist has studied the coronavirus for 40+ years. He tells me that the virus has mutated over 22,000 times. So, the virus will win and stay with us. Good luck #NoVaccinePassports #NoVaccineMandates
1779	105541	🤔💉doesn’t the vaccine mean you can’t get it ??? If so ..then there is no state of emergency—no restrictions #bylaw 🖕🏽#lol  these leaders ..#allaroundtheworld oh and if you don’t get the vaccine ??I hope u get it and 💀 for being so ignorant and stupid towards your fellow humans
1780	105525	@erinotoole This pandemic has been catastrophic for the country - devastating for business and so hard on people and families. That you would politicise vaccines is scurrilous, unprofessional, self-serving and TERRIFYING, because people will believe you. STOP. RETRACT!
1781	201645	We got the J-Book, Lil Fizz, Raz B, and Omarion variants because y'all can't make an accessible vaccine and the other g'all won't take it. Shit went from Covid-19 to Covid-B2K just like that.

1784	106668	Is Djokovic vaccine hésitations catching up with him ? Some may think it is hubris.Did he catch coronavirus in the past or did people get infected after his tournament ?
1785	105628	Why do they? I had no hesitation about taking the vaccine, everyone I know who’s had it had no hesitations and people yet to have it have no hesitations. Even if they do have hesitations they appreciate they have to. If anything it’s the older generations that are antivaxxers.
1786	105695	Just keep it moving. Open it up so that everyone who wants to get the vaccine can. No point bemoaning the vaccine hesitant. With coaxing and different incentives, in time some will get it. As for those who are totally against it (a minority hopefully), nothing you can do.

1791	105398	@hornyforwater @McauleyHolmes It starts there. Then they’re going to do the COVID-19 tracer.  Then it’s going to be mandatory vaccines.  They are killing more people in the isolation then they are the virus. The solution should never be worse than the problem &amp; it is!
1792	201631	Just got my first covid vaccine shot. It's been incredibly well organized (thank you FEMA). Sorry Deathsantis, you don't get credit for lower numbers. Your biggest cities are the ones who implemented mask mandates and occupancy limits. #COVID19

1797	106552	@mel_faith1 @Cocoa_Bean10 You make a good point, however COVID19 stands for coronavirus which is the easiest to make a vaccine for. We actually pick up what Chinese scientists were uploading that gave America a clue in the very first days. And my feeling is HIV was NOT deemed important to American’s.
1798	106246	@SykesCharlie @JoeBiden who probably would not survive the novel #coronavirus, like @POTUS45 did, should be thanking #Trump profusely for the vaccine he received in December 2020.

1805	105837	@Ponderosa1415 @Charb532 @corpkid1 @fakebillyzoom @GovRonDeSantis How was Sweden able to attain herd immunity from coronavirus long before the vaccine came out? Not everyone who doesn't want the vaccine is childish. If you'd actually listen to some of their reasons, you might not agree with their logic, but you might understand why.
1806	107608	... people who had COVID-19 already may feel that they do not need to take the vaccine. I would be interested in pointers to whether people have checked for this, e.g. polls about vaccine hesitancy” including the option “I will not get the vaccine because I was already infected”
1807	106356	Ok if this is for real??then this is bigand this also makes trump correct,just not the greatest at getting message across but it’s not his fault if stupid ppl want to drink bleach.but again if true,then this is big.I would if proven to be true and work do this b4 vaccines.
1808	106289	how shitty can our country get that OTHER countries literally have to rush a vaccine so that they can help EVERYONE FOR FREE bc the US actually doesn’t care about helping those in need, they care about making  money LMAO i hate it here

1811	107051	Here we go again, the politicians have ignored what the scientists told them: that if the virus wasn't suppressed the vaccine rollout would have the chance to achieve herd immunity, and we will be back to square one...
1812	201505	My parents got vaccinated for COVID-19 today. Theres a lot of mixed feelings about this vaccine &amp; vaccines in general. But let me just say that having elderly parents in todays social climate, I am grateful that they decided to get it. I still need them here with me, God willing.

1819	201642	@shelterisland90 @mattgaetz I got the vaccine during the first rollout.  So I'm guessing this data is new, but at the time I worked on the Covid19 floor.  I never got it while at work.  I only caught Delta after the vaccine immunity waned.  Symptoms were mild so hopefully it worked 🤞
1820	106560	@UWM @UWSystem @TommyThompsonWI stop waiting until things get terrifyingly worse and require the vaccine for students! You already messed up with moving in students into the dorms without it.
1821	105491	3Also clear: “Most said they weren’t against all vaccines; they were just a ‘no’ on this vaccine. They were COVID-19 no-vaxxers, not overall anti-vaxxers”The reasons for this must be more deeply engaged with.When lines are drawn simply -we miss the complication.

1832	107273	Wake up idiots. Corporations do not have the authority or right to discriminate against you for not taking an vaccine. It's a violation of the Nuremburg Code and a human rights violation. They're lying to you as they demoralize you with lockdowns for compliance. #COVID19
1833	106639	The way trump has embarrassed us on the world stage. Think about this. Assuming any other country creates the covid-19 vaccine before America does. Where will America fall on the distribution list. My guess is last. So hunker down folks.
1834	105961	I am not taking another COVID-19 booster shot. My right leg locked and could not move it for 20 minutes until just now.
1835	105851	@RealMickFoley Yep!They've been working on the SARS-CoV-1 vaccine for over 20 years &amp; then when the coronavirus hit, SARS-CoV-2, they just switched to produce the vaccines we currently have to fight COVID 19. So anyone's logic that they don't trust them because they were rushed, THEY WERE NOT!
1836	106275	@ProjectAzorian7 @BigOrangeJB @newschannelnine *Coronavirus but good job showing your hand. But yeah ultimately an Officer uses discretion on certain laws like you brought up with speed limits, but sure.

1839	105723	Add Italy to that list now too. The new coronavirus variant is around 70% more infectious, ministers say, but NO evidence so far to suggest it causes more severe illness or wouldn’t respond to vaccine.
1840	105243	@MeidasTouch We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies. Ask the FDA about it.

1848	107552	@RealKPenceNotSL How is a healthy unvaccinated person a public threat?  THERE IS NO VACCINE WHICH PREVENTS COVID19.

1849	107557	@NCIDirector @FLOTUS @theNCI Realistically if we can get a vaccine in 1 year for coronavirus, because of unlimited funding from nearly every nation, course a cure for cancer is out there! Not enough is being done and too much red tape and greedy corrupt pharmaceuticals  #WorldCancerDay

1871	105455	@TomiLahren The choice of whether to get the vaccine or not isn't only about whether we think that we ourselves would get Covid-19 or survive it if we do.  It's about achieving herd immunity to put the pandemic behind us once and for all so that life can get back to normal again.

1875	106965	My take, FWIW: the prediction that 60-80% of us will get coronavirus is still true.  And current level of lockdown can;t last until there's a vaccine.  So at some point we are all going have to go out and face the virus again, only this time more will catch it.  Question is when.

1893	105441	@chrislepkowski Similar experience but after only having 1st jab. First time I'd been inside a social venue since it opened, wearing my mask unless sat at my table. Got COVID19 and only just had all clear today. It's horrible, goodness knows what it would have been like without a jab.
1894	106979	"""Ya but I'm vaccinated"" is the response I got when I told someone they seem to be going places like covid is no longer a threat. Forget immunization, the COVID-19 vaccine seems to have given everyone a confidence boost."
1895	107412	Since Putin has inoculated his daughter first, we need to bank upon the effectiveness of the vaccine. Putin has tightly slapped Xi Jinping in the face after he wilfully spread the virus, across the world. China has given birth to this pandemic. Xi should be charged with genocide.
1896	105225	The world is waitingBut don't buy the stock market hype around coronavirus vaccine and treatment companies (CNN Business)
1897	106217	@HillaryClinton New studies are coming out showing that if you had Covid-19 your still immune. So those who have had COVID-19 should consider if they need it or not. There are no long term studies on the vaccine to know how long it last since it’s NOT a virus. Be smart, research and decide 4 You
1898	105621	@HD2onPBdotcom @yggdrasilash24 @tnewtondunn Doctors are being told to write Covid-19 for all patients. Even those dying of advanced cancer. Just like a doctor wrote pneumonia for my mother 20 years ago when what she actually died of was progressive supranuclear palsy. Who is selling the kits &amp; the vaccines? Follow the ££££
1899	106774	@mbzy89 @samhealey1 @madhatterpress @AnnastaciaMP All viruses mutate and the native nature of a common coronavirus, (its not novel anymore after over 2yrs), is that the mutation devolves. No-one ever catches the same coronavirus twice due to how the bodies immunity system works.Faux vaccines will also create weird strains.
1900	105938	I am sad to say this #coronavirus is not going away anytime soon, Even after a #vaccine, you cant #vaccinate for the basic coronavirus, so making a vaccination for #COVID19= I believe is next to impossible Simply because basic Coronavirus is naturally your common cold #virus!
1901	107251	@ChrisAlderson17 A) Your immune system relies on antibodies to work, and if you haven't contracted this virus, you don't have any.B) Acute COVID-19 illness is multi-systemic, long-lasting and still poorly understood.C) Billions died of disease until vaccines were discovered.
1902	107072	Just three Marines who requested a religious exemption to the legally mandated coronavirus vaccine have had their requests granted.THEY ARE PURPOSELY GUTTING THE MILITARY.
1903	106749	@deray Besides there being no vaccine as yet, there’s also no antiviral (like Tamiflu) to ease coronavirus.
1904	107367	EXCELLENT NEWS. Very SAD In My Own Country, The United Kingdom☹️ We Have Vaccines But Very Little Actual Vaccinations. Don’t Forget Us, Please.🙏🏻
1905	106463	@piwnation Yes, they definitely can. It just depends on the company you work for values. The COVID-19 vaccine is not the first vaccine to be mandated in the work place.
1906	105294	@GOP Those of you who refuse to get the Covid-19 vaccine or don't get your second shot are the ones whining about the country not opening fast enough. You are the ones allowing mutations. Get the vaccine and get over it.
1907	106608	Instead of just reading news headlines, you should do some actual research and educate yourself. Reading is kinda a requirement for being a legislator. There is a vaccine for the flu. We need to be careful and patient until we are able to get/ distribute a vaccine for corona.
1908	107500	@Forbes Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
1909	106218	@Get_To_Living @ashsimonee Where I work it’s optional too but hopefully down the road we don’t see infomercials about “if you or a loved one took the COVID-19 vaccine and later got diagnosed with (insert disease here) than you may be entitled to financial compensation” I don’t know the long term effects.
1910	107035	@Jailbreak145Px @stoolpresidente We still have no vaccine for SARS or MERS, two other corona viruses from this century. They’ve been working on them for 8-17 years. I wouldn’t be so sure about this Coronavirus vaccine.
1911	106569	I think there's many that would rather take their chances, me included.I don't want any of the issues that they'll possibly tag on to the vaccine, after all you'd be a customer for life, let's face it, big pharma need lifelong customers!#vaccines #COVID19 #TakeMyChance

1914	201624	@shellymarriage @CHCHNews @CHCHTV Sadly I just missed it ! Just turned on @CHCHNews as I just got home from getting my 1st covid19 vaccine
1915	107126	So let me get this straight. We could get over coronavirus in the summer because of the heat but we don’t know if cv can survive in it or not, a vaccine can take a year, isolation/quarentine for 6 months??? Yeah...no
1916	107124	@TonyGuanthwei @buffalohunterCB @CarryOnWaywdSon @Roscoe17761 @laralogan What vaccine did they take??was it really applied and in the right dosage??did they not get covid19 in the hospital before taking the vaccine???The vaccine prevented them from dying.
1917	106794	Now a pill has been introduced to beat covid19 is there really any need to repeatedly inject people? The 'vaccine' 🙄 efficacy does not last, it has to be repeatedly given so why not treat instead?
1918	201540	@TurmoilRockBand @WG_Gervais @AMcA32449832 @arkmedic all crew on the deployment had received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine and the outbreak was being managed.

1920	106382	i just sat in an 8 hour flight with a trump supporter who wouldn’t stop ranting about how the coronavirus is all a part of trump’s plan and that as long as we don’t take a vaccine then we won’t get infected,,,,,,
1921	107447	1. I have absolutely considered this happening. A week or so before the election, Trump will get an FDA approval for a vaccine. Their CEO will hit the news circuits saying that the vaccine couldn’t have happened without Trump.

1939	105383	Can we normalize not asking people if got their vaccine? Like seriously, it’s a violation of my HIPPA! Do you go around asking everyone you talk to if they have an std or ever had an abortion? I didn’t think so. #NoneOfYourBusiness #KeepThatSameEnergy #Covid19 #Vaccination
1940	106763	It’s so tiring to listen to the MSM blame conservatives for the spike in the coronavirus.  If it were up to them, we would all be in a deep dark depression and no one would leave their home until there was a vaccine.
1941	107392	@baccantuscany @TeaPainUSA when Coronavirus vaccine comes out, they should just pray. They have God on their side.
1942	106039	@Walkabout24 Difficult! I've had my 1st Covid-19 jab because, as a COPD sufferer, my respiratory system is compromised. I've had a pneumococcal jab for the same reason. I will never carry a vaccine passport, vaccination is an invasive procedure &amp; must always be voluntary.
1943	105883	It is everywhere. Everywhere. Contact tracing will be close to impossible in the coming weeks. Where did you get it? From anywhere. From anyone. It. Is. Everywhere. We are excited for vaccines. They can't come soon enough. Those @pfizer trucks better drive safely:)

1963	106123	The left displays yet again their political narrative of #COVID19. They don't want a successful vaccine because they don't want life to return to normal. They hate self determination. They need people relying on govt. They're the ones who don't value human life. #LiberateAmerica
1964	106504	Exactly and died few days later. Of course they don't want people to know. How else can the VACCINATOR depopulate the world if people refuse the vaccine. Hence no body gets their stimulus money unless they take the vaccine. Fuckouttahere.

2005	105683	The likelihood is coronavirus is here to stay forever, like any virus. However there is no vaccine currently. We are in a recession, money makes the workd go round. so how do you move forward? Wouldn’t like to be making that decision.
2006	106391	@21WIRE That's actionable legally I think, they haven't isolated the covid19 virus, so how can there be a test or a vaccine?  Lawyer up if you can parents and students.

2008	106771	We still don’t know if having #antibodies gives immunity but it surely has to be good to have them! It’s also a relief to be know for def I had #Coronavirus. The results can tell researchers where outbreaks have been in Scotland and antibodies may also be used to make a vaccine.

2011	107464	@BeholdIsrael Amir didn't say to get the Covid-19 vaccine. It isn't the mark of the beast, either. If it's combined with the quantum dot, might be the precursor, but for it to be the 'mark', you'd have to choose to serve the anti-christ. True Christians won't be here then. Not saying to get it
2012	105467	So, a mandatory vaccine policy, but not a mandatory vaccine? So just words and nothing meaningful. 😑 “Education session”? That’s the whole problem - anti vaxxers getting Facebook and YouTube educations. If they cared to learn they would have by now. #LTC #LTCJustice #onpoli
2013	106114	"Everyone waiting for a vaccine so their lives can go back to ""normal"" might want to think about this as they plan their vote. #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica"
2014	106306	@SheaSerrano I too am Vaxxed up and I feel as though I can beat Tyson Fury. I will pimp slap a coronavirus.
2015	105425	Why would he create a vaccine for the first 3 years of his campaign he started it this year. Trumps admin created operation warp speed and that's the only reason we have this vaccine. This has to be parody.
2016	106099	Why is no one talking about why the vaccine is not available in other developing countries? Bill Gates all of a sudden gone radio silent...
2017	105612	I don’t even think people know why they’re refusing the Vaccine, At this point it’s like Kids Fighting Sleep, You know this is good for you, you just don’t want to be told what to do. #vaccine #Vaccination #COVID19 #CovidVaccine #GetVaccinated #GettheVaccine
2018	107495	If any member of the Ontario provincial govt had any honour amongst them they would resign but they don’t. Alas, they must be fired. #FordVaccineFailure #FireFord #cdnpoli #onpoli
2019	107475	@NEWS1130 This is the far-left tactic to always everybody up into one group I'm sorry to burst your stupid little bubble news 11:30 but not all people who don't want the vaccine are called anti vaxers some got the flu shot so I'm got other shots not All them what the covid-19 shot
2020	106814	Says the same scientists who said that the vaccine would still work to protect people against the variant of Covid. Why are they turning back on what they have said now?
2021	106893	@canmannis69 1) You'll need to specify which vaccine2) SAR1B, a GTPase involved in ER to Golgi transport, is not a target for treating COVID-193) The only way to be sure you won't get the virus is to avoid all contact with other people. Or you could just get the vaccine like normal people
2022	107200	@Eddiiiiiiie_ All depend at the rate coronavirus spread. They are not getting the vaccine, so it  is contingent of when they catch the fake virus.
2023	105770	Biological E and J&amp;J entered into a agreement to manufacture this vaccine last October. It took so long for our govt to place orders for this vaccine?
2024	105981	YEAHCanada ❤ I pray America stops giving the option of testing or vaccines....it's absurd.One can be asymptomatic, so testing is not sufficient.This will.never end if we don't get all vaxxed
2025	105906	Kudos University of Ghana. Kudos Noguchi. We've been waiting for news like this. Keep the vaccine too coming...
2026	107446	@fionamflanagan1 The goal of the BLT-L mice project in Saskatoon is to make a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans. If it is the Mark of the Beast, perhaps it's fitting that 100's of babies are being sacrificed to make the humanized mice to test it, but very few care about any of that.
2027	107345	@chipshrimpson @CraftFan33 @LisaMarieBoothe the animal reservoirs found in coronavirus enable the virus to pass between humans and animals thus meaning you will never eradicate this virus with a vaccine like which was able to be done with polio or small box…neither polio nor small box had animal reservoirs
2028	105609	This is what 2020 logic looks like folks. You have to take a rushed vaccine with lower efficacy than your immune response to the virus or face permanent restrictions on your freedoms 🤦🏼‍♀️Even with a vax restrictions might have to stay, because our government want us to be safe 🙄
2029	106820	This... this is actually pretty cool. They're all bad guys but people are dumb and look up to them and need to get a fuckin vaccine.
2030	105805	can’t believe they are people smart enough to develop a coronavirus vaccine and i’m proud of myself for weeks if i get ONE question right on university challenge
2031	105579	If we can't get vaccines in a timely manner, perhaps this is a worthwhile option for Alberta @jkenney .
2032	105853	A jury delivered a split verdict for a radical government. 'The nature of the coronavirus pandemic this week they've begun testing their experimental coronavirus vaccines on humans in the U.S.
2033	106880	This is impossible.There is no way that they would even have 100 safe, tested, verified vaccines produced.We already know how to make vaccines for influenza, which mutates each year, and we barely manage to get those out in a 12 month span.
2034	107101	@LoveLover75000 @SusanStJames3 If you take a Coronavirus vaccine, you're insane.  Do some research.  Also, it's not needed. HCQ works as treatment, and there are other therapies being worked on. We are way closer to herd immunity than ppl realize, by the time they have a vax, it won't be needed.
2035	106460	"@mattandrews1023 @JoeConchaTV I think COVID-19 is an unpredictable problem. We know it's not going away anytime soon. Being ""done"" with it means having a vaccine. Some 200 vaccines are in development and will take a year or more to be effective if we're lucky."
2036	107622	Why do they need a vaccine since according to them COVID is a made up virus, or no worse than the flu, and they can’t be bothered to wear masks? How about give it to frontline workers in ALL industries first, esp those forced to work in dangerous conditions by executive order?
2037	106599	Ya no shit Sherlock.  If the vaccine does not stop the spread then it is more like an antibiotic. And we know what they say about taking too many antibiotics.
2038	105830	And how the hell do y’all know the vaccines work against the “Delta” variant, when there is no actual proof behind it. People just keep lining up though.
2039	107547	17 hours after getting the COVID-19 vaccine for the second time, and my head is throbbing with an amount of pain. I've had migraines that are worse, though. My eyes hurt my entire body just feels like a bruise. I feel vaguely feverish, but it's not enough to actually BE feverish.
2040	105453	@NSimmo8 @Nikki_EDD @LonsdaleKeith @ukboffin1 @IsabelOakeshott We aren’t really immune to flu because it’s one of those virus’s that mutate every year-so a new vaccine is needed -whereas they can’t even find a vaccine to cure the coronavirus
2041	105433	@SBSNews @FatherBob 200 with 150 fines and 15 arrests apparently. And if a single one of them comes anywhere near my family there will be hell to pay! The rest of us have given up so much to try to beat this bloody #coronavirus but there's no vaccine for stupid. #auspol
2042	107511	I truly hope that this would NOT happen, but science is science. This is like the polio vaccine all over again. Protect your children, folks. Don't play politics with their lives. As a retired educator, this makes my heart ache more than you can imagine!
2043	105447	@SyzygyXq @whatdivawants @Brittannnny_88 @YouDontKnowISH_ @RollingStone Since you're blaming the unvaccinated for the poor efficacy of the vaccines, do you have any proof it's not antibody dependent enhancement occuring in the vaccinated - which occured in all prior attempts to make a coronavirus vaccine?
2044	107001	"@nytimes @cmarinucci If you've gotten any other vaccinations, there's no ""religious"" excuse not to get the #COVID19 vaccine."
2045	107484	I wonder what could be causing this?  Duh.  Obviously the Vaccine IS NOT WORKING or it is causing it!
2046	106325	@dylnmcndrw @PaulAqua2 @MagicVindaloo @ToniaBuxton Hey I'm just going what the figures say. The exact same can be said for the coronavirus. Someone gets Corona virus gets killed by a car and they put that down as Corona virus. So the hell would I take a rushed vaccine for over inflated deaths. I wouldnt
2047	106974	@djnicholl This is really sad…sorry for your loss!! I just got the news sadly my cousin in his 40s just passed away from COVID in #Iraq, he did not have access to #COVID19 vaccines….everyone out their please please take the opportunity ASAP!!
2048	107521	@C_nrad @aaronsibarium If people lose confidence in government vaccine regulators, then they will stop getting *all* vaccines, not just coronavirus vaccines, and then we will have regular outbreaks of all kinds of preventable diseases.
2049	106915	Oh Captain, my Captain! Is Covid catching up to Sir Patrick enough to get people/govt to put on their fucking masks, get vaxxed, social distance, sit still, etc.
2050	105933	"I hope someone tweets to ask why I got the vaccine. I'm gonna be like, ""Umm... THE CORONAVIRUS,"" and it should really do numbers."
2051	107333	There… now everyone complaining about the vaccine not being FDA approved can stuff it, and GO GET VACCINATED.
2052	106197	So the UK government is telling me i should I get 3 maybe 4 vaccine shots to protect me against a virus so deadly that our own government is having parties whilst we are all locked down! Clearly they are not scared so why should I be!! I’ve never been more anti Covid! #COVID19
2053	107122	Why is she telling people to get the vaccine and that the vaccine doesn’t work in the same paragraph?!  Why put crap in your body that doesn’t work, but causes other issues?
2054	107096	@jimmy_dore Newsflash 🚀 😱 You can still get Covid-19 aka China Virus after getting vaccine aka gene therapy.  It is not 100% effective.
2055	105980	Mind blowing question....They have a vaccine for Covid 19.So why isn't there a vaccine for the other 5/6 Coronavirus in general circulation.Cos we know what they are?Cwor. This is a legit question.
2056	106063	First, I wish this participant, who bravely volunteered, the very best and hope they suffer no long term sequelae from this. Second, this is why we need trials. Exactly. This. #CovidVaccine
2057	107656	@LozzaFox We do not need a vaccine. We have a safe treatment that has proved 100% successful... it’s called Hydroxychloroquine
2058	201524	After initially being hesitant about getting the COVID-19 vaccine, I'm happy to report that I got my Pfizer booster shot today.If you're like me, then you, or someone you know is also a bit hesitant, and that's where we gotta approach the situation with patience and empathy.
2059	201560	I’m high risk and have been shielding for a year with a congenital heart condition. It took 2 letters from my cardiologist to get the vaccine this week. They never admitted the error. My doctor said I should have been in the first round of those to receive it. #nhsfail
2060	107598	@JustinTrudeau @jjhorgan You see this??? This is how it is suppose to be! Now get to it and follow suit. Quit being power hungry 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡#NoVaccinePassportsAnywhere
2061	105288	At 6.30am this morning the first person in the UK recieved the Covid-19 vaccine. Hopefully this is the beginning of the end of the pandemic. Good luck to Margaret Keenan and everyone else getting the vaccine in the next weeks and months 🙏
2062	105485	I am not an anti-vaxxer as I consider the Sabin and Salk polio vaccines to be one of the greatest achievements in human history). However, I don't trust the efficacy of these rushed vaccines for Covid when there has never been a successful vaccine for any Coronavirus. /1
2063	107063	What an idiot. Treating someone for a virus before they actually have the virus doesn't make any sense. Treatments for coronavirus do not give you immunity to the coronavirus in the future - that takes a vaccine.
2064	106966	@PWZambino @GOPLeader If there wasn't new variants of the flu there would be no need for an annual flu shot. We can't get ahead of the coronavirus any more than the flu. A true vaccine would only protect us from one variant not others that become immune to the vaccine.
2065	107502	If the vaccines work then why does and approved vaccinated American need to stay in Canada for 15 days?
2066	106609	@Law09804159 @Wanda2116 @NBCNews (5) It’s theoretically possible but sadly because there isn’t much demand, there is little funding for it. If HIV became a same destructive scale of Covid-19 global pandemic, a vaccine would’ve been developed.  For cancer, you can’t make a vaccine because
2067	106636	Waiting for @thegreatleader8 to make a statement about the #coronavirus. What can we do to protect the children? Do the vaccines work, or just an excuse for gov to control our minds? Is this revenge from the Chinese? Is it too late for us?
2068	107576	As someone in a Covid-19 vaccine clinical trial that won't conclude for 2 more YEARS, Trump's continued claims that a vaccine will be released in the next few weeks or months is how do you say... La foutaise...
2069	107393	If I didn't have to get groceries I'd never leave my house till we had a vaccine for #covid19.  I can't even describe the fear I feel when I do.
2070	107487	Trump: Millions Of Americans Getting COVID-19 Is ‘Terrific’ And A ‘Powerful Vaccine’The president seemed to suggest the U.S. is approaching herd immunity. It’s not.
2071	107064	@CoventryGhost @gameOFshane @PalmerReport Recovering from COVID-19 doesn't give you permanent immunity. I have an antivaxxer nephew who has had it 3 times now. It's doing him long term damage but he is still stubbornly refusing the vaccine. Good luck.
2072	105549	"I was offered the COVID-19 vaccine today by my employer to avoid wastage (I work in the public sector). I was surprised when they actually offered it to ""anyone who would like it"", and didn't ram it down people's throats and make them feel immoral for not wanting it 😏🙂"
2073	105451	Waiting for the Coronavirus Vaccine so that everyone Could have a normal life like it used to be before. God bless.
2074	107615	Today is the one year anniversary of creating the Moderna vaccine. &lt;0.5% of the US population has received any vaccine. We need to do better.
2075	105652	#margaretkeenan is a very brave lady and lovable granny. I pray all goes well after being the first recipient of this jab. Who is next? I propose that the whole cabinet go after Maggie and then the Royals. This is to give us confidence in this #vaccine #COVID19
2076	106919	I had a tetanus two years ago but ill never have this poison so am I vaccine hesitant  shouldn't habe that either as nothing was going to happen after I cut my leg. It healed very nicely w my own immune system
2077	105245	@WebMD This is nonsense. There are vaccines and treatments for the flu. Hopefully, there will be one for COVID-19 by December. These scare tactics help no one, especially since the overwhelming majority of the country is still living in isolation and struggling with depression.
2078	107466	@FaceTheNation @ScottGottliebMD @WhiteHouse I’m thinking speed is not the most important element when it comes to developing a vaccine for the coronavirus. I’m thinking maybe safety? Efficacy? Just throwing it out there.
2079	106878	@Sue76329293 @CascianoJeri @mariapaolarj @joerogan SARS-COV-2 Covid is a coronavirus, so are some cold viruses. Humans do not build robust lasting immunity to coronaviruses. You can and will catch them again and again. No vaccine protects anyone from any disease 100%.
2080	105772	Some people think the mere raising of a question is a refutation, or a dismissal, or an attack on an idea. Detailed answers sometimes require deep expertise. This thread explores why we might have a #COVID19 vaccine long before one for HIV, SARS &amp; MERS. Good thread!
2081	105427	Exactly why it needs to stop being called a vaccine!! It’s a shot just like the flu shot. It doesn’t stop you from catching it or passing it on but it does help your body fight it if one does contract COVID. Really think more folks would get it if it was properly marketed.
2082	106624	Pence is saying we’re gonna have a vaccine soon. Why did we wait till early 2020 to start working on one when the virus was rampant in China in 2019? Why dismantle the pandemic task force? Why call it a hoax at first? #Mismanagement of #coronavirus #VPDebate #VPDebate2020
2083	105832	@tunkuv @asymmetricinfo “universal vaccines will also target proteins found in the core of the virus which are far less likely to mutate” and “We don’t necessarily claim it will be a pan-coronavirus vaccine, but it has got the potential to be so simply because of where it is targeted.” aren’t definitive
2084	106447	@IvankaTrump @DailySignal I'm more interested in your discovery of a vaccine for Coronavirus. How's that coming?  Sorry, you're probably too busy getting trademarks for the masks you're having made in China. My bad.
2085	105884	Being awake while they pulled out the food and breathing tubes is a feeling I’ll never forget. This wasn’t COVID-19 related so I can’t imagine the long-term toll a respiratory disease like this will take on someone’s body… fuck this absolute shit man. Please get vaxxed
2086	107146	@edcokpareke @Advocat78311031 @jiranma @hitRECordJoe Sars yes, influenza no... wow... this is what we're dealing with... and no we haven't successfully made a vaccine for a coronavirus before. Not even hard to research. Seconds is all it would have taken you. Unbelievable.
2087	105483	If you haven’t figured this out yet…masks first, vaccinations next. This is nothing more than a preparation for vaccinating children. Letting kids go maskless would only prove they don’t need this vaccine, so keep them masked until they can vaccinate them.
2088	105524	Then we will see how loyal Donald Trump's followers are to him. I mean they're willing to catch covid-19 and die from that why not be the first one to get the vaccine. It's only right.
2089	107219	Viruses as we have been taught to understand them don’t exist and the colds and flus we can get is a natural process our bodies go through usually once or twice a year. So why do they really want us all to have flu jabs while forcing us to wear masks in the summer? I know why
2090	106347	An absolute disgrace. Fed and NSW governments deserve very heavy scrutiny for how they let this happen - how getting a vulnerable community like this vaxxed wasn’t a priority, MONTHS ago, is beyond me. Woeful stuff.
2091	105503	People will legit do coke with no hesitation but when it comes to a life saving tested vaccine it's an issue??? OK
2092	105382	Once vaccines roll out, it’s super important to keep track of WHICH vaccine you get! DO NOT MIX DIFFERENT VACCINES!!!

2094	106674	still my fellow Americans!4. I don't get the flu vaccine because...(in regards to coronavirus) I don't want to increase my chances of getting an upper respiratory illness including 4 strains of coronavirus by 36%.

2097	105411	Roy Blunt lies! Republicans passed a 3 Trillion budget that Americans did not even get a little. They misappropriated funds for Veterans families they got zip! Covid19 relief is for vaccines so all people can get vaccines and so schools can open safely.  So people get relief

2099	107653	One of my questions I have: Is COVID-19 going to mutate like the flu does every year? Once a vaccine is developed, would it be like getting the flu shot? Or is this a one and done thing like getting the shot for chicken pox when we’re little? Do we know yet? @drsanjaygupta

2115	106891	@marty_walsh @BCYFcenters These tests yield 50% false positives - test positive for any coronavirus (i.e. if you had a cold or took the flu vaccine), and if you test positive they count anyone you were in contact with as positive as well.  They want the numbers up to keep us iving under tyranny.
2116	106637	The COVID-19 virus is a plague that can be avoided if you would only get the virus vaccine shot. But then if you want to die keep doing what you are doing ,but then all the innocent people you are taking with you. You should be put down before you kill them too.
2117	106868	It is just so depressing. Hard to get out of bed.The federal gov't is frscking up vaccine deployment.Ppl continue to not take the #coronavirus seriously. So many Americans dying.I am beyond sad. I feel hopeless.2021 isnt looking any better....

2121	106417	this is my friends mother atm, she is a nurse but doesn't trust a vaccine made within a few months... idk how to take that
2122	107043	What I'm hearing is that they didn't have access to a larger list of people to receive the vaccine.Meanwhile many have no access to it.It's a brand new vaccine.Of course no everyone would wanna go first.Stop making it out like it's not normal, when the numbers show it is.
2123	106866	My dad is finally going to get his COVID-19 vaccine this week 🥰 Now everyone close to me will be vaccinated 😭 💜 I’ve been so worried about him. A little less stressed now 🙏🏼

2130	105758	@d57heinz @real_defender @JoeBiden 40% - 70% of the population is going to get Coronavirus.Hopefully a vaccine soon.5+ million recovered 🇺🇸The vast majority of people don’t get very sick from coronavirus.Of those that do get really sick, FDA approved drugs/treatments are available.
2131	105504	@jeremyfaust I've had chronic sinusitis for years, and I currently have a sinus infection. Is it safe for me to get the COVID-19 vaccine, or should I wait until my sinuses clear (which can take weeks)?
2132	106095	Gov scientists being rolled out this morning stating that previously having #COVID19 (and having antibodies) offers, I quote, “NO PROTECTION”How, then, is a #vaccine going to change things?
2133	201594	Going to the clinic to get my covid-19 vaccine and my Spotify started to play Queen's - Another one bites the dust. Oh thank you...
2134	106274	@Bud_Doggin @Mutchy2U And to my awoke privilege I donate my COVID-19 Vaccine to a blm member......your welcome.
2135	106457	Please are scared of the coronavirus because it’s “new” and there’s no vaccine.   Influenza kills THOUSANDS each year and yet people don’t get the VACCINE available. *the vaccine keeps you alive/out of the hospital. It doesn’t keep you “safe”   Y’all need a reality check.
2136	201618	Getting my second Covid-19 vaccine today. Here’s hoping for not feeling awful after. Worth it either way though.
2137	105557	@ToLey88 @FQMule You realize we might never get a vaccine? There’s never been a vaccine for a coronavirus.
2138	106492	Here it is, The first shot of @pfizer_de /@BioNTech_Group in the UK. Hope they recover fast so that other countries get access to the vaccine as well.🤞🤞🤞
2139	106223	If we do not get the #coronavirus #vaccine to everyone we are going to find out we were lied to and the expirement was wrong.
2140	201576	I got my flu vaccine, late afternoon yesterday. After getting two Covid-19 Vaccines...iτ ωαs α вrєєʑє✌😷🤗
2141	105229	This is our biggest risk. A mutation like this but one which doesn’t respond to the vaccine. If this happens, it’s essentially back to square one, circa late 2019 and we have to start all over. Only way to avoid this is to vaccinate everyone worldwide ASAP.
2142	105922	This is crazy impressive. They're gonna overtake Latin American countries who've had access to the vaccines for months.
2143	107336	This is huge! Waiving IP protections will allow mass production of vaccines around the globe. Time to take extraordinary measures to end this pandemic. Herd immunity will only be achieved if all countries achieve it. #MedTwitter #COVID19 @CDCgov @WHO @IDSAInfo
2144	201516	@LeeGrand18 @asunderland 100 days since my first Jab42 days since my last JabMe no sick of COVID-19 only sick of people say Vaccines are bad, and they are not.Me know not Dead !!!
2145	107060	No😡😡 just no. Why would y'all force this and don't day is not gonna be forced because the next step will be. This seems wrong and Yang shouldn't be accepting this. So in order for y'all greedy ass country to pay y'all they wanna do it through getting paid to take a vaccine!!!!
2146	106440	It's brilliant!!! Think about it... people with a functional brain would never accept a vaccine especially without proper testing, sheeple on the other hand will flock to their vaccine savior... problem solved!
2147	106920	"@daniel_debunker @ildfluer @OBAHIANO4 @TelGlobalHealth @niccijsmith I already had Covid. I have antibodies and Tcell immunity. Even Fraudci admits in the emails that you get antibodies naturally. The ""vaxx"" is a gene therapy. Not a true vaccine. There is no Covid19 in this vaccine. It's under study until 2023. No thanks."

Sports are postponed across the world. The new term #SocialDistancingNow all because of this disease.Take it seriously until it's contained.
2149	107454	IQ level as low as room Temperature of these Pakis. It's an invitation to Paki guinea pigs from China for human vaccine trials and the pigs are elated as if they are getting the vaccines. Hahaha.  These slaves deserve China as masters. Celebrate bibi.
2150	105818	Guess what, you will have to prove you’ve had the vaccine to attend, then it will be to ride public transport, to fly the list will go on
2151	105429	Anything’s possible. I do tend to believe in human messy error and the filthy Wuhan bat market before I believe conspiracy- just because the people we’re up against are so DUMB, but then again Bill Gates &amp; wife are all over it, pledging money toward vaccine.
2152	105401	Everyone will have be 💉with a vaccine that doesn’t stop you getting covid or stop you spreading it🙃 - another way for the government to persuade the younger generation to get the 💉
2153	105606	Know-How it Spreads1. There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19).2. The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.3. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
2154	201766	My father passed away due to #COVID19 in April. Today my mother is getting the first jab of her #Pfizer #vaccine which is hopefully the beginning of the end of this nightmare. I am incredibly grateful to the scientists who have enabled this and to the #NHS
2155	105588	@spotted_model Even if a vaccine for COVID-19 is developed, many Americans will probably refuse to take it. Something is broken.
2156	107391	@GavinNewsom This requirement is nazi style,watching  history repeats itself….Unvaccinated people are being discriminated and bullied everywhere.There is no freedom or speech, can’t talk or question Covid-19 vaccines, you will get erased…because there is only one option given-get vaccinated
2157	105698	Let's try this. Instead of a swear box, every time you want to go out for an all-night bender during a pandemic, put that cash in a box for a huge party when we have a vaccine and can safely get together again. (Or better yet, support your local restaurants doing take-out)
2158	106367	@Derridian @Wendy_Bacon @smh first business will be to privatise any #coronavirus vaccine our labs produce, for multinational profit .. then put all pensioners etc onto Twiggy's Indue card .. and probably set up some mega databases of private medical information to mine for electoral purposes #coronavirus
2159	106523	Just seen Mike Pence on TV after he took the COVID vaccine, and it looks like he's aged about 10-20 years in the face.I want to keep my good looks so if that's a side effect of taking it then fuck the vaccines. #COVID19 #coronavirus
2160	106212	The report is of concern because it suggests that immunity to the coronavirus may last only a few months in some people. And it has implications for vaccines being developed for the virus.
2161	105391	@GeorgeTakei Due to my white privilege I will be donating my covid-19 vaccine to someone less fortunate. No need to thank me just doing my part.
2162	105461	@BTone2020 @beverly_road @StephenMangan It’s a combo of extreme resources (money and minds) put on finding a vaccine plus, coronavirus’ are known so it’s not like they started completely from scratch to start with.
2163	107334	@Naija_PR WahalaI believe in Jesus Christ but truly know covid19 is real and God has given us vaccine so you telling not to take it... Where were in lockdown? Nigerians please take vaccine and be safe God will not do that for you...
2164	105714	"@dranthonyf Why is no one describing how difficult it's going to be to distribute and store the newer coronavirus vaccines because the ""cold chain"" requires ultra-cold refrigeration (-20C and -70C)? What CVS has these types of refrigerators?"
2165	105324	Lockdowns “SLOW” the spread but can never STOP the spread. When they lockdown it’s actually “slowing” herd immunity. That’s why Big Pharma needed to slow it down, so they could get blessing for a covid19 vaccine of a virus that seemed to linger. But wouldn’t happen otherwise

2168	106253	Love this! If it helps one more person decide to get vaccinated then it’s done a great job! #VaccinesSaveLives
2169	107235	@JamieWoodhouse @susautorecycltd @chrischirp The UK pop has 93% antibodies. If the vaccines work NPIs are pointless. If they don't work (and despite decades of research, no coronavirus vaccine has ever worked) then NPIs are pointless, especially if R0 of omicron is much higher. The arrogance of thinking we can affect it...!
2170	107313	If you need 4 shots a year of this crap, can we just all admit it isn’t a vaccine and it doesn’t work?
2171	106200	We should stop pretending the vaccines are 100% safe and risk free for all.They trigger immune system responses *by design* and you don’t know how your immune system will react until you get the shot.Thus this is a risk calculation for anyone.I will keep wearing my kn95s.
2172	105839	@ShaunLintern @WhackyRacesPP Also. We've tried to make Coronavirus vaccines before, with no success. And all of a sudden, everybody can make a successful one. Even a company that's never made a vaccine before (Moderna) amazingly develops a successful vaccine. It all sounds too good to be true...
2173	106350	This is not a flu 🤧. Covid-19 is the grim reaper comin’ for ya 💀.  The vaccine 💉 is free and available. If you can still make the choice you have time to get the vaccine. Life or death (☀️ or 💀)?  🤔 #GetVaccinated #VaccinesSaveLives
2174	106573	@Scott40128166 @DrTomFrieden How do they detect the delta variant? Has it been isolated? Has COVID-19 been isolated? How do u create a vaccine for a substance you cannot isolate?
2175	105321	@KFLAPH and so should we. Especially with @FordNation getting rid of mandates everywhere. I will not feel safe to get any medical care now that mandates for HCW are gone. DO THE BOOSTERS for everyone. Now. Do not wait until things get bad. Do it. Toronto is.
2176	107310	These measures are designed to balance reopening while controlling the spread of COVID-19 and saving lives. We’ve come a long way, but it is still critical that we mask up, socially distance, wash our hands, and get the vaccine when it’s our turn in order to end this pandemic.
2177	107245	Dear #UPSC2020 aspirants and people demanding #PostponeUPSC_CSE I want to reach out to you guys. Just demanding a postponement arbitrarily till Dec has no logic!  genuine demand should be a coherent and clear one. No vaccine &gt; no exam. The virus has post treatment complications.
2178	201671	#IGotTheShot #CrushCOVID 72 hours after getting the vaccine all that remains is my burgeoning #COVID19 immunity and the smile I can’t wipe off my face. Thank you #science!
2179	106710	Please take a look at this.  Do you wanna get the vaccine and protect yourself from getting seriously ill , limit spread or ignore all the facts and reject the vaccine ?Be wise, be less selfish. Please take if you are able to🙏🙏

2210	106011	If you get the Covid-19 vaccine &amp; get mild flue-like symptoms, then test positive for Covid-19, it only means the vaccine is doing what it is supposed to do. All 3 vaccines, contain or produce covid-19 spike protein.  The rapid antigen test actually tests for this protein.
2211	107174	@billpeduto @ConorLambPA What can be done to make sure that the vaccine gets to the groups in the order that's been dictated?  If this is going to keep happening then throw it open to everyone.  The clinic should be held responsible here too.

2231	107257	No vaccines are 100% effective… just like if you get the flu shot and then end up getting the flu, it could be from a number of reasons such as the vaccine was for the most popular strains &amp; you caught a different strain,same with pneumonia-it can help so you don’t die from it

2246	106952	@hawawright360 Firstly there is no such thing as “the Wuhan virus” there is Covid19 - let us not stigmatise a place simply because it was the first place smart enough to pick up on a new disease. Secondly - it is unlikely that the current vaccines will lead to complete eradication but they will
2247	106341	It is safe to have the Covid-19 vaccine alongside steroid exposure, but the patient may not mount such a good immune responseDo not delay vaccination for someone who is taking, has received or is soon to receive steroids in any form (IM, intra-articular, oral, IV)

2259	105788	@ndykmn There are agricultural vaccines for Coronavirus. There has never been a human Coronavirus that was as much of a threat as this. There was no will to develop vaccine for SARS or MERS because they disappeared before they affected millions of people. U Sask is developing a vaccine.

2265	106918	@davidhazony Bad idea. The vaccine has a huge acceptance problem in Israel. On the other hand, there are literally millions here who would prefer to get the shot ASAP like me - because whatever the vaccines' minor risks, they pale before the health damage caused by a coronavirus infection.

2282	106967	They're gonna release a vaccine for coronavirus and everyone will fall over themselves to get it and it'll turn out to actually be some mind control thing like in Deus Ex
2283	105998	@Cheryl04148981 @MrERyter @InformedRN76 @catturd2 Yes. And this is also when people get the flu vaccine but end up with the flu anyway. It’s another strain not included in the vaccine that just shows up. Work in lab long time and we’ve had a panel of 4 coronavirus strains to test for years. Covid 19 is another strain.

2287	105545	@TexasTribune that is because you can't hide from any virus, coronavirus has been around for many years. A flu vaccine doesn't stop the flu, (common sense) is gone. Florida is open and not surge or anything. Stop being stupid

2289	106761	I think staying in and following the guidelines like the Health Department tells us to do is the only way to control this virus. Keeping more cases down so the vaccine if ever it gets to the medical doctors, it can control it. Just my 2 cent's.
2290	105967	@birmingham_live This is hardly news. #COVID19 is a novel coronavirus, like SARS. There wasn't a vaccine for SARS, just effective public health measures to eliminate its spread and threat.

2296	105699	One reason I am not that afraid of antivaxxers on the coronavirus is because I think there are going to be lots of vaccine mandates at schools, airlines, employers, etc. Anti-vaxxers are going to end up having the get the shots.

2319	106311	@Justaguefan @ToothpasteWords Yeah if HCQ worked for a stronger coronavirus in Sars, you would think it would for Covid-19. But the pharmaceuticals won't make a profit from it like they would from vaccines.

Great job Avery Travis on your news story and thanks for posting this news update on the coronavirus vaccine.
2333	106068	I keep a photo of my negative PCR results on my phone.  And I'll add my Moderna shot card when I can get the second jab.  Not everyone has easy access to 'their doctor'.  Do private practice clinicians have access to their state's vax database, like medical groups do?

2335	106418	The #Oxford coronavirus #vaccine successfully provokes a strong immune response, an analysis has found.
2336	106844	You all need to be asking why? Why push this vaccine that only lessens symptoms and has no long term safety data. Why? What's in it?
2337	107293	@Charles_Castle_ @newzjunkey @RexChapman What gets me is how they make it out to be such a BFD, when it's not.Bad reactions to the vaccine are miniscule; bad reactions to COVID-19 are over 730,000.
2338	106741	I don't understanding why they don't say the naturally infected individuals don't need to take the vaccine and save these doses to others that need it?6 months immunity if you were infected or you took the vaccine (same).
2339	106635	Mark my words. There is a sh*t storm in humanities way when people will get vaccinated with this trial vaccine. Especially the kids will suffer in long term cases. #COVID19 #Omicron

2349	106629	@burnett_cain @riseupmelbourne They haven’t got a vaccine for the most common coronavirus in history(the common cold) yet they’ve got one for this. Are people actually swallowing this shit. In the U.K. we’ve been told the ‘second wave’ may hit this winter. Who didn’t see that coming.
2350	105811	@DerekDenhamAlan @DPrabhata @maggiemfox @jechristensen @TAWaldrop You think pneumonia can’t scar the lungs and also cause long term problems? COVID is a new coronavirus but it’s not alien technology. No one knows if there are any long term effects of the virus or the vaccine.
2351	106399	@JUANFENNSKI @BBCBreakfast @MattHancock we will get vaccine for covid-19 (to reduce symptoms only of SARS COVID-2) so no virus would be eliminated !!! what a scam!!!

2363	107172	@Jose_Freitas94 @realistgeo @KokeUSG It has nothing to do with COVID-19 and probably isn’t true in regards to any vaccine. I think at this point we can’t just believe everything we see in the internet

2365	201517	The man who got COVID last week and said it was mild *specifically because* he got vaccinated has now banned vaccine mandatesWhat an absolute fucking idiot
2366	106049	@irenegarth1946 Every person without vaccine protection is a potential incubator for a new variant! This virus is able to evolve swiftly to survive. If we want a normalised world we have to get ahead of #COVID19 not just patching up after it! We can beat it if we stop politicising it!
2367	201787	Grateful to the scientists and all involved for working so hard to produce this vaccine 👍🏽👏🏽 #MondayThoughts
2368	105255	Just got my COVID-19 vaccine. No microchip detected. Didn’t have to renounce Christ. And everyone was really nice.
2369	107136	I am starting to think there will be games again without fans after reading of so many catching Covid19 new variant at this rate we will be lucky if fans can go2games on December 26/27th.I have had my booster but it doesnt stop1 getting Covid 19 only reduces how bad you get it.🤦‍♂️
2370	106803	If they mandate #Florida kids to go back to school I am going to decline that offer. No vaccine, no school. We'll homeschool.
2371	105641	i hope this COVID-19 vaccine works with others because i’m not putting something that we’re still experimenting with, inside my body. i don’t really feel like being a human test subject.
2372	105935	They actually were going to hype Santa in their vaccine pitch( hmmm... was this just advertising for their stock investment)🤔🤔
2373	201546	@6abc @6abc the segment you just aired about the Dr. who just got the first Covid19 vaccine shot and then a few days later tested positive for Covid was completely irresponsible reporting. That Dr. did not yet develop full immunity or receive the 2nd shot... 1/3
2374	106823	I'm in favor of getting the #COVID19 vaccine, i just wish our #Governments would be honest about the side effects. Telling an alcoholic out there that the vaccine may not fully work is NOT going to encourage them to GET the vaccine. There are RIPPLES to things that you say &amp; do.
2375	106164	"@CoondogHog @ArkansasCovid This is really wrong headed.Considering that there may be no ""herd immunity"" with COVID19 we all need to do our part until there's vaccine, not just shelter those most at risk.BTW I take offense at the word weak! Fighting off cancer, being 65+, having asthma is not weak. 😣"
2376	107162	Now that we’ve vaccinated the elderly &amp; those with certain conditions, just f’ng give anyone who wants a vaccine a vaccine already. They’re just getting stale &amp; thrown out.I’m mad because I just found out my brother contracted COVID-19 so close to the end of the tunnel.
2377	201674	The Ontario government is further accelerating the second dose interval for individuals who received their first dose of an AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine to eight weeks from 12 weeks.
2378	106898	The other reason I am sharing is that there is so much misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. I am chronicling my experience so others can see the account of a person they know.
2379	107396	With #COVID19 spreading like wild fire this is the last thing we need. Rich countries should share the #vaccine with others to reach the immunity. If not we will live with this for a long time. #VaccineEquity #vaccineforall #coronavirus
2380	107515	Just imagine how many diseases would’ve been cured if academia and industry from all over the world collaborated to take on diseases such as Cancer, Alzheimer and HIV to name a few same as they’ve done with COVID-19 vaccine. Cancer will not be cured by  a research group..1/2
2381	105379	@darryn_briggs @chrislhayes It will NEVER be over.  COVID-19 is a coronavirus, and like all of its fellow coronaviruses, it is now permanently endemic.  And no, vaccines won't stop that, humans aren't the only reservoir, there are multiple animal hosts to the virus as well.
2382	201689	Ended my semester by getting my second #CovidVaccine. I am indebted to the scientists and healthcare workers who have been working so hard. Thank you to @moderna_tx and @WillCoHealth for both doses.Do your part… remember to #WearAMask and #GetVaccinated to fight #COVID19! https://t.co/IuANI7051F
2383	106634	@CBSLA It’s not a “confirmed COVID-19 case”. It’s a continued case of stupidity because some decided not to get the wildly available vaccine. All the vendors will be out cash because someone doesn’t believe in science.
2384	106904	This is my issue. I have vaccinated my daughter but this Covid-19 vaccine is very new and I am concerned about the speed it jas been produced so I will not be rushing to take it.
2385	106241	"Just wait until they start telling kids to turn in their parents for not taking them to get the jab.How many kids will use this ""threat"" to get ______?How long until CPS is called on parents who don't get their kids jabbed?Think this can't happen? History says yes it can."
2386	105282	Every time I see someone who is not a doctor, immunologist, etc. comment negatively on the COVID-19 vaccine, I’m going to figure out what they do for work and make very uneducated comments about their profession. Stay tuned.
2387	105706	Having just spent hours researching, I'm concerned there has never been a vaccine for ANY coronavirus! I did see many 'happy-talk' reports that PROMISE a vaccine but know promises usually melt away like pockets of snow.
2388	107674	Anyone want to go raid a pharmaceutical factory for the COVID-19 vaccine and give it out to hospitals for free?
2389	107520	For all the long term good your vaccines do @sajidjavid you might as well be pedalling Snake Oil. Everything seems to suggest the vaccines are actually getting in the way of natural immunity. This could come back and haunt us 😡
2390	106790	@SRomanum @BNODesk Remember there is no vaccine for the common cold (a normal Coronavirus) at all. It's been 30 years and we don't have an HIV vaccine.  There may never be a vaccine.
2391	106251	They don’t care about the biggest killer “abortion” in the black communities nor about police killing us but they somehow care ENOUGH so that we don’t die from a plandemic. If we don’t take the vaccine and everyone else does then they should be protected from us then right🤔?
2392	105510	My goodness I can’t wait until they approve #covid vaccines for children. Always nerve wracking to have my kids get covid tests when they have a runny nose. If you’re still hesitant, get #vaccinated. It’s not just for you but for the kids too young to get the vaccine. #COVID19
2393	105936	"The ""% of available"" doesn't seem like a good metric, given that vaccines are shipped in huge boluses and vaccination occurs steadily over time. They're not going to get all of a shipment injected the day it arrives and then sit around doing nothing until the next one."
2394	106129	I remember when I went to get my first dose of the vaccine and they told me to come back in a week because they “had no stock”
2395	105487	"If you can't sue an industry that has zero liability...Who do we get to sue if we have a ""bad reaction,"" to this vaccine that was rushed through testing and can't possibly have been studied long enough to know any long term side effects, and particularly any reproductive risks?"
2396	105932	So prisoners are getting vaccines before proper civilians...so I'm thinking if you get arrested for not wearing a mask, you might get vaccinated...#COVID19 #COVIDSecondWave
2397	107309	even if the vaccine worked as intended, Covid was more deadly and there were 0 risk it would still be immoral to mandate it. This isn't something I'm willing to compromise on, I decide my own risk tolerance, the government does not get to do it for me. #COVID19
2398	106879	I really would love to know how many Americans are going to take the coronavirus vaccine? I’ll say a prayer for you! They’ll try to inject your kids while they are at school. WARN YOUR KIDS NOT TO TAKE ANY SHOTS IN SCHOOL. THEY WILL LIE TO YOUR KIDS TO INJECT THEM
2399	201555	My entire family got vaccinated in a week's time as soon as the vaccine reached my locality. Couldn't be prouder to be an Indian. Thank you @narendramodi ji❤️ @balbir59 @ramnikmann @COVIDNewsByMIB #COVID19 #Covishield #vaccine
2400	106210	What I really need now is to become wealthy, do you have a vaccine against poverty (POVAX-21) 😁😆😁 This another free humour!

2402	201677	@LizzyKiane @blankslate2017 @washingtonpost @Rick_Neal The side effects for me were mild. I needed to get the booster and had no side effects at all. #GetVaccinatedNow don’t wait. My sister’s entire family is #Vaxxed and they all got #COVID19 but their symptoms were mild. My dad was #Unvaccinated and he died of #COVID in March.
2403	105394	@HFarhat3 @fifimurray2 The part where you refuse to take the COVID-19 vaccine. I feel like this isn't hard to understand. You might not like the label, but you're still an antivaxxer.
2404	107575	If Harvard opts out, kiss the Ivy League goodbye until the coronavirus vaccine is found.Being a conference that believes more in academics and science than athletics, if Harvard opts out of winter sports, the rest of the Ivy League will follow suit.
2405	107304	This is why getting your vaccine is so important, folks.  We can save lives.#ThisIsOurShotWI #BrighterTomorrow2022
2406	106081	In the middle of the protests everyone forgot about coronavirus. Soon the second wave of coronavirus will be announced and they will put everyone on even more strict lock-down and then vaccinate everyone. #coronavirus #COVID19 #vaccine
2407	106580	We need to band together and fight off this virus like we did the British.Our best weapon is the Vaccine and wartime patriotism. I've already got 2 SHOTS in my arm.I'm part of The Herd 🇺🇸Who's with me? 🙌
2408	106812	@SteveDeaceShow @Happy_Hunter58 Exactly right, the vaccine is for the vulnerable; not everyone! This has been turned in a weapon of fear like masks that don’t work. #COVID19
2409	105376	@RudyGiuliani We know you are owned Rudy. Warp speed had nothing to do with COVID-19 vaccine (pathetic to try and rename it in such a racist way) development. WS is responsible for distribution only and that's not going well is it? Your time is coming Rudy and your corruption will be known!
2410	106663	So @BillGates will take the coronavirus vaccine publicly on camera but some loser anti-vaxxers like Haifa Wehbe and Carol Samaha  speak against it. Maybe they should stick to gold digging in Egypt.
2411	105562	#COVID19  You either shut down person to person contact or you develop a vaccine, or you take the #Republicans approach. Sacrifice american lives to keep the economy going and hope it goes away on it's own.
2412	105470	My teacher spouse and I are vaxxed and boosted, my elder kid is vaxxed but my 3 year old isn't so jokes on him, right?
2413	107291	@bidenWinning @ABC Because idiot, those are actually vaccines for deadlier diseases. This is a quickly made up placebo to try and control people. They can't and won't force them on flu shots. Well guess what, seasonal flu is A FUCKIN CORONAVIRUS.
2414	105404	"The #covid19 situation in my confused head:""You should stay home, but then don't if you want (which you should), but go out because work, since this a really dangerously harmless fatal desease actually for our economy. We have vaccines now. You're unemployed. Get vaccinated."""
2415	107387	them have died? Vaccines work, but nothing is 100% perfect, never has been. Those who choose not to get vaccinated, remember if you get sick it is no ones fault but your own. If you get Covid19 and infect a love one who isn't vaccinated the result is on you.  We are3/4

2417	105944	Too much suppression may mean not enough herd immunity so suppression will continue until morale improves/vaccine is widely available.
2418	107448	@AngrierWHStaff Do you believe the coronavirus vaccine timing is political? Do you think the FDA will tow the line or put their foot down if it's not ready?
2419	106186	@narendramodi Hello SHRI NARENDRA MODI, My Name is Rohit Sadhoo, I am 14 year old boy requesting for a Covid-19 Vaccine that can be given to childrens. I am saying because after doing several online classes ,I want to attend my classes In my school, so please give vaccines to childrens.
2420	106851	I’m not a medical professional so I defer to med professionals on issues like this. My wife is a medical professional so I subsequently know many people in the field.The arguments I’ve heard against young healthy people taking the vaccine outweigh the arguments for taking it.
2421	201714	Got vaccinated &amp; feeling grateful to #NHS #astrazeneca #MaryleboneGP #TheUniversityofOxford All went smoothly, well organised from registering to getting vaccinated. A beautiful &amp; historical location too - had my Covid19 jab next to Shakespeare’s sculpture in #WestminsterAbbey ! https://t.co/PU3tuNELy2
2422	201637	I had my flu vaccine and looking forward to my COVID-19 booster as I'm 28 weeks pregnant 🤰and want to protect me and my baby👶 and enjoy the last bit of pregnancy, rather than be ill #ImmunityBoosted
2423	105769	Dude, we're not going to defeat CovidWe're just going to get vaccinated and protect ourselves as best we canUntil a variant comes along that goes around the vaccineBecause IDIOTS WON'T WEAR MASKS OR GET SHOTS
2424	105344	I trust the President!  The vaccine we all need to worry about is the one Bill Gates has been working on for 20 years and coordinating with China.
2425	106285	@davidkurten What do you think vaccines do? Seeing as the 131,000 people who have died of Covid-19 in the UK also had immune systems, why do you think trusting one's immune system is an argument against getting vaccinated?
2426	107231	Graham says - Get the vaccine, if you don’t want to die, very simple. However, Graham STILL won’t confess he supported evil DT LIES about the election. Psalms 101:7“No one who practices deceit   shall dwell in my house;no one who utters lies  shall continue before my eyes.”
2427	107627	@AnthonyNBC12 4 or 5 I think?  And got my 2nd Pfizer vaccine yesterday.  But still gonna wear the mask(s) and test as needed. #coronavirus
2428	105442	This is so critical given our current predicament (no organized plan in the U.S.) &amp; unreal effort it'll take to globally scale a vaccine. Trace, test, isolate to get cases low (did not happen in U.S.); develop therapies to speed recovery, reduce mortality; vaccine to prevent.
2429	106018	Question:Why does the president show no interest in taking the vaccine jab?This could have really inspired the rest of the population on COVID-19 vaccines.Is there something we don't know?Have you noticed the bigwigs no longer mask up?
2430	106872	People saying the #coronavirus is going to be gone in May are delusional. We are just going to have more tests, hospital beds, and preventative measures in place. This will not end until we have a vaccine.
2431	107188	If you get any of these vaccines there's a 100% (+-) chance that you will survive a coronavirus infection.
2432	107328	#Sinopharm uses one of the 'classic' #vaccine techniques, with an inactivated #CoronaVirus. Q: where did they get all that virus material from?
2433	107455	No it's not stunning. As a person who watched their dumbass governor fumble the initial response to COVID-19 and then be re-elected just in time to fumble the vaccine roll-out, it's not stunning. Having to deal with the death cult GOP's stronghold on my state is terrible
2434	107226	Except there's no vaccine yet, so how they know the size of the stockpile is anybody's guess...It's because they're lying. That's it. That's the guess.
2435	201602	Dear Covid-19 deniers/Anti-Vax Mob, I am going to get my booster vax because I have a mind of my own.Sincerely,Julia A ChandlerPS: Screw you.
2436	107216	@NHSuk Next it will be.... NHS Coronavirus Vaccine - Let's get vaccinated for Coronavirus, let's get back to foreign holidays and work.
2437	107380	"👍👍 if it's effective as the admin want to put it, there would be no need to force people to take it. the manufacturers have conspired with Governments all over the world to use people as guinea pigs for this COVID-19 vaccine. it  ""will take years and failures"" to develop it."
2438	106346	@sarashallx @MonicaGandhi9 What brakes? This is a very new field and it's not going to end anytime soon. I'm hearing universal coronavirus vaccine, and cancer vaccine development. Now I have every reason to root for a cancer vaccine, but if they're going to be this pushy for all of them... no thanks.
2439	105658	@ShaneGrover2 @truthqst @TheLastSquatch @RealCandaceO Ok so do you get a seasonal flu shot?  I hope not because there is less data in each annual flu vaccine than 15+ months of Covid-19 vaccine.
2440	106313	We all need to work together to protect the world from #COVID19. Will @g20org states please step up and release much needed funds for response efforts to @WHO @CEPIvaccines and @gavi? Together, we can beat this pandemic.
2441	106655	@mhdksafa I fully understand mRNA vaccination and I fully understood the all out efforts made to developing the COVID-19 vaccine. I am 58 yo and I am an  bc educator in a 1900+ student school. As soon as my state made my group eligible, I registered for my vaccination. I’m still preaching!

2444	105890	@JKJAVMY Please considerate on getting all these foreign workers to receive their vaccine in 1 or 2 specific PPV, or else, letting their own country embassy to take care of it. The COVID-19 situation would be ugly if all PPVs open for foreign workers as well. Thanks.
2445	107641	My sincere hope is that Cuba will make their COVID-19 vaccine available to the world in every possible way: Producing it themselves, sharing the knowledge needed to produce it, and helping set up production everywhere it can possibly be made.
2446	107493	In my novel Antigenesis, the MC, an epidemiologist, ends up needing to raise her infant granddaughter. And now I worry about this in real life. Everyone is fine right now, but until we get a vaccine, I'm going to be a wreck.#writing

2448	201676	Yesterday I worked at the vaccination centre, so nice to see so many happy people eager to get their COVID-19 vaccine. Some this was their first outing since March 2020!
2449	105724	@200belligerents @ZubyMusic In the UK we have reached a point where most people know someone who has died, or has long long term illness. It is not a trivial illness. Relative to the risks from COVID19, the vaccine is very safe indeed. Despite all that, no one is being forced to take the vaccine.
2450	107158	@starsandstripes Will there be a vaccine for the new strain of coronavirus?  I mean, it’s a virus, and they do mutate, just like influenza.
2451	106829	South Africa is not a poor nation and shouldn't get #coronavirus vaccines donations like countries like Zimbabwe. Our economy is too big to be in this situation. Our government is not competent. That is where the biggest problem is
2452	107195	Following the news that a coronavirus vaccine is 90% effective, would you get the vaccine? I’m interested to see your responses and reasons, so if you’re yes or no let me know your thoughts!
2453	105452	@thievinganc @pierredevos @MRCza @DrZweliMkhize Mkhize is gambling with our lives, and in a functional state he would be tried for contravening the Coronavirus regulations and guidelines. He had to be reminded to act on procuring the vaccine like it was not to logical next step.
2454	105328	Considering people with highly allergic reactions shouldn't take the Pfizer vaccine, what can folks like me take? @ASlavitt, is there any word on an alternative for the allergic among us? As someone with asthma as well, I'd like to know what's safe/is Moderna my answer? Thanks!
2455	107624	@russellbrandom @jstephencarter @ConceptualJames And you’re ignoring that the viruses you mentioned don’t have animal reservoirs like COVID-19 and influenza. Viruses with AR can go host in other species , mutate, and come back as a new variant and render your vaccine useless. It’s my we have the flu every year, but not polio et
2456	107535	I'm listen to BBC World Service idiot doctor on saying the only way across the world they can control the virus is with the vaccine but we have been told categorically does not stop you catching coronavirus and does not stop you spreading it so he's talking out of his ass

2458	106822	@atlaspurred @sander7211 @eugyppius1 We still don't have a 100% effective vaccine for humans for ANY coronavirus. This is why the Gates foundation has funded the Universal Flu vaccine, as an attempt to help wipe it out. You have to look at SARS Cov-2 and remember it's not smallpox. You aren't going to knock it out

2463	107135	@Woodhead85 @The_DogWalker @JayMitchinson We were fortunate that if we had to have a pandemic, it would be a coronavirus, something a first year med student would learn about. Tonnes of research had already gone on into SARS and MERS and specifically a MERS jab. Cancer is a wide and varied field, this was one big target.
2464	107331	This is starting to convert me into an @ATabarrok disciple on drug/vaccine approvals. Why do we have to wait till May for this in the U.S.? (Has seemingly fewer adverse reactions than Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer too)

We have NO vaccine, and NO definitive test or treatment for coronavirus yet. You like to play Russian Roulette?
2472	105543	@FuflunsPW @chrischirp That’s the interesting bit.  Cold virus have remained prevalent so the NPIs effective for flu less effective for colds and Covid - both coronavirus.Is it the flu vaccine that makes the difference.  Doesn’t really explain the 0.0% in surveillance in normally peak weeks.
2473	105281	@DrSamGirgis I don't believe we know enough about COVID-19 to have an effective vaccine. I'll rely on my immune system until more is known. Anyone know where I can get a black market COVID-19 vaccine certificate so I can go back to work? 😎
2474	106060	Part 59 in our #Covid19 vaccine drama. So. The absent father has now filed two fresh motions against us. One, to remove the chile from us for abuse because we vaxxed the kid. Two, to prevent the second vax. He already lost this in court but he won’t give up. 1/2 #NewMexico
2475	105307	@Av8tor172 @IngrahamAngle It works for Malaria and Rheumatism but probably not for Covid19. So if everyone buys this shit what happens with the people who really need it? You get the problem right? You don't want a new vaccine tested on yourself but you want to use a drug without clinical testing?
2476	106422	@HughGnu yer i dont know past my pay grade twitter ple what is a vaccine ?? are what we are calling vaccines re #COVID19 true vaccines is it like the drugs you take to prevent aids once you get hiv or is like the measles vaccine should we calling these things vaccines ?

2482	107252	@FireyTopaz @politico Nah. Everyone could wear a mask and Coronavirus would still spread like it is. The masks either work or they don't, just like the vaccines.
2483	105592	@PinkSkyMagazine @CaraMia200 Will there be room for discussion when they come up with a vaccine for Coronavirus? Are you really going to say no?
2484	106718	@ChillinskyKris @CharlieViggiano @RealCandaceO @WholeFoods Influenza has a vaccine.  Coronavirus does not.  That's the difference.  If it spreads to everyone, everyone gets sick.  If you get the flu, but you also had your vaccine, you'll be fine.
2485	107129	“We failed on the social science.” Who would’ve thought a safe and effective vaccine wouldn’t be attractive to 30% of the population?
2486	106478	#covid19 If a healthcare workers can go to work, COVID positive why do you mandate a vaccine to protect the patients when you are allowing the health care workers to knowingly expose patients to the virus?
2487	201597	Got my Covid booster yesterday. Feel cruddy today, so my body's been fooled into thinking I have Covid (again), and defending me. Go, antibodies! Can say from experience it's still a lot better than actually having Covid, and will be over much faster.#COVID19 #vaccinated
2488	201600	My Granny had her first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine today and honestly I'm the happiest I've been since March
2489	107189	That’s the news we are all hoping for... except for stocks like zoom and peleton ... everyone else is feeling this 😂 low key I’m going to wait on the vaccine until version 2.0 comes out.
2490	106862	@drdavidsamadi @Shanesoup1 So I have given up on getting people to stop taking vaccines. I won’t take one but I can help them and their kids get safe ones! We must help the world pivot to non mRNA no spike@protein traditionally made vaccines like #Covaxin it is @WHO approved with 150mdoses w/o side effects
2491	106830	Absolutely.  Vaccines in general are no good.  But, to rush it then try to force it people is scary.  They won't find out til later that there are problems and terrible side effects from the vaccine.  Not to mention, Bill Gates is pushing it...THAT is terrifying!
2492	106927	Clownish, yes, but it's also an important insight into how the media works in 2021.They're not going into that press conference with Murphy chasing a story on botched vaccine distribution or a nursing home death coverup.Their editors want clickbait. They're there to get it.
2493	107176	@JandJFlowers @phossils @TommyMacDC @Nike @Kaepernick7 That is not true! Now there is an effective vaccine out there. Anyone who does not take the vaccine and dies of covid-19 did in fact take responsibility for their own death. Those who discourage others from vaccines are strait up killers.
2494	105896	@WrestleTalk_TV Everybody's in ring career should be over. #coronavirus is going to lead to extinction and entertainment &amp; sporting events are only going to spread it. Vaccine won't save us. Only permanent isolation. It is the key! #BanAllSports#BanAllEntertainment
2495	107593	Unfortunately COVID-19 will get worse because it will gain more strength along with the flu in the winter according to Dr. Fauci, but I hope the vaccine is distributed to people who want it including me because I don't want to get the virus, and spread it to other people
2496	107243	Mid-way through my (vaccinated) bout of COVID-19 my take aways are;- Don't underestimate this virus.- Don't overestimate the vaccine.
2497	106412	This is one of reason why my body does not need drugs and chemicals like #vaccines because it can't assimilate with the human body.Take care of body by eating healthy foods it will take of you without you even noticing.
2498	201629	Consider I live with my grandparents and parents (high risk) &amp; I have 3y/o kid. Of Iz I need my vaccine to protect my loved ones. Sebab tu bila gov bukak je AZ 1.0 - I never listened to MakTeh or any conspiracy theories/antivax group, i straightaway booked for all my families.
2499	106926	Folks..understand this..the Coronavirus Vaccine will work..whether you take it or not..the vaccine’s main purpose..will be to allow the media and Democrats to almost immediately stop pretending the shutdown were needed. They were not!
2500	105655	@ChuckWendig Pneumonia is the worst... I've had it twice in the last 5 years... Begged my doctor to give me the vaccine and she will not do it until I'm over 55.
2501	105795	Getting covid in December was my vaccine,  he got the vaccine and still got covid,  and has to quarantine, so tell me, what the hell is the point of getting the vaccine? What's the point?
2502	106542	Nice content and gives a good clarity with all these vaccine options that are out there or soon to be out there.
2503	107107	@ty16097410 @HansDancin @AdamSchefter No the purpose of the vaccines is expose you to elements of the coronavirus so you can build up certain antibodies against the actual contraction of the coronavirus. Yes if you do get the vaccine It may lessen the effects. Truth: we don’t know it’s new virus to the human genome!
2504	106351	We’ve had SARS and MERS before and to my knowledge we couldn’t develop effective vaccines for those. Why is Covid-19 different even though it is a SARS type virus?Or am I wrong here?Thanks!
2505	105413	@David67468668 Hi,I’ve performed a funny stand-up comedy about coronavirus and vaccine that made us to stay at home. It’s second post. I hope you enjoy itIf tou like please subscribe♥️
2506	201591	I recently got my #COVID19 Vaccine, which got me thinking - is the Vaccine the end of COVID?My wish for 2021 is for everyone to join me in getting the Vaccine ASAP. I would like to thank @cjwmedical for their efforts of immunizing community physicians. #VaxTheNation @ChenMed https://t.co/vlPS1Qm4Ql
2507	107106	@khadijabatool98 Since the new coronavirus variant has just showed up, vaccines have become doubtful too
2508	107077	@baltimoresun Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
2509	107186	@KennyPresley7 @ladeyla @RealCandaceO And for the record, they never claimed you couldn't get covid19 once fully vaccinated it even states that in the vaccine paperwork ,  nothing is 100% not even bleach. Do better research is all I gotta say. It helps protect u from dying due to it or being hospitalized
2510	201744	I have friends screeching at me that the vaccine is going to alter my DNA. I just tell them I hope I get superpowers.
2511	106227	@errolbsk Even today since first coronavirus family.Sars MERS.. There wasn't any successful vaccine development... This won't be exception.... Treatment will be best bet.
2512	107413	Vaccine conundrum🤔😌:How many vaccines can a human body handle?;A flu vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine every year?. Vaccine works only 50% (pure chance?);If a new virus pops up next year, another vaccine?;Why no vaccine for HIV AIDS??.....something wrong here?🙄😔👍🏼
2513	105749	It will be voluntary, but I you haven't had it you will have to wear a mask when in public until you get the vaccine, they can't force you to get it, but they can and will withhold services if you don't get it..... The Liberal Way !!
2514	107630	"It's because they tested these things beforehand. But people decided ""they rushed it out"" is the narrative because they choose to ignore everything that happened before the vaccine rollout. Like, how coronavirus was being studied before the 2019 variant happened."
2515	105968	@BillGates We've survived virus before Coronavirus and we'll survive the viruses of the future. PS.. how's the vaccine coming for SARs virus, you know the so called deadly pandemic from 2002!?, still working on it?.
2516	107292	I am seriously so happy to be able to cheer on so many friends getting their first and second COVID-19 vaccine shots. If I missed celebrating with you, please accept this blanket YAY!!!!!!!!
2517	107623	WHO Coronavirus Special Envoy says vaccine is unlikely to save this. Thoughts from the science-startup world @matt_barrie ? Any reasonable hope there of a vaccine?!
2518	105736	The medical people that are leaving their jobs because they won't get the Vaccine shots then charge the people a hundred a week for a COVID-19 test if I want to cross the border it's a hundred Canadian coming back it's 300.00 American and another 100.00 Canadian per person.
2519	201748	MT @ResisterSis1 ”volunteers who received the vaccine made more neutralizing antibodies than have been seen in most patients who have recovered from Covid-19. But a second injection, four weeks after the first, was required before the vaccine produced a dramatic immune response.”
2520	105443	@joelpollak  I don't understand, Biden has ads saying he would take care of coronavirus. But, everything he lists that he would do like speed up vaccine etc, Trump has already done. Trump and media should press Biden specifics on this what exactly he would do different.
2521	106924	Encourage everyone to search for this video.  Twitter blocking video because they don't want us knowing the truth.  Key: Learn Why the 1986 Vaccine Protection Act Does Not Protect Covid-19 Injections76,621 viewsMay 5, 2021
2522	105900	I’m a fairly greedy Capricorn &amp; I would turn this down. It’s not that I don’t want the vaccine. It’s that I don’t want one 2 seconds after it’s distributed. What’s wrong with that?
2523	106192	We are never going back to normal until these despots are removed. The vaccine will be used a bribe, but, as usual, they will lie and kick the can down the road yet again.

2525	107586	Y r we not buying Oxford, Pfizer or Moderna Vaccine. Y we r after a vaccine which is in its phase third trial and has not proven to be of any substantial Efficacy.
2526	105643	@KCStar @RogerMarshallMD Yes, this covid19 is looking and acting a lot like the regular old corona virus that has been around 200+ years.  They change about every 2.5 months and so a vaccine with not keep up with it never.  Immunity is really people just getting less sick if they were already infected.
2527	106012	California will qualify you for a $1.5M lottery if you take the vaccine. How long before the state gets sued by someone with an adverse reaction or the death of a family member.
2528	106896	Would be a shame if your reproductive system was affected by vaccine and you planned on having more kids. They haven't had the time to test these affects yet because it is experimental. I want my kids to be able to have kids. Only leftists want to control what others do.
2529	106082	Small Pox, Polio, and MMR vaccines could not be reached for comment.I'd agree with her but we don't have capitalism in the US.We give the 1% socialism when it fucks up (bailouts) or just for shits/giggles.
2530	105331	I got the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine yesterday, and 24 hours in to my pleasant surprise I haven’t had any soreness, fever, or other side effects. I don’t get why so many have been calling for people to not get their vaccine. Get your vaccine, people!!!
2531	105492	@nmanigeria You guys should not sleep over your all important role o. The talk that Nigeria is planning to get covid19 vaccine from China is worrisome, as China did not vaccinate her population in any way to bring the virus under complete control. Stand up for us.
2532	107232	Do we want to face the real possibility of Humanity's extinction?  @potus @secdef @thejointstaff @deptofdefense @who @DrTedros @antonioguterres @UNGeneva everyone wants to live even skull and bone members want life. Vaccines are not the answer Covid-19 is getting stronger..

2534	106731	@siewakes20 @matt_cooper85 @sportbible This might blow your mind but footballers actually did have health problems before the COVID-19 vaccine, just like everyone else in the world 🤦‍♂️
2535	106151	Leo can get fucked. Open it up, anyone who is eligible for a vaccine has had an opportunity to get one, we shouldnt delay any longer when people have their minds made up one way or another RE #COVID19 restrictions
2536	105540	Don't worry ! We have an Australian Billionaire politician deseminating COVID vaccine bullshit like Trump et. al. ! He's the one building the Titanic II in China! I wonder what will sink it? Not an iceberg! Will it be tax evasion/minimisation?
2537	105458	@JHowardBrainMD What is this person even talking about? The great messaging about vaccines is if I got one COVID-19 wasn’t going to kill me or even make me very ill. The restrictions are still in place because of the yet to be vaccinated. Why is this so hard?
2538	201545	Johnson andJohnson Vaccine had Reports of DEATH!Why would anyone want its #Booster?Americans who received Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine should be able to receive a second shot of the vaccine two months after their first dose under an emergency authorization,
2539	106661	It’s gonna work next time guys. They just need to stay home and mask up until we find a better vaccine.
2540	106085	How are the LTC’s still having massive infections? I am sure they are NOT international travellers. What ever happened about your promised iron ring around LTC’s. Get the vaccines in these homes stat.
2541	106937	@HindtTimmy @SandraKM123 @CNNPolitics Funny how CNN changed their coronavirus pandemic ticker to vaccines distributed instead of coronavirus deaths, like it's still not happening.
2542	107506	#RT @JoeBiden: RT @POTUS: The more people that get vaccinated, the faster we will beat this pandemic. That’s why one of my first goals is to administer 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in our first 100 days. I’m proud to say we’re over halfway to our goal and weeks ahead…
2543	105820	@nadhimzahawi @RoyalFamily I’d love to know when my 88 year old mum with underlying health conditions will get hers. This is in B75. Any ideas, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for COVID-19 Vaccine Deployment?
2544	106601	@SuperFastEddie1 @denisemcuevas @Cook33Dalvin So you admit spreading a virus is bad. If you think a flu only takes a few days to get over, you’ve never had the flu. And when we have treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 the way we do for the flu, it will be an equal comparison. Can’t wait for that day.
2545	106185	How are we doing this to our kids LIKE IT'S OK? THIS IS NOT OK.#MaskUp everyone, get the #CovidVaccine if you can, and for the love of whatever god (or none) that you care about, pls @FDA we have to move on the vaccine for kids like it's an EMERGENCY (the E in EUA).
2546	105423	@USATODAY Covid19 vaccines are vaccine in trial,In Just 1st phase has shown that vaccines are not working as intended as vaccines Scientists have to go back to lab and make another vaccine , DON'T USE HUMAN BEING AS YOUR SPECIMEN IN YOUR TRIALS,WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON US
2547	107458	@realDonaldTrump This is how much the Republicans care about America.  Before Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine was proved highly successful, the company offered the Trump admin the chance to lock in supplies but the Trump never made the deal allowing other countries to take its place in line.
2548	107276	@Jc_1978 Well if you’re confident to take the vaccine from psychopathic person that’s ok. The video I put up helps to know him better whether you trust him or notI meant you say there’s no long term vaccine effects but believe in long term cons from virus which is..coronavirus after all
2549	106409	@AnnRudbeck @cliftonaduncan It’s like the flu. The virus will continue to move around the globe &amp; the flu vaccine we receive in North America each year is based on the strain circulating during the winter months in Australia (our summer months). #covid19
2550	106641	"It baffles me every time I hear my peers say ""I don't know what's in the vaccine so I'm not taking it"" My reply-- We've taken well over 7 vaccines since birth without knowing the composition, Covid-19 vaccine isn't any different. Get vaccinated joor!!"
2551	107445	Why are people upset? They were vaccinated. So does this mean vaccines don’t work? Or if they do and getting covid is ok, then why is there any restrictions at all? Makes no sense whatsoever. #covid19 #COVIDIOTS
2552	106484	He needs to be on a ventilator but is refusing because he is afraid he will never wake up.Reminder that getting the vaccine is lower risk than driving on the highway for 0.47 seconds yes I did the actual math.
2553	107631	@NigeriaInfoPH @sparklingoracle Will the vaccine bring to an end of covid19 or we will continue to wear face mask and maintain social distance even after taking the vaccine? Again, my joy is that they will start with the leaders before it gets down to the ordinary people.
2554	106372	@RUSSREBORN i went to my clinic to take my Covid 19 vaccine but now I’m scared, all the vaccines are gone. Coronavirus star player Russell Westbrick took all the shots. he said “i treat my vaccine like I treat the court, i take all the shots”. Whyyy Westbrick. you built my house last week
2555	107269	The Covid19 pandemic is still spreading. The vaccines may or may not work. The chances of not working are higher. The deaths will keep on piling. My estimate of 10 million deaths is likely to be achieved despite the vaccines.
2556	105456	@Dan79596368 You kill me looooooool this is a false equivalence. We don't need COVID-19 vaccines in order to keep our jobs, get an education, buy food, all we need is competency or whatever
2557	106885	I've had my booster and would urge you all to get yours too .. lets do what we can to keep everyone safe !
2558	107514	Oh god. The WhatsApp aunties are gonna be on our ASSES 🥴!! They’re gonna think hot lemonade is the covid-19 vaccine now.
2559	107112	This is why I said take all you can out of me, not doing any good except pain, I am HIV negative which indicates I would be susceptible to influenza/coronavirus which is a cold or flu hence I took Coronavirus vaccine for colds
2560	107125	This is going to complicate things for people claiming to have a “religious exemption” from getting the vaccine, which is great because COVID doesn’t care whether you believe in it or not. It just hopes you’re dumb enough not to get vaccinated so it can take over your lung cells.
2561	107529	@FilmFreeway If they can do that then certainly we must be able to get a proper vaccine for COVID19. Let's get that done &amp; then we can all get back to the theater again...then I'll buy my ticket to see it! 🎬📽🎞💟
2562	105512	@Kinsey73Kinsey @charliekirk11 Coronavirus R&amp;D has been going on for over a decade.Be honest with yourself. You refuse to get the vaccine because you don't like the people who want you to get the vaccine.You people screamed that Dems wanted to prolong Covid, but look who's actually prolonging it.
2563	106849	Isn’t it amazing that when a coronavirus strikes the Western world all stops are pulled out to develop a vaccine against it, but poor countries have had to suffer the devastating impact of malaria for some eternity.#C4News

2567	201759	@DrLeanaWen Lots of folks are in panic mode because they may have taken an Advil hours before the vaccine, as reports are saying the shot could be ineffective. If that is true why no warnings #vaccine #COVID19 No one asked me that when I got my first shot
2568	107545	"THIS. I feel the same. I trust Fauci &amp; science to tell me a vaccine is good to go, NOT the guy who wanted to fire Fauci for saying, ""wear a mask.""Since they've already had the virus, the entire Trump family should get it last? There's ""maybe"" no chance the virus would mutate..."

2570	105955	Will someone PLEASE explain to Meghan McCain that the vaccine is distributed by each Governor's discretion before she embarrasses herself any further?
2571	106850	Partially resistant to new vaccine- so this “sounds” like it’s hitting the already vaccinated or they’d have not phrased it that way.  Sounds more like the vaccine IS the new variant. But some of us predicted that didn’t we? Pathogenic priming anyone?
2572	201758	Can you imagine the emotional anxiety caused by this? What if you took the J&amp;J vaccine and then the scientists and government officials said that it wasn’t safe? My distrust was warranted.
2573	107045	@jossreimer This is so messed up. First of all, there are only two sexes: male and female; . “Intersex” is NOT A THIRD SEX. Why apologize to the tantrum? Gender identity is a superfluous issue when dealing with #COVID19 vaccines on human biology.

2589	107341	I hope 2021 will be better. But I don't think it will be. The 1918 pandemic flu still continues to circulate amongst us today and it took years before the waves subsided. I think the same will happen with this coronavirus. But hopefully the vaccine will make things bearable. 5/n

You get a “casedemic” when testing everyone as PCR is not an indication of illness.the giver in 2009 decided to stop mass testing of swine flu to stop that casepidemic.
2599	106698	Where are the legal/human rights people etc? Blackmail, coercion, abuse etc supposed to be illegal is it not. What happening over forcing COVID19 vaccines is going to change the world in a very nasty way. I just hope it the bullies that get the hard times &amp; not the victims.
2600	201768	@NototyrannyNOW I got the vaccine, I’m a conservative. I’m glad I got it because I’m exposed  daily to Covid19, but have never gotten sick. Why are you hesitant?
2601	106567	@dazbrady @CenGinLondon @toryboypierce @Keir_Starmer @BorisJohnson @coronavirus so what is government’s responsibility then? when do you hold them to account ffs? why is UK having worst death toll and worst recession at the same time? what did the government do right in this pandemic so far? and don’t say vaccines, thats down to individuals coming forward,
2602	105701	So, to sum up the GOP's current talking points, the coronavirus is a hoax, but if you get sick by it, it's the Democrats' fault. Also, you're paying for your own vaccine.
2603	105975	Let it continue to devastate the families.  I don’t care any more. They had their chance to get the vaccine. The deserve what is coming to them.
2604	106024	@NHarris956 @RexChapman It’s very simple You don’t want to receive the #COVID19 #vaccine you don’t get to have the same privileges the rest of us do. We have rights too—not to be sickened by you!
2605	105407	@Tickittybooboo @linda__lou @Mandy1258 @peacelilly44 it's worrying this new variant of Covid-19 let's hope the new vaccine will still protect us from it the scientists are quite optimistic about it, I hear they're working on a nasal spray vaccine that will be good for the children fingers crossed it's rolled out 😊👍🤞🙏💙x
2606	107173	@mlchealth @LAMcbelfast When do partners of the clinically extremely vulnerable get the vaccine? they where priortised for the flu vaccine so why not the Covid19 Vaccine.
2607	106546	@NewYorker This is the scariest article I’ve read in a very long time! Since flu vaccines for each year are made from data taken the year before (because the flu virus mutates), what hope is there for an effective Covid19 vaccine to be available before mid 2021?😰
2608	105290	This fucker is one of the reasons why poor countries cannot fabricate their own vaccines so we can vaccinate the world. He needs to be taxed to hell, and then some.

2612	106570	@StephanieKusie @erinotoole @ShannonStubbsMP @JohnBarlowMP @tomkmiec @KerryLynneFindl Italian researchers: vaccines will not work against SARSCoV2 because this virus does not only replicate in human cells like other viruses, this one replicates through bacteria too.

2615	106124	What if they pack this with a Trojan Virus for which they will be the 1st to discover the next vaccine?
2616	106089	1. How do I get the vaccine? Do I tell my doctor I'm a teacher?2. When do I get the vaccine? Before I go back into the classroom?3. What about other education professionals? For example, EAs and ECEs also work very closely with students.#OntEd #OnPoli

2618	107271	New vaccine they are saying it will take months to roll-out I say it will take years, there are approximately 64.8 million people in the UK work it out...
2619	106855	No one could die for a month and we would still have a second wave just like the first one it didn't happen. They lied about everything. This is about the vaccine that's all wake up people. And I still don't know anyone who has had covid19.
2620	106454	I already have no plans on getting this vaccine because I have common sense. But do they really think THIS is going to get more people to get it? Let’s be real, the people who look up to these shitbags are the ones who already got the vaccine.
2621	106986	transmitted by a bat, it is probably from this that they started, then they modified it. Maybe they wanted to make an AIDS vaccine using a coronavirus as an antigen carrier. A work of sorcerer’s apprentices can be said. Because we must not forget that we are in the world of
2622	107237	@WashTimes In the end 20 years down the road you will see commercials on TV about anyone who has taken the coronavirus vaccine or who has died from it or has gotten sick call the law offices for compensation. Something to think about when you get that 1st injection.

2625	106525	You're going to be put on a list if you refuse to take the vaccine that does nothing but make you sterile.
2626	105313	@Independent I’m not an antivax, I hope we’ll get soon an effective, safe vaccine for #COVID19 but this Labour call for censorship really explains what Labour has become under Sir, an authoritarian, undemocratic, dangerous party

You'll have no one to blame but yourself. And if you do want it. GET IT!But stop forcing everyone to comply
2631	106144	@NBCNews @GavinNewsom Why receive a vaccine for a virus with a 99%+ survival rate, if it is still not clear wether you can still get infected afterwards?
2632	107642	I just cannot get over what a shithead our governor is. He doesn't present a coherent plan of any kind for vaccine roll-out and then when hospitals understandably are chaotic in getting the vaccine out there, he punishes them. This guy MUST be a one-term governor. Outrageous.
2633	106028	@CliveMyrieBBC @PhilipIngMBE @NHSBartsHealth Stop the preaching. Time will tell if you parents are safe raking this synthetic pathogen as it’s legally not a vaccine.

2637	106694	@datboyolly Half ml CoronaVac coming out of China based on pathogens. AZD1222 immune response out of Oxford. So they have already given details but given the fact that there has never been a vaccine for any strain of coronavirus, that's my point, that we should still be very worried.

2644	105956	@YRavenOFFICIAL @hennecd @iHeartApple2 @LegendaryEnergy You bring up a good point. Ivermectin is dirt cheap. If ANY chance it effectively treat COVID-19 it should be studied extensively. The US govt didn't bother studying it because if it worked out would prevent emergency authorization for the vaccine and it won't enrich big pharma.
2645	107270	@realDonaldTrump Anyone has a vaccine for this pandemic, maybe China has the answer their country is clean and they do not have more people with the infection and send doctors to Italy to help with the pandemic, at first hand the Chinese Government developed this pandemic
2646	106411	@Meditationsndz @americamag If they only wanted to engage #POTUS45 on issues he was sympathetic towards, why didn't they urge him to issue an Executive Order to the FDA to develop an ethical #coronavirus #vaccine free of aborted fetal cells?
2647	105911	Mf’s keep saying they don’t trust what’s in the Covid-19 vaccine as if they forgot they went to rehab twice for heroine. Like mf, you’re worried about the wrong needle.

2650	106493	our countries down here aren’t like america, we’ve only started getting the vaccine last month &amp; only elderly/priority people are getting it. less than 3% of the population is vaccinated &amp; even so, they were already gonna donate to pacific countries... do your research?
2651	107422	@Annahar There is hope. In china and Australia and other different country they are using malaria and HIV medicine for coronavirus.And it is working.Plus a vaccine will be approved and done after couple of months. Take the right precaution U WILL SURVIVE
2652	105589	The #COVID19 vaccine news is great. Now, how do officials plan to sell it to Americans who are already saying they won’t take it?

2657	107384	@JuliaHB1 But Julia, there is no permanent vaccine for the flu which is coronavirus. Virus mutate which is why people need vaccinating every year or have a healthy lifestyle which keeps their immune system well. The later is more effective than any vaccine.

(China Style) Covid19 is just the tool they use to get people to accept it
2660	107040	Misleading.If a vaccine was going to be available by that date we'd know.Trump may try and get part's of trial's skipped and fast track one.This is to set up a system as to how a vaccine will be distributed.Who first and so on.I don't have any trust in CDC.This is bull.
2661	107491	@gator_gum I think the provincial governments are hoping they can vaccine their way out of Covid-19 without having to admit it is airborne. The government wouldn’t like the investments that are needed if they admit it is airborne.
2662	107429	To all those pushing for the elderly to get the vaccine before the healthcare workers who are actually working with COVID-19 patients, even if the elderly get vaccines now it won't be safe for you to expose them on Christmas -- it takes three weeks plus another injection first.
2663	106179	Also thanks for the friendly reminder my friend... The vaccine will not replace what we do everyday. We still have to do it until everyone gets vaccinated.
2664	106395	The Oxford vaccine is safe and immunogenic. Now we need to know how effective it will be in reducing the risk of contracting COVID
2665	105208	@DaveColan That’s not even a comparable statement whatsoever. Drunk driving is illegal. Getting a vaccine is a choice. If you think not getting a COVID-19 vaccine is the same as drunk driving you really need to re-evaluate your thought process as a whole.
2666	107578	@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump The vaccine will only work when people can get it. Eight months after this began &amp; the average American still can’t buy a disposable n95 mask. You expect me to believe Trump could manage distribution of a #coronavirus vaccine that requires 2 doses?Gaslighters gonna #gaslight.

2671	106593	@guide_late @ethrop @The_RyN_2k @mamahibou @cyung5 It is not stoping the pandemic.. it’s a corona virus.. read up on them.. lots of coronavirus studies.. they mutate, it’s what they do, regardless of the vaccine and the vaccine does not prevent infection or spread of the virus.. so no social benefit to the vaccine
2672	107634	@MurkeNyou @mesosuchus @Ned_the_zombie @TitusNation Nope. The technology is not new, I never claimed that. But the actual pharmaceutical is new. It was developed last year. They did not have the genomics sequence for COVID-19 until the epidemic started. They could not make the vaccine until having that You lose.

Ask the FDA about it.

2716	106207	@WillBlackWriter You do understand this is a mRNA vaccine?  If you have already had Covid-19 and survived your body has produced the exact same Covid protein as the vaccine is intended to stimulate to produce.  These idiots should really do their research.
2717	106450	If a #COVID19 vaccine is approved in 2020, 65% of U.S. voters surveyed believe it would be rushed without enough testing and 58% said they would wait to get the shot, while 21% said they would never get it, according to a Sept. 6 CBS News poll.#vaccines #FDA #pharma #biotech
2718	107315	If the vaccine works as advertised, then we should not fear the unvaccinated.   If the vaccine does not work, then why are we mandating it? #COVID19
2719	106706	@anxious_Winter2 I had the Moderna vaccine. The needle they use is very thin—it caused no pain. For a day or so after the shot, I had arm soreness and a slight fever. I also felt great relief knowing I and my loved ones were much less likely to get seriously ill from the 2019 coronavirus.
2720	106775	@Ali34351471 @JamesMelville My immune system has looked after me very well so far. I don't need a vaccine for a coronavirus with an exceptionally low mortality rate. They can shove it.
2721	106867	@GOP The truth is #Trump has absolutely nothing to do with the vaccine! It is our vaccine from Germany! Yes, if you @GOP gang hadn't spread lies about the Covid19, 800,000 Americans wouldn't have died! Period!
2722	105602	Why are #Medical #personnel being injected with either empty syringes or ones with a retractable needle? Why do they fear the #vaccine? #COVID19 is not a dangerous disease so they know that no #Vaccination will do any good #cdnpoli They are #antivaxxers #bcpoli #onpoli
2723	106090	The first person to take the COVID19 trial vaccine in the United Kingdom has died!!!#COVID19 #3rdmainlandbridge #COVIDー19 #Qanon#4thmay #lockdown #ufo2020 #Health #GatesOfHellA trial is already claiming a life, imagine what the actual poison will do...
2724	106742	@ryanstruyk @CNN @JohnsHopkins If China created COVID-19 why wouldn’t they create a vaccine before releasing it? Could China already have a vaccine to protect their communist elite???
2725	105266	"I keep seeing ppl say ""wheres the cure for the Coronavirus don't let the scientist fool u. We have a serious problem and It might take months to slow the spread. It took us like 5 years for a vaccine for SARS which is a different form of coronavirus so good luck with that cure"
2726	106299	I believe in opening up America but I also believe in mandating strict adherence to the CDC safety guidelines for COVID-19 and that all people should probably get the vaccine not be mandated to get it but do it on their own
2727	106933	Since 1921. So why does everyone think a vaccine for COVID-19 is going to be some kind of cure all for the virus. The virus will most likely never go away. If you want to listen to an expert on how to avoid getting the virus, listen to someone speaking on building...
2728	201583	seems like I'm one of the lucky 275,000 Australians that have been fully vaccinated against #COVID19 out of a population of 20,000,000 plus according to my Covid Certificate I received today after my last jab (via myGov) WTF @ScottMorrisonMP this is not good enough #AstraZeneca
2729	106656	@JohnMappin China figured out how to make a perpetual coronavirus that is attacking the world, which they have the vaccine for, but will never share until submission.This type of Warfare is Democrat/Deep State approved.Time to start busting some heads. Count me in @realDonaldTrump
2730	105385	@TeamPelosi There is a vaccine against the Coronavirus, China has it, it does not say it because it would accept that it is guilty of spreading the Chinese virus
2731	106016	A reporter just asked Gladys: “Why are unvaccinated aged care workers still in the system?” The #media are helping the government push mandatory vaccination to the point where if you don’t get it you’ll lose your job.Shame on them. #auspol #COVID19 #vaccine
2732	106096	We NEED everyone that can be vaccinated to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Protect your family. As soon as you are able to get the vaccine, don’t hesitate.
2733	106380	@JimmyLloyd20 Hey Jimmy. I took the coronavirus vaccine yesterday. I'm diabetic and my mother advised me to. Anyway I have a questionIs it normal to feel soreness near the injection site?
2734	105538	Hey Boris, I will go get my vaccine (Not a phucking chance) if you tell the Nation how many people died FROM covid? Remember not WITH, tell them how many actually died from covid.. I will wait as I know everyone will want to hang you when they know. Psss it only a few hundred...
2735	105261	@joaomtcosta @helopait @DrTomFrieden Why haven’t they ever developed a Coronavirus vaccine do you think?  Why????????  Think????  It mutates too fast/often.  Anti-vaxxers aren’t the problem.
2736	107221	All these coronavirus stock will go to 2 dollar No vaccine will be effective Eventually all will develop antibody on their own if they don’t already have
2737	201565	To celebrate getting my first #Pfizer vaccine! I’m going to stream some @PlayApex  tonight 🙂🙌🏻 @YouTubeGaming @YouTube!! Just going my part to be safe from #COVID19 @PlayStation
2738	107157	I am not #streaming tonight - I am a bit under the weather after receiving my second COVID-19 vaccine. Nothing serious at all, just kinda feel crummy (which is to be expected) - I am gonna try and get some rest. I will shoot for streaming tomorrow night &lt;3 Love you all!#music
2739	106281	The @AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is beginning to sound like an @Apple IOS update. One has to wait for others to try it before one realises it there are bugs to sort out. 😳🤔#AstraZeneca #Luxembourg#UOT#CovidVaccine#COVID19UG
2740	106970	There is evidence that Hydroxychloroquine and Dexamethasone are effective...there is no money in that though! To date there is NO vaccine for any coronavirus, so what confidence can we have that there can be an effective one for Covid19 -  in a very short timescale?🤔
2741	107588	No 😐.(Why is anyone getting the vaccine before #HealthcareHeroes? Why did #OJSimpson get it? Has everyone that works with the public gotten it, yet? How are #smokers a priority? Why has only 2% of the population gotten it? Why can't they figure this stuff out?)
2742	106557	Why would I give my children and experimental vaccine for a curable infection?  If you would have listened to our President we would have seen this gone in weeks after initial exposure.   The dems are going to try to get segregation one way or another.
2743	106355	What the hell kind of statement is that from Franklin? Who says they'll get any vaccine they'd give me? That's just plain lunacy.
2744	105325	@gabrielyanrob USA is NOT a dictatorship and NO WAY will they make covid19 vaccine mandatory! That’s unconstitutional &amp; mentally and PHYSICALLY abusive to enforce it on everybody! 😤😠Let those people get it who want to, and healthcare workers need to get it since they work with sick patients!
2745	106547	"Dead serious, I just saw this Q submitted for Sanjay Gupta on CNN:""So if I don't get infected with coronavirus, do I still have to get the vaccine?"" WTF are we doing in science class these days?"

2750	105825	@wave3news So here's another push by this in power to get vaccinated, but why? If it's a new variant, how can there already be a vaccine for it? The old vaccines are not going to be effective, yet they're pushing us to get jabbed now! Why? #vaccination #lies #COVID19 #control
2751	106625	I think there will be a vaccine. The question is whether it will be safe and effective or just another con like Trump University. I am betting on a con that will result in even more deaths.
2752	106533	Because vaccines aren't a magic talisman? They don't make you immune to Covid, they just give your immune system a better chance of fighting off an infection should it occur. This is literal 6th grade science stuff.
2753	106787	The coronavirus is a VIRUS, not unlike the common cold (rhinovirus) (I AM NOT A DOCTOR SO I COULD BE WRONG, DON’T @ ME).There’s no vaccine for the cold. Y’all really need to shut the fuck up about a magical vaccine, because I’m really fucking tired of hearing about it.
2754	105882	Grown people in America can't comprehend the damage that their opposition to vaccines has caused.They don't get it that this virus is mutating weekly.Conditions change for US all weekly.Stop complaining about something antivaxxers have caused.Do what you should. Mask and vax.
2755	106302	The vaccine isn’t an immunisation. Every winter the NHS is in crisis. Fix the NHS. Oh and the vaccine doesn’t stop you catching or spreading the virus it’s just meant to stop you being poorly enough to go in hospital
2756	201673	@darakass I'm pro-vaccine and am fantasizing about a COVID19 vaccine daily but I won't trust a Nov 1st vaccine.
2757	105735	@AlexDevantier I will commit suicide before I take a coronavirus vaccine I've had all other vaccines. No way in Hell am I having this
2758	201573	Feeling thankful! My parents got their first dose of the #Moderna #COVID19 #vaccine back home in Illinois today 💙
2759	105409	Everyone in Estonia and the other countries must get Covid-19 vaccine!!! That’s very important for all of us to get rid of this terrible pandemic!!! Please keep your distance and wear a mask!!! Please tell the others too to get their Covid-19 vaccine!!!
2760	105341	@jw_wilkerson @_StephanieMyers @OANN Are you telling me i have a greater risk of dying from this vaccine than the actual coronavirus. Hahaha. No thanks. This is hilarious why would i take the vaccine. Im going to say its against my religion
2761	106465	I say this to the person who seemed proud of having gone 46 years without a flu shot, are you going to refuse the COVID-19 vaccine when it comes out?I said I get the flu shot for myself and because my MD demands it and these are true BUT I also get it so that I don't
2762	106257	"""X number of people still haven't gotten the vaccine"" But do they want the skunk vaccine? They want the vaccine made for animals?? I thought we were done taking medicine made for our furry friends"
2763	106388	Though the threat of Covid-19 is real enough, why is SA and other countries being pushed into taking the vaccine, when China the origin of it all recovered using herd immunity?
2764	106398	@LebienHeure @guardian If you didn't need to get a flu jab every three months, why would you need to get Covid-19 boosters this frequently? It makes zero sense.
2765	105857	@DHSCgovuk @MattHancock We not be able to get a vaccine for the coronavirus been trying for years yet in 7 months you've managed to get one for covid19. No liability clause too. Yeah right! There has been no long term studies so how do we know what the effects are after 1 to 2 years.
2766	107670	Hmmm so children should take a vaccine they don’t need for a virus the vulnerable are protected from just because adults say so....? Not the best lesson to teach kids.
2767	107205	@KniskernMary @vgcrutchfield @RonFilipkowski I think my wife has an extra coupon you can use.  It gets you a free microchip enhanced COVID-19 vaccine with any two late term abortions.
2768	201559	I can finally make a tweet to say that my parents officially got their first doses of COVID-19 vaccine today! An awesome sigh of relief. Stay safe everybody! Thank you @HPEPublicHealth #COVID19 #Vaccine #BayOfQuinte
2769	107476	@mickiedances @Sowzees @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC 1 a flu virus with a vaccine and acquired immunity. The other is a novel Coronavirus without any acquired immunity and no vaccine. Your hype is pathetic.
2770	107080	I have to option to get the Covid-19 vaccine today since I work in a long-term care facility, or I can wait a couple months for the second round....
2771	201660	Ugh. Someone give me the vaccine. I am back in the classroom this semester and I reallllly don’t want to get sick. I’ve never been to the hospital  and I don’t want to go for the first time at 37. #COVID19

2773	107359	@BlueBisonBBQ @Hell_Ashes @theoctobear @Derek_Hennett @AlexNotAnder_ They were going to use this type of vaccine for SARS but the disease almost disappeared after a year. So they had done there trials like for Covid-19 which took about a year but by the time they were going to roll out the vaccine to the public the disease was as widely spread.
2774	107267	#COVID19 #Vaccine...and,... vaccine only lasts for a few months, it's not lifetime.(And if you got China's vaccine, it's good for a few minutes. Enough to get you back from the clinic to your car. 😂)😷✌️

2776	106106	@skinnywhiteki11 @DoubleBullseye1 @SharpFootball That’s weird ...How long has Chinese Virus been around? Just because it is a “novel” Coronavirus will we have to come up with a different vaccine for every strain? why don’t we have a vaccine for H1N1/SARS?

2779	105993	@SusanRLane @BrakTalk @William84214395 @ZeroFrucks @clairlemon There is not one covid-19 vaccine. They are all different.
2780	105845	Bill Gates warns against coronavirus vaccine going to highest bidder — Oh, very well. Let it go to his kids (Billy's kids) free of charge. We don't want it, anyway. Besides, they're probably speaking of that wiccan broth Melinda pulled out of Cernunos ass.
2781	106310	Because they haven’t got their vaccine yet. Why? Because it’s not their turn yet. Until when? Until when? Harini je dah ada a few under thirties without any comorbidity issues died. And yet there are elderlies yang tak dapat vaccination date lagi.
2782	105858	Vaccines prevent infections in the first place. Governor Chaos wants you to get sick so he can make money on the treatments.
0	111083	@tamifairchild1 @KingMoyer @TheRightMelissa @RealCandaceO Indeed certain vaccines can in a small number of cause such responses. However, in those cases so would the virus being immaculated against. Actually, that is the problem with the more severe presentation of coronavirus (and I am concerned that a vaccine may be bad for some)
1	110702	@deep_biden the govt system has created corona.they want a depopulation. they only care about wealth, not humanity.Thats why we see idiotic restrictions, toxic vaccines and a couple variants of corona now,..What would be necessary is to get rid of the coronavirus wit chemikalsthesolution
2	110204	The Canadian HC @mckinnondavid blocked me for pointing this out, but Canada is screwing countries like ours with vaccine nationalism. Sri Lankans need to stop serving him breakfast
3	109871	I’m a consultant in ICU and we have lots of #COVID19 patients. We have great PPE and my risk is low. But it’s not zero. And I might catch it in the community anyway. The vaccine protects me. But it also protects my family. And that protects other families.
4	108890	Comparing the covid-19 vaccine with the smallpox vaccine if like comparing apples to fish.  You get away with this because people have no clue scientifically how they are made tested and then administered. Other then they are paying people and begging you to get the covid-19 jab.
5	201923	I (finally) have my appointment for the booster shot. I work from home and always wear a mask so I've been putting it off.Everyone should get their 3rd dose of the vaccine. The shots you got a few months ago are not good enough anymore. #Omicron #Covid19
6	111885	The first phase 1 trial for a Coronavirus vaccine occured today.  It only took 65 days from obtaining sequence to the first trial injection.  Fastest in U.S. history. Hopefully the trials will prove vaccine effective.
7	109003	Omicron came out like a week ago, they say they have a vaccine for it already, and then wonder why people are skeptical
8	110186	@Goalkickingguru They've been working on mRNA vaccines to tackle coronaviruses since the 2002 outbreak of SARs. Believe it or not, the first coronavirus was detected in animals in the 1920s.It's cute you think it was all new last year. Bless.
9	110122	No surprise there.Next will be Rump's snake oil vaccine to stop Covid infections @MaddowBlog  Beware!
10	110535	Reading comments on Facebook and getting excited that the plot twist in the COVID-19 drama is that once a vaccine is created it's useless because half the population refuse to take it
11	109635	@LolaNJ20 @davidmweissman @marcorubio These people get the vaccine first like they got the best medical treatment, no average American can afford, when they got infected just to tell everyone that Covid19 is just a mild flu.🙄
12	108476	@hellyboo778 Hi there, COVID-19 vaccinations are not currently mandatory in the UK, but are a legal requirement to work in some social care settings. It is the colleague’s decision whether they receive the vaccine or not. [1/2]
13	201919	As of Wednesday, 611,429 individuals had received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and 166,131 have been fully vaccinated.
14	112294	I didn't hear discussion in the Senate COVID-19 hearing today that indicated that our scientists are interacting w/scientists around the world on vaccine development. Why not? Shouldn't it be an international effort to deliver the best vaccine to everyone?(Sen Burr mentioned it.)
15	109103	It has to be here everyone is flying all over the world bring it here or brining it there. But the good news is the vaccine might still work? I say might. No science at this point. All they have to do is reformulate 7.4 billion doses or is it 14.8 doses? I am moving to a desert.
16	109066	@DavidChalmers1 @CareyGercarey @LBC @NickFerrariLBC Interesting conundrum. How will you feel if he is offered it and takes your advice and refuses it. He then contracts COVID-19 and dies before Oxford vaccine is available. The Pfisor vaccine works for others but you advised against it. Not sure I could live with that. 🤔
17	110709	Extending is not the same as using it. It is there in case it is needed which is right in my view when we have no real date when all adults will be vaccinated in this country, (that is first and second jab) and too little knowledge yet regarding new variants. We are nearly there.
18	201929	I just got my Covid-19 vaccine, I’m so happy I could cry happy tears . #vaccinated Thank you to all the doctors, scientists and CDC for making this happen
19	110194	"Sources tell me Bill Gates just made an airborne coronavirus ""vaccine"" and the only way to stop it from getting in you is if you wear a mask. 😷"
20	108710	@Linda36758099 I think they've been working on much better flu treatments, stuff that will boost your immune system in general to help you fight off whatever causes flu. I think that's what the non deepfrozen ones are, like AZ/Oxford one There ain't no covid19 so there can't be a vaccine1
21	110208	Why does an asshole like @marcorubio get to skip the line? Why waste it on someone who knowingly spreads the virus? The vaccine should go to hospital workers first.
22	108300	I’m not sure what to believe here. Surely he wouldn’t sacrifice his own child for political gain, but it’s Putin, so maybe he would? If there is a vaccine. Which there is probably not.  Sigh.
23	112588	If your employer requires a #Covid19 vaccine and you refuse to take it, you're getting fired for not supporting the values of the organization you work forNo one should support any product or company if they can't support their values
24	107733	@PutinsLapDog @RepThomasMassie So what happened when a fully  vaxxed person get the coronavirus again? The non-vaxxed get a refund?
25	108120	@JoeBiden If the vaccines work so great, why are vaccinated so afraid of getting Covid-19, you have to keep wearing masks? Plus being so scared of the unvaccinated, you fired them from their jobs. Forcing kids to get vaccinated when the risk is higher for them then Covid-19 is plain evil.
26	110920	.@JohnCornyn lies again.@JoeBiden called for every state, territory, tribe to open up vaccinations for all by May 1; not every person be vaccinated by May 1.Even if vaccines are open to all by May 1st, it'll still be a heavy lift.It takes 2 wks after each shot for immunity.
27	107703	From what I've seen around the world, the only assumption anyone can make (and I've had this assumption a long while) is that the #COVID19 virus is in the #vaccine.#Covid19UK #WearAMask ?🤦‍♂️
28	110631	The #BoosterShot kicked my butt. Down with Fever. Aches. Arm hurts. But I am grateful to have the shot. I don’t want #COVID19 anymore. I’ve had it 2x. And amazingly I am still walking the earth. The #VaccineSideEffects are worth the blessing of life! Get #vaccinated
29	111098	Poor lady. I hope she doesn't have any side effects. The way everyone is pushing this vaccine is unreal.
30	112113	Do you plan on getting on an airplane BEFORE there is a #COVID19 vaccine?#coronavirus #FundraisingTwitter
31	108444	@rebekahiknight @trekker34 @realDonaldTrump I don't understand... are there more or less deaths because of Covid19? If it's a hoax... why Trump worked so hard to provide us a vaccine?.Why the GOP are getting it? please don't follow their example and wait, essential workers deserve to get the vaccine first.
32	110353	This is what's going to HAPPEN if these STUPID people out there take this UN-NECESSARY VACCINE for a non-existent VIRUS that is nothing more then the COMMON COLD as Covid-19 nothing more then the flu and Pneumonia  masquerading as Covid-19 @JustinTrudeau
33	201905	I felt like I was holding my breath waiting for my grandmother to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Te amo muchísimo grandma💛 @UnivHealthSA https://t.co/oV54KXBm1o
34	111814	My grandparents have yet to find the vaccine. The war crime hearings can wait, they deserve to rot in their cell anyway. Why is it so hard for our government to take care of the American people? They literally work for us.
35	109324	I’ve always been pro-vaccines.  But after having a bad reaction to a pneumonia vaccine that took me to the ER this past May... I’m not going volunteer to be 1st in line for the COVID-19 vaccine. But I’ll get it eventually. Probably.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
36	110861	@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump President Obama got the H1N1 therapeutics out in less than 2 months &amp; the vaccine out in 6 months. It is now past 10 months for the Covid-19 vaccine. So how is this a great achievement?? How has Trump done anything????
37	108320	Oh... oh no. It's going to be one thing to get everyone to even take the vaccine, but asking them to keep wearing masks?This pandemic is never going to end.
38	108630	@Europe_Awake_ @SethMacFarlane So this says they contracted delta variant from abroad…which might be America’s fault considering we’re providing untaxed hosts for it to mutate in😬but it is sad they’re all getting sick again☹️I just don’t see where it blames the vaccine or COVID-19 (non variant)
39	201809	Happy to get my first COVID-19 jab today, but I'm angry that my mum is still yet to have her first. Corby Lakeside surgery had promised to get in contact weeks ago to arrange a special appointment because of worries about a possible allergic reaction, but still nothing.
40	109836	@able_pearl @Sea_2Lake @tina_reunite @Abn_RN No, the point is that you're much less likely to get COVID-19 if you take proper measures, including getting the vaccine, and if you do get it, you're less likely to need hospitalization and less likely to spread it because you're staying home and get over it faster.
41	111893	Admission: I was raised but a somewhat anti-vaccination father, and as a result, have always been very anxious about getting the flu vaccine.  To the point that I've never gotten it.  In fact, the covid-19 vaccine is the first vaccine I've ever received as an adult.
42	110991	@NationBreaking TSC has DIRECTED teachers to get COVID-19 vaccine within 7 days or be disciplined; they are not entitled to any RIGHT to their personal health? Will LEARNERS not vaccinated be EXPELLED from school? PARENTS not vaccinated barred entry from schools?! TSC must stop  being PUNITIVE.
43	111765	@AlexBerenson Can you please check into this Alex? I wonder if all the vaccines out are using fetal cells?
44	107796	@JWall714 @LAkersDLions @BleacherReport @evanmanivong @IlliniMGym You know how epidemiologist know that mRNA vaccines are low risk and effective? Because we’ve used them on other coronavirus strains like H1N1. So please shut the fuck up and stop fear mongering if you can’t comprehend basic medical science.
45	110773	@Cleavon_MD @SusanSchutte2 So sorry to hear about this. My question for our @Cleavon_MD why are there people still dying from Covid-19 if we already have the vaccine?
46	107808	"Vaccine passports? They need to be free, private, and secure, but I don't think anyone has stepped up to the plate yet in the U.S. Who's gonna jump in to declare - ""There's an app for that!"" Until then we laminate. https://t.co/5OPToGYIlN"
47	110132	Strange how it is approved as long as no other treatments are available. Since there are other treatments, does that mean it isn’t safe or approved? Looks like it. Last vaccine approved has 49 years of testing…
48	107922	@paulabagwell3 @corybernardi @OslundArthur We'll see when you are exposed to the wild virus. I'd say you're the ignorant one. In previous animal trials for coronavirus vaccines all the animals died when they came in contact with the wild virus due to ADE. How confident are you feeling??
49	112185	Punjab has way bigger population then Sindh, but the #coronavirus cases in both the provinces are almost the same. Lafafa journalists, @NajamSethiShow ,  were saying that #SindhGovt has performed the best in this crisis, and had imposed a stricter lockdown. Where are the results?
50	109934	I stg on everything that is me I will absolutely 100% NOT get a coronavirus vaccine lmfaooo what a JOKE
51	108372	@GovBillLee And you are discouraging Covid-19 vaccination?   It’s personal, but the Flu vaccine is public?  How did you get so far under the thumb of the morons who worship the last president?  Why do you hate Tenneseans so much?
52	111746	“On the question of when a coronavirus vaccine may be developed and distributed, Trump said Americans ‘could have a very big surprise coming up.’
53	111969	@jasonmarcelTO @AliceMcGovern4 The follow up for the clinical trials have not even been completed...what do you not understand?This is still relatively new...we have also never mass vaccinated a human population for a coronavirus. You can't coerce people to take this vaccine...there are legitimate concerns.
54	111563	so quickly! The new coronavirus was only discovered a year ago and the technology that some of these companies are using to create a vaccine is cutting edge. During this Thanksgiving week I am grateful for this modern miracle. #GiveThanks
55	108236	You know it’s bad when they don’t even bother telling you how many are vaxxed and unvaxxed. They lost the plot
56	202262	There are 3 things on my Christmas list - rapid COVID testing, a safe vaccine &amp; a cwtch (hug) from my family. Hopefully one step closer today. However, like all Christmas wishes, the gifts have to get there safely, work after being unwrapped and come with batteries. 🤞#COVID19
57	112327	There is no “after corona”. Coronavirus is here and it’s going to stay, vaccine or not. We won’t wake up in 2021 and suddenly the virus has died. But we cannot live like this forever, enough is enough. We need our new normal to look more like our old normal
58	109782	Ever wonder why there's never been a Coronavirus v*xx before? How about why there is no vaccine for dengue?
59	109455	@Mark_Whitelegge It’s like people who voted for Trump: they think he’s a demigod who can do no wrong 😑 coronavirus isn’t the only threat to the future of humanity, stupidity is just as bad and we don’t have a vaccine for the latter.
60	107909	It was never going to be different with this COVID19 vaccine. Why would it be?! I don’t understand the think pieces and perseverations... It was always going to be this way. The west first, and when they eventually feel like it: everybody else. And that’s that on that 🙄😒
61	112282	@GregHuntMP Will you assure us within the relevant margins of safety that the Coronavirus vaccine will be safe and effective when the vaccine is ready and that it will not be released before that standard is reached? DW
62	111754	Has anyone had the AstraZenica vaccine? Just wondering how it went. Any problems afterwards?#COVID19 #vaccine #sideeffects
63	111428	People saying they won’t get the COVID19 vaccine when it comes out don’t even understand that it won’t even be AVAILABLE to them when it comes out. The vaccines will come out in waves &amp; certain people in certain professions will get it 1st.
64	108606	Going to be a long time before a safe vaccine is developed. Ref. Dengue vaccine approved and then failing. When vaccine is avail there are 8b ppl to vaccinate. we've had safe polio vaccine for 50+ years but ppl in some places not yet vaccinated. No guarantees of quick relief
65	112718	I am not hearing good things about this vaccine - We are not planning on getting the COVID-19 vaccine and I would not recommend it for children either. #COVID19
66	109954	@HouseGOP my question is why are chinese getting live COVID-19 vaccines?...why is USA pushing so hard for vaccination?...are these vaccines a match up for a future bug guaranteeing 100% lethality?...
67	108786	@empireofthekop So all the “voiders” say it’s to dangerous to restart this season but feck lets get it going in August - Coronavirus will be here till a vaccine is found next year and if we start 20/21 what if there’s a second spike and say a “voider” is top there wouldn’t be a fuss?
68	112372	Warning: It's too early to get vaccinated. The clinical trial of vaccines for novel coronavirus has not yet been completed.
69	109874	it the coronavirus vaccine is not free, the only point in developing one is solely for pharmaceutical company greed because a significant percentage of the population won’t be able to afford it, and the feds don’t care. Sick.
70	110740	All the money in the world is not going to keep Covid-19 out of the schools UNLESS it's to purchase a vaccine once developed and proven to work.
71	108920	@varun_mathur So you’re saying you created The Time Machine but couldn’t find the vaccine for coronavirus. Ok
72	110404	@Clint0nAnders0n @CTVNews You should actually do some research on the coronavirus vaxxx's they were producing after the SARS outbreak. It killed all the animals in the trials, and these vaccines they skipped the animal trials and went straight to humans. You can have my shot 😊
73	110717	@washingtonpost How about just realizing that the IFR of CoVid-19 does not justify getting an UNTESTED vaccine that has not been out for long enough to know the long term health effects!CoVid-19? We know its long term health effects in the real world. Taking my chances with it!
74	108902	@A2ZJIRWINKO Hello hypocrisy! You would think anti-vaxxers wouldn't be vaccinated at all given what they are preaching! I am not an anti-vaxxer for the record, since I got flu shots every year and I'm definitely getting the covid-19 vaccine too.
75	108030	Best news ever Barbara has her COVID19 vaccine tomorrow! Is there any better gift that this vaccine on her 90th Birthday! whoo hoo!
76	112089	@MattHancock didn’t know nurses delivered flu vaccines! 🤣This is what we get by not having clinicians/scientists leading our health and social care strategies.
77	112082	@bamableu @elsbet I’m going to continue wearing my mask until this coronavirus disappears until further notice my mask stays on and no vaccine 💉
78	109904	Very nice piece parsing out why there are 2 different efficacy rates given for AstraZeneca’s COVID vaccine and what it means.
79	110971	Getting approved to get my vaccine by the end of this week and I want this vaccine 👇🏾🥺Pretty please 🙏
80	108076	If they come up with a vaccine for the #coronavirus, will the antivax parents let their kids take it?
81	202433	My husband has been working in the frontline since Covid happened and today, he is getting his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. 🙏🏻 Thank you, Lord!!! 😭😭😭
82	110428	@KPSCALnews got my first does of the vaccine in Glendale. The process couldn’t have gone any smoother and the people could not have been any nicer. #COVID19 #vaccine #Moderna #glendale
83	110447	I have gotten the covid vaccine about 20 times now. 4 Pfizer, 12 moderna, 4 Johnson. Once I got my first vaccine, I started having cravings for it. There is something so great knowing I am reducing the spread of the coronavirus with each of them. I am feeling so empowered.
84	108973	...and if you’re going to refuse a vaccine against medical advice (like, from a real MD not a naturopath) please feel free to go live in the mountains or desert somewhere as a hermit and let the rest of us get along without your idiocy #bye #AntivaxIsAntiSmart #GTFOH
85	108572	I’m jus gone go ahead and say this now... don’t try to force athletes to be the first take this vaccine.
86	109588	@EMurrayUNC @Ordinary1World @WhyKnotBC35 Vaccine? But why? Stupid. Get COVID-19 it’s 99.96% survivability. No flu vaccine or COVID for me
87	111837	Interesting that i couldn't see this shared on their twitter page @GOVUK If they actually want our views, it might be a good idea to share this information widely. #Vaccine #COVID19
88	110240	@yashar I’m glad they are working on a vaccine, however there is not currently enough data to suggest a vaccine will be necessary.I don’t get the impression that COVID-19 has what it takes to hang around long enough to justify a vaccine.I’m a no. I will re-evaluate if relevant in 22.
89	112342	these people won’t get the vaccine because it’s “experimental” but are first in line for monoclonal antibodies🖕🖕🖕🖕
90	110265	@pritipatel Coronavirus is a hoax Priti, even David Davis said this was an exercise.The tests don’t work.The government is using psychological warfare against the population to spread fear.End game is to force the population into accepting vaccines and an RFID chip inserted into them.
91	109055	"@KeithDo59037497 @TiceRichard Matt Hancock ""This vaccine will not be used for children. It hasn't been tested on children. And the reason is that the likelihood of children having significant detriment if they catch Covid-19 is very, very low. ""So, this is an adult vaccine, for the adult population."""
92	110609	@thistlethwaite7 @MML88902406 @BBCNews Cancer, mutations of the cell, is far more complex to cure than a Coronavirus.It's also worth noting, other coronavirus vaccines were already being developed, so the COVID vaccines not only had the entire planet's effort put towards them, but much of the work already finished.
93	109506	@JRubinBlogger This population probably overlaps with the antivaxxers who will not take the #COVID19 vaccines. These people might need their own country.
94	110675	You need to educate them on how antibody-dependent enhancement works. Ask them if they knew ADE occurred in all the animal vaccine studies testing coronavirus. They’ll quarantine themselves once they get it!
95	110192	Sabalenka: ''I don't really trust it (vaccine), I don't want my family make it'' Also Sabalenka's fans: ''she's not anti-vax'' ???
96	107731	Another plague is approaching and will infect every facet of your life: pumpkin spice flavoring. Unlike coronavirus, there is no hope of a vaccine
97	110577	@noahlove I live in Victoria and the vaccine police came to my place and gave me the vaccine and then they vaccinated my beta fish, who isn’t even a person. And then they started vaxxing all my houseplants, and gave my fish enough doses that he's protected for COVID-19 through to 649
98	112509	"@mchooyah '....prevents anything but an honorable discharge for servicemembers who refuse to get the COVID-19 vaccine"" Sums it up for me"
99	112200	Isn’t it interesting? A vast majority of Trumplings and/or anti-vaccine individuals who get Covid, after being infected state they should have taken the vaccine. How many who’ve gotten the virus, say they were correct and the virus and vaccine information is still a hoax.
100	108819	Horrific. Why #vaccines being developed in #Cuba and countries like India are needed for their own population and all poor countries. #HealthForAll #COVID19 #pandemic @FinlayInstituto @BioCubaFarma @centro_cim @CIGBCuba @opscuba @OPSOMSMexico
101	112437	Tomorrow is the first of my COVID-19 vaccine shoot. I am excited about it and can’t ask a better gift this year. Since misery likes company I am taking one of my Soldier PFC Ber****” 😀😀😀😀
102	109797	@charlieball801 @JazzFanAcct @andyblarsen @el_diamante3 They’re already finding different strains of the virus. That doesn’t bode well for a vaccine or shot. At some point we may be forced to face the fact that coronavirus is here to stay and we’ll have to learn to live with it. Scary to imagine for sure if it ends up being the case.
103	108179	Is the R correct and the right formula to be using .. either way, it’s manipulated to get a vaccine and v-health passport out there #testbeforeinsertavaccine
104	108255	And what’s in the vaccines they are so desperate for us to take?Aborted baby cells and DNA.Nanotechnology? Do some searching. It will scare the crap out of you
105	110013	I'm not taking any vaccine on this subject..and if the government tried to mandate it..there will be a revolution like NO other..@POTUS
106	109495	We’ll take 67% when so many red state politicians have been attacking the vaccines from the get go. Keep going!
107	201983	@just1leslie I had Covid-19 in the fall, and pretty bad. There was a chance to get the vaccine at a little facility that had a use or lose situation. I called my doctor and was told to get the vaccine the first chance I had.  I got does one and get dose 2 in two weeks.
108	112362	I’m feeling like the coronavirus is going to be similar to the flu in regards to it being airborne, perpetually recurrent, seasonal and likely needing annual booster shots to bolster immunity.We may never get past it, and likely need to just learn to adapt through it.
109	109749	Scientist don’t make a big deal about the flu because there is always a ready made vaccine present. There is literally no answer for the coronavirus at the moment. How do people not get that. 🤦🏾‍♂️
110	112149	Even if You’ve Had COVID-19 You Still Need the Vaccine Even if you’ve had COVID-19, getting the vaccine may help prevent reinfection and lower your risk of getting sick again.(Feed generated with FetchRSS)
111	110472	@Stewy13 @PnPCBC @CQualtro a) I said it's like getting a flu shot. b) No one is forcing anyone to get the covid-19 vaccine to protect their heath &amp; others. It's a health, not a political, choice. All choices have consequences good &amp; bad. c) I don't care if some people in the USA are against vaccines.
112	202271	Also, got my first COVID-19 vaccine dose. One hour has passed, feeling A-okay as of now. https://t.co/23j2cDtQdv
113	110055	@airstripone84 @ThomasSowell90 @YardleyShooting You're alleging that people who have had a coronavirus vaccine will get very ill or die upon subsequent infection with coronavirus. In the absence of evidence to back up that assertion, I think we can safely assume you're making it up.
114	109119	Yo, we're gonna find out how serious anti-vaxxers are if/when we get the vaccine for the Corona Virus. #coronavirus #antivax
115	108436	City on the move.But move.But Mumbaikars need to move around with#Brakes in their legs.Any digression will be an endless struggle to preserve life.Caution with Care should be the mantra till a  a vaccine is discovered.
116	112801	Why don’t we call #Coronavirus vaccine a medication if we have to take it every year? #AstraZeneca #Pfizervaccine
117	110755	You know you are stupid when you deny vaccines to menstruating women as it would cause complications without any data to back it. Karnataka going their own way. #COVID19 #Karnataka #VACCINE
118	202167	Got my second dose of the COVID-19 #PfizerVaccine today and then played some video games with my sons. Get vaccinated so I can have visitors again! #SundayShelves #GamersUnite #ShareYourGames #retrogames #GetVaccinated https://t.co/e2oL826Knk
119	112124	@RepCori @All435Reps @RepBarragan @POTUS Get out there and talk to people . Many POC are refusing to take the #coronavirus vaccine .
120	109632	@DailyMailUK Had the flu jab once sick for 4 days, never again.... they can swivel on my middle finger anyone who comes to me with the Covid19 vaccine will look smiling with no fucking teeth.. simple @GBNEWS
121	111075	@realTuckFrumper If the #COVID19 variants don't kill the anti-vaxxers, their cures will. Either way, it will expedite herd immunity. Only the vaxxed will survive.
122	111776	Looks like I'm eligible in the second group of 'essential workers'.Hopefully this means I can get my vaccine before the summer.
123	109382	@Why are they trying so hard to blame pro vaccine politicians for pressuring for the vaccine/mask and not coronavirus????
124	109071	On my way to get the Covid-19 vaccine. Remember; even after you get the vaccine, you are not immune. Please continue to wear masks and stay home, not only for you but for others. Their safety IS your responsibility.
125	110733	I hate these little scare tactics...vaccine don’t prevent you from never getting covid it’s like the flu shot. You may get the flu after getting vaccinated but you may not get as sick or die from it. It’s the same for the covid vaccine
126	108687	My heart goes out to the innocent victims of the irresponsibly selfish, but:We Told You So, FloriDUH!Everyone should be wearing masks until a vaccine is in wide use.
127	111599	Fauci is the snake in the White House! He needs the been snuffed out! There is an ulterior motive here! It begs the question of what that is!? My guess...financial interests in vaccines and investments in big pharma! I hope he pays the price when he is finally exposed!
128	107819	Today’s #coronavirus briefing is a big #FluVaccine ad/push. What the hell is going on @POTUS? The flu vaccine is dangerous and has low efficacy. Your Task Force is already pandering it as a requirement for the fall along w an agenda to reduce vaccine hesitancy.  #VaccineAgenda
129	109972	@RobertKennedyJr @TLAVagabond no #vaccine for me, i am not a #guineapig, thex couldn't exctinct the flu and still no #vaccine against #HIV and other #disease, so it's stupid to believe that they have a vaccine against #COVID19 in 5 minutes compared to other deseases
130	111044	This is another reason vaccine passports are a joke. It's not the bubonic plague, and everybody who wants a vax soon will get one (I'm getting my first shot today, for example).
131	109740	Twat is back from his holidays.  Lies! There cannot be 100,000 people stupid enough to take a vaccine that we know is untested, rushed &amp; where the vaccine manufacturer has no liability for any side effects or death. @MattHancock please stop taking us for idiots. Keep yr poison.
132	108966	250,000 people in the U.K. have volunteered and are in trials for the coronavirus vaccine, is it just me that thinks they are crazy
133	108224	Why a vaccine for a virus less deadly than flu? And why give flu vaccines when effective rate is so low? Viruses mutate. Vaccines cannot keep up with mutations. Are vaccines a way to accomplish Agenda2021 &amp; Agenda2030? Heard of Georgia Guidestones? Research &amp; trust in Jesus now!
134	108799	@BBCBreakfast We need to do all we can to stop the Spread of Coronavirus until the Vaccine makes us safe
135	111238	@DancerDad @zxcvbnlkjhgf The #COVID19 virus has not never been in circulation is hidden in the vaccine explains why they want you all vaccinated , so you think am just bs you all the timejust wait you will see soon enough#CovidVaccinehttps://t.co/Hxnva1j7qH
136	110642	@GovMikeDeWine When are you going to wake up Governor?The cure has always been here and vaccines are not necessary.  It can be taken profolacticly and protects against other viruses too.I voted for you, but make no mistake, I will never vote for you or John H. ever again!
137	109520	That's what herd immunity is all about: those that are physically unable (not paranoid conspiracists -- they don't get a pass) to receive the vaccine are then protected because everyone else got it.
138	111122	Lockdowns never work lol same with vaccines. History tells us the only way out of this is letting everyone get the virus. Survival of the fittest.
139	110812	Preparing us for when we're allowed to drive only on certain days.Wakey-wakey!Reject the vaccine certificate. It's the gateway to the social credit system the NZ govt. has planned; like the one used to control all citizens in China.#Covid19NZ #LockdownNZ #NZPol #NoVaxCertNZ
140	112940	reports here are stating that people are saying if you give me the vaccine for Coronavirus for free I'll take it. well they do give vaccines for free in supermarkets here, it is generally for the flu and while they get the vaccines that are kept on Ice they  r generally 2 yrs old
141	202209	Tomorrow morning I’m getting my first COVID-19 vaccination. If you get called, please do likewise. Too many people have died because of this thing. #GetVaccinated #CovidVaccine
142	111954	It can’t be commented on or liked, but it can be retweeted. #brazil offers their citizens an alternative way to treat #COVID19.And it’s working. Big pharma wants you to think the #vaccine is the only way. It’s not. So Twitter will try to make sure you don’t see this.
143	111414	Yeah this is fucking terrible the cons won't spend money on a safe and efficient rollout so it's gonna end up costing the healthcare system more with this patchwork raggedy process they are making up as they go along. Deplorable. I'll be lucky to get a vaccine this year 🤷
144	110560	I would attend with limited seating, mandatory masks and sanitizer readily available.  No Covid Vaccine is going in my body, they can't even get the flu vaccine right from year to year !
145	108665	The day they said there is vaccine with great efficacy against a coronavirus which we still don’t know its origin is when I said this whole pandemic is fishy.
146	107981	@realDonaldTrump if this is true then SHAME ON YOU!!!! I WILL NOT BE FORCIBLY VACCINATED!!!! Esp not with a vaccine that has bypassed ALL safety testing and measures!!!! Put me in jail or kill me, I will not be forced to do anything against my will!!
147	112101	I had the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine over a month ago and had no side affects. I would still take the chance on the J&amp;J vaccine. The risks are low considering the risk of coronavirus. Just happy I am vaccinated and all my loved ones are too or in the process.
148	112186	@chocolatemani12 @Trickyjabs @Rachael_Swindon Blocked. Something I meant to do but never got round to.  Every #FBPE will be blocked - liars, cheats, charlatans.  Hope you are enjoying the racist brexit you enabled and the added bonus of the Johnson covid-19 cull.I don't need to block peoplesvote they disappeared completely.
149	108403	... the currently available vaccinations for protection against respiratory illnesses do NOT protect against coronavirus. COVID-19 is such a new and unique pathogen that it requires its own vaccine, and researchers are currently working on one targeted for coronavirus. (2/2)
150	112292	@Independent Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines.

153	110262	Very proud day!The #OxfordVaccine is safe, effective, ethical. It can be store in a standard fridge, will be provided on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic across the world, &amp; in perpetuity to low -and middle- income countries. Congrats to #oxfordastrazeneca!
154	108461	Getting my COVID-19 vaccine this weekend! I had to go with the J&amp;J because of the fact I’m still healing and I can’t miss work if I get sick with a second dose. Honestly at this point I’m just happy to get it done and over with.
155	108972	This is interesting could our whole government be involved in a coverup an have had answers. They all seem guilty an the whole virus vaccine mess gets bigger my doc waits 4 days for test results by then u could be vented. Can’t get vaccines for 4 months.  https://t.co/pz9vN9Qaes

160	112730	@mjrowland68 @GregHuntMP @BreakfastNews Don't you think it's rather strange that the flu vaccine is compulsory for aged care workers but the coronavirus isn't?
161	111475	@LexyDKat @SheriLoCascio @mimimcg07 The science is there. A commitment to safety via nationwide vaccine is not there. This virus has been allowed to mutate. Just as a person vaccinated against the flu can get the flu, a person vaxxed against Covid-19 can get the virus, since it also mutates.

174	110322	Vaccines are massive money making machines for pharma companies. They are more lucrative than cures-because you sell cures to only the sick; but you sell vaccines to the healthy. And the best part-no liability!Next they will try selling insulin to everyone-not just diabetics.
175	108314	Because it's contagious, no PPE, no vaccines, we really can't socially distance CAUSE IT'S HANDS ON CARE, our industry isn't funded, again no PPE (we did get underwear masks), no real testing. We had a heads-up from Wuhan, but it is just the flu. So sick of this.

180	111129	You denied us Super Computer, thinking we will never make it. We did.You denied us Cryogenic Engine, thinking we will never make it.We did.You are denying us Raw Materials for COVID19 Vaccines, thinking we will not be able to make it.Guess what, we will make it again.@POTUS
181	110539	I don't think I could find anyone willing to take the bet that this vaccine will get EUA for kids because it will 💯% get done so we have to wait until November why? But seriously if you want to take the other side I'll give you $1000000:1 odds.
182	107895	It’s not legally a vaccine. It’s not fda approved and it doesn’t prevent you from catching or spreading the “virus” not to mention there’s no liability. #whatsthepoint
183	109104	@US_FDA authorization for #COVID19 Vaccine! It passed muster with @FDACBER Chief Peter Marks (my residency peer &amp; my first boss in industry), he has the highest scientific and ethical integrity - should give us all great confidence!  Keep up the masks, distance &amp; hygiene
184	110057	@MarkELindsay He and other doctors like him are making it really hard for the rest of us trying to convince our patients that COVID-19 is REAL and the vaccine WORKS.My question is, what is next beyond disliking posts like his? will any institute or association stand up to people like him?
185	110377	Mmm just tells me it doesn’t work , they prob just giving us the flu jab and more proof you can’t just whip up a vaccine in a couple of months .... these lot are so transparent
186	202263	@thefactualprep Good! My 100 year old Grandma got over Covid-19 with less symptoms than I'd have expected from a normal flu, and my other grandma got her first dose of the vaccine.

189	112201	@NHLFlyers tomorrow is my birthday. Was planning on seeing you guys at climate pledge arena against the kraken. Would've been my first time seeing you guys live. Unfortunately just tested positive for covid19 despite being vaxxed. Please win  tomorrow night 👍🏒🤜🤛

193	202030	I get my second shot of the covid-19 vaccine tomorrow. I heard the 2nd one can end up making you feel tired and achy so I built a stew tonight so I could just take it easy for the next couple of days if I had to. Stew came out ok!

197	109706	@unbeatabletweet @MollyJongFast Imagine an extremely bad flu with a polio chaser and no guarantee of developed immunity. That basically sums up Covid-19 but there's no vaccine to prevent it, the plasma treatment only minimizes symptoms in about 76% cases.
198	108527	@sdr_medco @thomaskaine5 CoVid-19 is not gone. It will be with us until a vaccine is developed. Until then I'm wearing my mask whenever I cannot stay within social distancing standards.

200	111859	Ford gov’t produced a doodle video explaining distribution because they knew they’re in trouble. They didn’t explain the ‘buffer’ in their video. The ‘buffer’ is a choice @fordnation made, and he also didn’t explain why vaccines aren’t going to high priority areas first.
201	110237	@mom1247 @DougSha44869139 @IngrahamAngle We will suffer through this indefinitely because a number of politicians enjoy the absolute control that they are currently experiencing.

203	110979	@MrChristian22 @KeeblrD @TheOctoberMan__ @mikepompeo Covid-19 is the 19th Corona virus (SARS) originating in 1965. The reason they were able to create vaccines so quickly is that epidemiologis have been working on various SARS vaccines for decades.

214	108842	@beltlinkworld @marenaltman The New York Times: “The vaccine won’t stop evolving when the vaccine arrives. The coronavirus is not a shape shifter like the flu virus, but it could become vaccine-resistant over time.This is called Vaccine Escape. Ironically, giving people the jab makes the virus mutate.”

218	111856	Despite the badmouthing propaganda, all I see is China sending out vaccine (past 2 billion doses) while America has sent out an eighth and the Europeans even less...when are the propagandists going to step up with some action to match the hot air...
219	110190	I've had a friend who had this recently, not associated with the vaccine.  (He'd never get the vaccine voluntarily.)This blood disorder WILL kill you.  Covid may not.
220	110082	Does anyone know how vaccine passports will work if you don't have the NHS Covid-19 app? My phone isn't compatible with the app, would I just show my vaccination card instead?
221	108109	@tiredofthecon @JCalabrese9 @SandyInPlover @DanCrenshawTX And u are a true clown because there is no cure for a virus so explain again why u are vaccinating lol because they told u to, go house up with some illegals I'm sure your vaccine will protect u, the vaccine made the covid-19 virus mutate into the Delta varient 🤔
222	109018	How awful.They are going to kill humanity with sadness, and they will blame the virus. #COVID19 #NoVaccine
223	109656	@AlistairHaimes I have thought past it. We won't get a significantly vaccine-escaping Coronavirus.Just as when we vaccinated against Influenza, another mild respiratory virus will evolve nasty attributes to take it's place. One we won't be vaccinated against.Perhaps an Adenovid-25?
224	108404	@RaymondRoentgen @RepThomasMassie One in five Americans believes the US government is using the COVID-19 vaccine to microchip the population.SCOFF. NO vax is 100% and with vax deniers spreading and allowing variants - THEY are the sick ones spreading disease.
225	109675	@StockTalk416 I bet these are the same people (frankly, idiots) who think Bill Gates put microchips in vaccines so he can, idk track you? Think Covid-19 is just the flu and vaccines in general will kill you, or something dumb like that.
226	112605	“Out here in the real world, COVID-19 is very much to be feared. There is no magic cure and no vaccine. Injecting disinfectant won’t stop it. Neither will denial. And we elders are the likeliest to die because the president is a reckless misleader.”

228	110364	Lol....Fake News. There is no real WHO investigation. They can only go where the Chinese say they can go, and they can only speak to who the Chinese say they can speak to, not to mention the Chinese have had 12 months to vaccine clean all the evidence.
229	110878	@WhiteHouse @JoeBiden 1. Why are American taxpayers funding the Trump ‘voter fraud’ actions when the outcome will not change (except @realDonaldTrump loses twice) 2. If Covid-19 is a hoax, will ‘like a miracle’ disappear, why is Trump bragging about a Vaccine ? No one needs ☝️
230	108518	Flippy floppy but he's right no one can force you to take the vaccine so stand up and stop being a little blank
231	112668	@FreeBeYouMe @bucketwoman0 @sailorrooscout The polio vaccine is non-sterilizing (you’ll not get sick but you may be a little infectious) but it obviously works very well.Our bodies will know Covid19 well enough to regularly fend off severe infections.(That‘s why a missionary visiting a remote tribe/island is a murderer)
232	112621	@theprojecttv It won’t just protect hospitals but saves lives, unnecessary panic etc!Even with a vaccine we’ll need early treatment options. What the hell are we waiting for?
233	108144	Don't take any Coronavirus vaccine. It's poison and is bad for the body and soul. It will also cause infertility #youhavebeenwarned
234	109480	It’s bad enough to ban the COVID vaccine to ‘own the libs,’ but ban ALL vaccines? @ohiogop has lost any standing as a legitimate party just to appease the wackos.
235	111529	Isn't it just a little concerning that politicians seem convinced we'll have a COVID19 vaccine within a year, because we are so good at making vaccines these days...  But there's no AIDS vaccine despite decades of work trying to make one.
236	107769	Somebody is lying to us why ?. If we develop a vaccine it will only work once,coronavirus mutate that’s why we need a new flu vaccine every year, And still people die and that’s with an effective vaccine,we can’t stop old people dying at the end of their lives

240	110292	@lyndsay_hopkins @janekin24 @SirGrahamBrady This has been bewildering for a year. Why r some calling it covid, others coronavirus, the Pfizer injection called a vaccine when it is a synthetic pathogen, amazingly can now be given 3 months apart rather than the recommended 3 weeks? This is all made up stuff on a daily basis.
241	112041	"So I guess my only question is like how many of the people who say they definitely won't get the vaccines (1) Actually won't and (2) Have already had Corona and whether that like ""natural immunity"" can help with the herd immunity?"

243	111865	@YardleyShooting There's plenty of scientists abd medics not wanting this vaccine. It doesn't make us anti vaxxers 🙄 those at real risk from coronavirus are also at risk of this vaccine. I think they'd be better just improving their immunity. But if they want to take it there choice
244	109608	@realDonaldTrump Fake news they are only just beginning testing, but WHY WOULD YOU CARE? Trump has always called the coronavirus a HOAX. So this must be a HOAX ( a Vaccine)

260	109578	@vKarl @sboumedi If the illness does not confer immunity then why are the experts racing to make a vaccine. There is, on the face of it, no reason to believe infection does not cause future immunity. It's *a* coronavirus, one of the commonest infecting agents in the world.

264	110191	The coronavirus is just a virus like the common cold. Why don’t we just start with the cold vaccine and modify it a little bit to work with coronavirus?
265	109257	@VP You are aware that the vaccine only makes it so YOU won't show symptoms. There also isn't a 100% chance that if you get COVID-19 it will stop you from spreading it to other people. There is also a chance you can still get COVID after being vaccinated.
266	111548	So my partners sister is anti vax, only one in a big family who is against it,along with her husband, she went crying to her mother,I've lost my job,I can't go anywhere, what do I do? Mother said,out of all your relatives and friends,we are fine, get the jab!Poor Mum😐 #COVID19

283	110874	Fauci had Wuhan working on Sars / HIV-1C variations, hoping to develop a vaccine, follow the money, NIH funding Wuhan, why? It's a bio weapons lab? COVID-19  a targeted virus ? Fauci has lied from the start, still is lying.
284	112496	Good summative update on how things are in South Korea. I’m finally eligible to make a vaccine appt this Friday, and then will probably need to wait another month for my first dose... vaccine availability has been the biggest drag on SK’s COVID response.

302	107766	So my step son has been trying to get his second jab for  2 weeks in London and is being told London has no moderna.  You threw away 10,000 doses.  Someone is lying.  Is it you or do you have an incompetent staff?  Not sure but I would like an answer if you are throwing out doses
303	110211	So Russia is the first country to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19, but the west don’t want to acknowledge that.
304	202311	The COVID-19 vaccine is like New Mutants for me. I won't believe it exists until it's injected directly into my bloodstream

306	112630	Too bad the trudeau Liberals did not put more funding into Canadian companies working on vaccines. It worked for the UK, but trudeau does not believe in buy Canadian solutions. I wonder why that is?
307	108392	I don't get why anyone is bothering to debunk this. They think the vaccine has so called nanotechnology and demons in it who are we to say that baking soda won't remove them?Imaginary solutions can work for imaginary problems. Placebo effect!
308	111035	@JohnnyTwoTs @Timcast it's not cool, your risking others lives. why not try to increasing body immunity and take the vaccines, we can do both. My community along with the black community is effected the most in coronavirus. Why are we approaching such a great achievement as govt tyranny?
309	109807	contact with in general. We are all RESPONSIBLE to do our parts. We ALL play a PIVOTAL ROLE in combating Covid19 until a vaccine is on hand. Pls, Don't lull yourselves into thinking, it can't happen to me or mine. Stay safe, keep healthy, you and your live(s) ARE IMPORTANT. 🙂
310	110081	In the case of #COVID19 how does the Government distinguish between want and need?It is a ridiculous statement. Everyone needs the vaccine. Everyone has a fundamental right to life and health. @narendramodi @PMOIndia please give vaccine to all.

313	110069	@johnpavlovitz You cannot eradicate this virus any other way than with my free salt water cure, which kills off Coronavirus, BEFORE it is allowed to become Covid, during self isolation. Vaccines just don't work - RichardNoakes19 for my cure. It is simple enough to do, see for yourself it works
314	110502	What do you think the odds are that a coronavirus vaccine appears in record time, everybody lines up for the vaccine, few people then succumb to the coronavirus (unaware they likely would not have succumbed regardless) &amp; the vaccine cabal claims success?🤷🏻‍♀️
315	111399	Coronavirus jabs could become compulsory for NHS staff, the vaccines minister has confirmed. Do you think it should be compulsory for NHS staff to get the vaccine? #Politics #Vaccine #Coronavirus

320	110592	Everything Covid-19 is a lie. It's really that simple and you idiots ran out to get a vaccine that the so blatantly obvious corrupt media and government told you to get. I really hope you'll be OK but I do believe you had a better chance of surviving the so called virus.
321	109351	@nikoCSFB I got the Pfizer mostly out of pressure, but I'm also a front line worker who has likely already had Covid19. So knowing I've had the shot and my immune system has dealt with this virus I feel confident not getting the booster.
322	108122	"@advovolicious Sistreni. My advice is, ""if you have HIV/Immunocompromised"" (we all know the HIV numbers in SA), then DON'T TAKE the Covid-19 vaccine shot 💉.Maybe that's what explains the situations you have talked about re folks affected by vaccines.For everyone else, 'Rona Vaccine is safe!"

325	108180	For what? Let them die if they don’t want to wear a mask or get the vaccine, start having people sign waivers and refuse medical care when they get sick
326	109005	@CathyBilsky @mmpadellan Oh please. The vaccines don’t have any virus or other infectious material in them. They cause your body to make copies of a harmless piece of the coronavirus, so you will not, and cannot, get COVID-19 from the vaccine.
327	109059	This will clear the wrong notion surrounding this matter and put the facts in place that the covid19 vaccines are still under clinical human trials and those so-called vaccinated are human test subjects to this whole process whether voluntarily or forcibly done.
328	110997	What good is testing if Covid-19 has a high re-infection rate?  That does not make sense especially if there is no immunity to the virus.  Will a vaccine even work?

331	108515	@AndraszTim @engc9k @JamesTodaroMD Previous Coronavirus vaccines brought a good antibody level in ferrets but the issue was when they were exposed to a different strain,  bec. they developed an immunoreactivity and they all died.Asymptomatics respond with a good cell immunity not dumb specific antibody immunity.
332	111913	Attention: DO NOT TAKE THE COVID VACCINE. The vaccine will contain a chip, the chip will allow the government to track and spy on your every MOVE. Soon we will not be able to buy food or water if we don't obey the government. DO NOT TAKE THE VACCINE.#COVID19 #CovidVaccine #COVID

No, it's just my personal experience, but certainly enough to observe first hand the problem exists and Covid19 is very unpredictable, varying drastically from person to person.
336	109288	"@SidtheKidd87 @realDonaldTrump Apparently you need this spelled out for you!The seasonal flu has a vaccine, millions get shots for it and don't get it.

353	112707	@drcraigwax @DrHirschfield @CDCDirector @CDCgov @somedocs That is the reason we should not rush people into taking this vaccine. There is a reason we could never make a Coronavirus vaccine up until the moment we conveniently could skip the animal studies. Same reason the Deng vaccine got terminated. The antibody dependent enhancement.
354	111848	I’ll never understand why people get so angry towards people who don’t want the vaccine or haven’t gotten it yet. Like, get a job

421	112504	Hey, guys, I know I said that I would be streaming tonight, but I recently got the COVID-19 vaccine and my arm has been hurting pretty bad. I promise my steaming schedule will be back to normal next week. Thank you guys for waiting! 😊
422	110443	@msanonymousme There will never be herd immunity if reports from Hong Kong are correct. It seems someone who survived Covid-19 now has it again. We need a vaccine. Period!
423	202414	SF residents: you may be eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine today, even if you aren’t under State guidelines.I am and on Tuesday, 366 days after the State of California’s first shelter order, I will get vaccinated to protect myself and my community. Beginning of the end 🙌
424	108756	Yup. So ppl please, don't go vaccine shopping if you are offered Moderna. Moderna is as good as Pfizer. We cannot do vaccine shopping in the middle of a public health crisis.
425	108706	According to Donald Trump, the coronavirus, labelled #COVID19, will die out once temperatures increase. And since when is he such an expert on virology? We're not 100% safe until we develop a solid defense, i.e. a cure and/or vaccine, fact, seriously shut this buffoon up already.
426	107834	Before any progress can be made against the Coronavirus, we must be rid of Trump. I don't care how it's done but he has to be dragged out kicking and screaming as we know he will. It has to be done now as we are running out of lives and the time it takes to secure a vaccine.

428	112065	@YouthfulScrub @MoAfrica_ @CNN We don't have any coronavirus vaccine approved for use. The Oxford vaccine which is being tested is one of what is considered the most promising. All the test monkeys contracted the virus.
429	110343	Herd immunity's key to humanity's evolvement as a species.Yet we couldn't talk about it. Were ridiculed and told lockdowns are only way until a vaccine.We're the most advanced civilizations in history and two-bit political and science advisor thugs have you living in fear.🤦‍♂️

431	111951	To protect Europeans, the EU must help protect the🌍. Only when priority populations in all countries have access to vaccines will Covid-19 come under control.We know it. In a pandemic, no one is safe until everyone, everywhere, is safe. No export bans🚫Yes to more infoℹ️
432	110146	I wonder if this is happening in other countries. Either way, the vaccine should be offered to those of us who want it before they’re no longer useable.
433	109026	"@RealCandaceO ""IT MAKES NO SENSE"" only if you fail to grasp that:1. There is a flu vaccine but no novel coronavirus vaccine.2. This coronavirus is far more contagious and lethal than the flu.3. Unlike the flu, no one is immune to the coronavirus.4. Social distancing + masks = fewer deaths."
434	111820	So then will there be another “booster?”Of course there will. It will never end until people just say no.
435	112860	in. Maybe because I tensed you? The needle was so tiny it looked like an insulin syringe 💉. The jab of the needle was painless, that burning though!  No I’ll effects, so is my body not working w/the vaccine? Ty to anyone for any legit info! #Covid19 #Covid19Vax
436	110692	If all goes according to plan, I will be getting my first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine this Thursday! (I won’t know which one until I get there.)
437	108815	@jonathanfuhrman @ClayTravis Coronavirus has so animal reservoirs that, even if 100% of the global population were to be vaxxed complete with monthly boosters, it will NEVER stop mutating. Mutations have nothing to do with 40-50% of the population being unvaxxed.
438	109935	@cnni Just now GOD/ALLAH/SHIV has suggested one mentioned below vaccine for this Coronavirus ---------  Don't visit any Church, Mosque &amp; Temple...until you permanently QUIT Smoking, Alcohol, Drug, PORN, Premarital Sex/Extramarital affairs.
439	110238	@NBCNews So Republicans said the coronavirus was a democratic hoax, now they want credit for the coronavirus vaccine. The Republicans want to keep appointing judges, but don't wanna pass the democrats #HeroesAct because it'll give money to the people they secretly hire under the table.
440	110570	After Bihar, Tamil Nadu follows suit. Free vaccine for all, even before we have a vaccine? #BiharElections2020 #TamilNadu

442	108204	the coronavirus at all. This vaccine uses its specific proteins to cut down on all the proteins that the body brings in, allowing the natural and important proteins to come in, but not allowing dangerous ones like the virus. The reason the vaccine has any effects after (cont.)
443	201890	@rabiasquared Yes! I was diagnosed with COVID19, just this week. I have had all my vaccinations so the symptoms are mild. When a booster comes out and my doctor says I need it, believe me I will get the booster. This virus is a SOB!

445	111596	"This is a great idea.However, the real debate is: ""Do you control your body?""All this stuff about novel coronavirus and ""vaccines"" is really about ""Do you have bodily autonomy?"" This is about the DNC Party getting to tell you to get shot up with -- whatever the Party wants."
446	108294	after hoarding the vaccine and withholding the information for countries to make their own...wonder what the catch is tbh.
447	110947	@JenJJams @IlhanMN How many people lost their jobs during the pandemic and how many Americans are facing eviction? Trump did nothing. He said that he’ll not take responsibility for the spreading of coronavirus. Now he wants to take credit of the vaccine. He did nothing.
448	108405	@stephenasmith Ok thanks means more money in MY pockets! Not getting ANY vaccine!Don’t worry 10 years from now when I’m watching late night television it will be announced that my family may be entitled to a lump sum settlement if the have taken the Covid-19 vaccine or the booster shot😝😝😝😝
449	111462	Ffs I would quite like my 65+ year old dad who's had bypass surgery to get the vaccine before 25 year old, broadly healthy me
450	109717	@Shaunemms @UKCovid19Stats Nope it can’t. But it can’t be left unchecked. Lockdown brought it right down. Opening up has caused it to rise. We need a vaccine and I’m not sure we will get one. Of the four known coronavirus in humans I don’t believe we hav one
451	111437	@frankscarpitti @JohnTory @BonnieCrombie @patrickbrownont A politician who is thinks nothing about destroying small businesses and is oblivious to the fact that there has never been a vaccine for coronavirus. Masks forever, thanks to Frank.
452	109107	@seanhannity I think you're a little misinformed Sean you're allowed to work for Chicago if you decided to not use the vaccine Chicago just wants to know how often are you being tested for the coronavirus he must test every week has nothing to do with choice
453	201967	@pfizer_news @BioNTech_Group TOO ALL THE EXECUTIVE WITHIN THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE ARE DEVELOPING A VACCINE FOR COVID-19 I HAVE MADE YOU AWARE OF MY PRESENCE THAT YOU SEEM TO DISREGARD AND MAYBE NOT BELIEVE MY WORDS SO LET ME SHOW YOU WHO I AM AND MAKE YOU AWARE

457	109703	"@TL3_SME @doinkershnauzz @dmzastra @elonmusk @StateDept The ""vaccine"" youre talking about is a drug called remedesevir. Also it only affects the RNA of the coronavirus, not human cells. Plus many antibiotics work in the same way. So dont take them either and die to common bacterial infection"
458	111911	@TFGH is a fantastic NGO working on vaccine equity. If anyone is interested, also consider reaching out to them.
459	108548	@RonFilipkowski My sister took vitamins, got COVID-19 before vaccine. Hospitalized, but survived with long term effects.
460	201982	@MadFloofCat @Rufusmay Yes student OT here &amp; had my 1st Hepatitis B vaccine yesterday - have to have before placements next year. Is it to do with people not thinking Covid-19 one is safe? xx
461	108556	@NSWRFS Why? It’s a proven fact the vaccine does not protect you from getting COVID19 , a virus with an OVER 99% survivability rate if you do get it, or from spreading COVID19.
462	112171	@SenatorRounds Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
463	202003	Booked my Covid19 booster jab online. Looks like I'll be going somewhere new from my last 2 jabs. Long drive but worth it. Don't wait for a letter. GET IT DONE.
464	107719	I'm an obese who has had my first jab a few weeks ago and as of today had my first free doughnut.It's a nice thing. Forget the haters.
465	202159	Good morning all, had my coronavirus vaccine yesterday, having some bad side effects, feel so shitty, so I’m going to have a day off today!💕
466	112935	@ActualidadRT Great job China, but people are still sick and dying, and a vaccine for the coronavirus does not yet exist and the help offered by the US did not want to accept it 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
467	110477	@irishecko @JohannSchultz7 @Breaking911 What’s the law for the coronavirus vaccine? Also you never answered why do you care if I don’t get it if you get it?
468	112667	Fucking hell like, how can he not rule it out?! Absolutely no fucking chance would I have a mandatory vaccine. They’re taking the piss out of us.
469	109179	When this “man” gives up the monetary incentive he has for ALL to be vaccinated.. maybe we’ll listen but not until!!  This is the man that made millions on HIV?!?  Wake up people!! Fauci makes money on every single vaccine!!
470	109545	That moment when helpful treatments get shutdown so they can kill you with there vaccine…..I wonder if by the summer they will ban you from walking in the sun because VitD IS GOOD FOR YOUR IMMUNITY 🤔#Madness #COVID19 #europeansunited
471	111988	If there would be an inevitable demand for this vaccine, private industries would take on all the risk and invest their own money into creating a vaccine. No burden to the tax payer. Smh
472	111508	@FaheemYounus How about cross-immunity after having several times vaccine for seasonal influenza? Or do they not count cause one has had to have some #coronavirus infection to get some immunity against #SARSCoV2 ?I don't know if influenza vaccinations in Finland include #coranavirus'es.
473	107874	Hardly anyone is seriously going to quit their jobs over something trivial like vaccine requirement. We can mandate these everywhere, no problem
474	111661	@fmanjoo The Daily had what I thought was pretty condescending episode yesterday on how some people will probably not get the Coronavirus vaccine when it comes out. But... in these circumstances, suspicion towards a vaccine that comes out in this regime seems very reasonable.
475	111422	@Rothbard1776 NyQuil lessons the symptoms of colds, all kinds of cold, not just coronavirus colds… so is this vaccine at least as good as NyQuil? 🤡 If “providing protection” from a virus makes you a vaccine, then isn’t NyQuil a vaccine too? Like a 12 hour vaccine! 🤡
476	110491	Lmfao @ ppl posting how they won’t take a vaccine for a coronavirus bc they haven’t found a cancer vaccine for all cancers. Do you understand anything? Lol. It’s hard not to laugh 🤡
477	108861	"There we have it again: ""The vaccine is our way out"" = Vaccine macht Frei. Where is the difference to hitler now?"
478	109285	Still relatively low numbers, but looks like increasing again in Munich as well...as everywhere in Germany &amp; Europe. Stay safe, don't neglect hygiene &amp; social distancing rules!! Takes time until we have efficient vaccines.
479	109533	Tgese are very very underreported.Hank Aaron just took the vaccine 2 weeks ago. I have heard an immunogist say deaths will occur 2 to 3 months after the thanatos vax
480	107857	@WalshFreedom And the vaccine at this point in time is the only way to some kind of freedom and will ensure the hospital system will not close their doors to everyone, not just COVID. Don’t forget SARS and MERS are a coronavirus so scientists have been researching these vaccines for years.
481	110639	@TVNewsHQ @realDonaldTrump @JesseBWatters Why China try to steal from low grades while China herself is far advanced in Covid19 vaccine?   How stupid that would be?
482	110241	A vaccine for the #coronavirus or going dark for #EarthHour I wonder which one is more important 🤔🤦🏻‍♂️
483	110705	I don’t know why this in particular has me shocked considering what I know about the Trump administration and how vaccine distribution has been going so far, but like..... wow.
484	109053	@DonaldJTrumpJr I don't see the reason why a Vaccine Passport is needed. When you get your vaccine you get a CDC issued COVID-19 Vaccination Card. Once you get your first dose, you'll be issued a vaccine card. The vaccine card will have the name of the vaccine, the date received and where got it
485	108366	No idea how to feel about this, except to add that I am still in a nearly month long wait to get my booster shot in the neighborhood with grad student housing.
486	109839	Coronavirus already came around once this it's 2nd time this fall n winter will be 3 but then we're going to be against the vaccine that's going to harm our children from our daughters not being able to conceive n our sons with low sperm count
487	110111	@dugdale1863 @LPrivileged @Conservatives @MattHancock @nadhimzahawi You obviously aren't seen the amount of coming forward after the vaccine having #COVID19 like i said even hospitalized i don't get why @MattHancock is being silent about post-vaccine POSITIVES there are hundreds if not thousands #ToryScum #ToriesOUT #QuitHancock
488	201903	Welp, this might be itMy grandma who i’m very close with just got Covid-19We’re one room apart, and she’s living with my family rnI hope that she’s okay, she’s double vaxxed + boosters , but I haven’t gotten the booster yet and my vaccine was almost a year agoWish us luck
489	112603	@Cherry3142today @BernieSanders This is the equivalent of, 'I got coronavirus and survived, so no one should get a vaccine after me. They should suffer like I did.' If you understand the pain of debt, have some empathy for those who are still suffering.
490	108897	@JoeBiden Yeah get vaccinated then catch the Coronavirus because this vaccine don't work so shut the hell up president With Your lies
491	111962	To all the News Media’s said Trump would not get a vaccine for COVID-19 within a year like he promised and he’s delivered two...WHEN are y’all going to say Thank you President Trump? You may not like him but he delivered!!!  If you can’t say it to Trump don’t take it his vaccine
492	111074	"""These vaccines are only associated by the name"". If someone is dealing with an autocratic or totalitarian regime such as Putin's they will always be duped. Always. It may sound absolute; yes! for some reason it is ""Always"". Just don't do it."
493	108722	#aktuonlinexam But @vpathakin says that he has consulted with every college affiliated to aktu . So , i assume our college director's voices are suppressed ...🙄Because my college director supports online exams and teaching till everyone gets vaccine or covid-19 ceases.
494	110386	So please explain to the EDUCATED!  WTF in AMERICA does -90F freezers exist???  If you choose to READ, this is the SO CALLED vaccine messiah for SARScov2 (Covid 19) SOLUTION!  I HERD we will just be exposed by HERD IMMUNITY by intentional BIOLOGICAL Super Spread Rallies  NOT ME!

498	108547	Will you get the Coronavirus vaccine when it becomes available??It’s a HUGE no from me!!! #coronavirus #CoronavirusVaccine #COVID19 #NoVaccine
499	112712	@CNN So its as effective as the yearly flu vaccine we all are supposed to get. Doesn't guarantee immunity, but is enough to suppress it till next year.In other words, the coronavirus vaccine may be just another flu vaccine. A yearly dose to keep the immune system chuggin along.
500	112498	No I don't want a shit vaccine that only does 2/3 of the job. I've played the columns on a roulette table many times &amp; lost. Why are Australians getting a vaccine that only has 62% efficacy? #auspol #COVID19 #coronavirus
501	112617	@BartlettChrisJ @Gurdur the entire economy on the prospect of a suitable coronavirus vaccine in any particular time frame.  If we get one, great, but I think it would be unwise to count on it.
502	112436	"@LexiLan18078330 @Oregonian @MrAndyNgo COVID-19 ""vaccines"" are designed to do is reduce your symptoms if or when you get infected. They are not designed to prevent infection, they do not give you immunity against SARS-CoV-2,"

504	112531	@ntsikimazwai Comparing Covid-19 and HIV is done deliberately to get us talking, awake, and eventually to get why the government is forcing us to take the vaccine! Why taking the vaccine still don't immune one from getting Covid-19 and spreading it!

508	111794	Kids don't get affected by #COVID19 Less than 100 kids died in the whole world ( out of Billions of people)But they want to force kids to take the #CoronaVaccine WHY ????Is it because they want to make Money Off Vaccines Or is it even more sinister LIKE A SLOW DEATH
509	108922	The flu vaccine will not provide protection against the Coronavirus but can help ensure you don’t end up with a weakened immune system leaving you susceptible to other infections such as the Coronavirus. Please contact us on 01633 612438 to make an appointment.
510	110813	Did Fauci and Walensky seriously just say that if you get vaccinated and are hit by a car after, a doctor is going to fill out a Vaccine Adverse Event  report and the CDC is going to adjudicate that an adverse reaction to a vaccine?  Can they show us such reports?
511	202245	Yesterday I have received my second anti- COVID-19 vaccine! On both occasions everything went very smoothly, I m feeling fine! A big thanks to the Hungarian health service for its  hard work against the virus!

513	109259	After they’ve messed up literally *every* part of the response to the virus, they put this incompetent idiot in charge of rolling out the vaccine. Don’t make any plan before 2024 at this rate 🤦🏻
514	108580	@PinoyAkoBlog @attyharryroque @attyharryroque if not for your BFF China there is no need for Covid-19 vaccine
515	111530	I think that we should give the COVID-19 vaccine to all the people in death row so they can be the  guinea pig for all of us. Doctor and nurse should not get it because if they get it and die who is going to take care of us??#COVID19 #vaccines #DEATHROW #oppion #Colorado
516	107956	What did people want trump to do when coronavirus came to the u.s.? Did they want him to get into a laboratory and start making the vaccine.  Blaming him for everything is ridiculous.  It was NECESSARY to shut the country down.

521	112581	Didn’t Justin Trudeau say that the vaccines would arrive in Spring? they’re acting like herd vaccination is going to be possible when studies have found less than half of the population would actually get the vaccination and feels comfortable with it.
522	111493	-Mikola, you wanna take the vax?-No. -Everyone must take it. -I will not. -Next variant can be deadly.-I dont care, I've already have had the virus.Now in Ukraine they use non scientific information to inflict fear, to make people take the vaccine.#COVID19
523	111319	Those people who don't believe there's a #COVID19 virus, or it's *just* 'flu because they don't know anyone personally who has died from it. However, although they don't know anyone personally who's died, the vaccine is a killer. A form of eugenics 🤯
524	109155	@Steele_Ink @HarleyPeyton @DanCrenshawTX So ADE has not been seen in COVID-19 vaccines, but it has been seen in RSV, measles and the dengue vaccine
525	112150	I personally do not blindingly trust the Covid-19 vaccines like the silver bullet. This is due to all vaccines we have are not perfect ones and at the same time, the coronavirus has aggressively evolved and mutating all the times, and these viruses seem to never give up, but they
526	111675	This is true with COVID-19 “vaccines,” as the shots do not make you immune; you can still get infected, and they do not prevent you from spreading the virus if you’re infected.
527	111489	So their vaccine reduced the absolute risk of covid by .24%.The world will end unless we get everyone hurdled into camps until they get these vaccines.
528	107812	@JonathanTorren9 @cmyeaton Did you know that we have never made a vaccine for a coronavirus successfully in humans? Most were mild. Only SARS and MERS were attempted to my knowledge. Both unsuccessful.
529	109896	I keep wondering why i feel like crap then i remember i had the maderna coronavirus vaccine yesterday. #Covid_19Glad,but yuk emoji.
530	109362	Even after the vaccine for covid-19 comes out it’s going to be so hard for the pandemic to come to an end when a majority of Republicans/white people are anti-vaxxers lol
531	108197	My guess is the next thing the NDP will do is trot out Don Davies to cast doubt on the effectiveness of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine. Their TDS is so out of control that they’ll flirt with vaccine hesitancy. Watch. #cdnpoli #covid19
532	112751	@SihleMahamba @tshudi_alpheus Who said a vaccine is 100% effective? I said it 5 times now: You CAN still get coronavirus if you got the vaccine. It's just a lot more unlikely.
533	110359	Doesn’t matter how good our recovery rate is, India has failed miserably to contain the virus. The only country not showing any sign of slowing down and our PM is not giving any reaction to the exams    scheduled for next week. DOOMED til vaccines arrives. #COVID19India
534	111755	@ntvuganda 2 these days when we have not yet received the vaccine for coronavirus we can not be excited

539	202071	One dose of #Covid19 vaccine only provides around 30% protection against #DeltaVariant maximum. I don't know who told @NYCMayor only one dose of the vaccine is needed but it's misinformation. People need BOTH DOSES and to wait two weeks after last dose to be fully vaccinated.
540	110389	So, my dad has been given his first jab of one of the COVID-19 vaccines.He's no the most hygienic person (always coughing and sneezing everywhere), so I just hope he doesn't give me the virus, as I've managed to avoid getting it so far.
541	202099	I just got put on the At-Risk list for the Covid vaccine. I feel a huge sense of relief! I haven't seen my grandparents in over a year. It will be SO nice to finally give them a big, fully vaccinated (masked) hug 🥰 #vaccines #vaccine #COVID19
542	201932	Very happy to be seeing the plastic #COVID19 dividers being taken DOWN at my school as teachers get their vaccine ! Still wearing our masks
543	111705	This will definitely make everyone get out there to get the vaccine. Can we stop with these articles?
544	109700	@SenRonJohnson @CDCgov Everyone who has had Covid-19 has antibodies and may not need a vaccine. After all, the claim is 1 in 3 people have had Covid in the US. That’s about 110 million of us.We are NOT vaccinated spreaders.My question is how many of the vaccinated never had covid?
545	109124	Matter of time isn’t it 😭Don’t know what people think this will achieve. Until there’s a vaccine, it will just re-surface.
546	108725	@FrancLukas1 @jennyrachelpal @realDonaldTrump I would agree with you if we had 100+ years of knowledge like we do about the flu. I would also agree with you if we had a vaccine for coronavirus. Moreover, the coronavirus death toll is already way higher than the flu.
547	112077	"Alex Berenson: ""We can go back to normal whenever we choose. It is now clear to ANYONE who watches that the coronavirus vaccines will not get us there. Not only will they not end the epidemic, their peak protection lasts a few weeks in the people who need them most."""
548	111910	@GovMurphy Did you know there's NEVER BEEN A VACCINE for a Coronavirus ? How do you handle that ?  PUT us all on Welfare ? That's what you want I'm sure. But why do YOU GET TO KEEP MAKING MONEY while WE ALL GO BANKRUPT ? WHEN YOU GIVE UP ALL FORMS OF INCOME MAYBE WE'LL LISTEN#FU
549	202165	We got vaccinated yesterday with @pfizer 1st dosis 💉 Only our arms feel sore but other than that, we feel pretty good! #vaccine #corona #covid19miami #covid19 we got it because we are asmathic! https://t.co/X0fMaJ151A
550	111188	@BadVaccineTakes I think I'm going to have to take a photo of the huge vaccine insert my GP surgery gave me, as I was getting my first COVID-19 vaccine last year

I booked it because I need to travel to work for my job and in between sites on public transport."" https://t.co/duzWqbvWN7"
552	201833	I want to frame my “I got my COVID-19 vaccine at the Loretto Hospital” pin in a shadow box beside my expired MoviePass card
553	110285	Mark my words within the next three years there will be a cull of the human race and those who have had the jabs will be the first to go.😢
554	112210	@Carl_Spackler99 @drkerrynphelps @russellcrowe There's no guarantee there *will* be a vaccine. We've never successfully made one for a coronavirus before. Yes, the social fabric will be torn apart, there'll be economic devastation and people won't tolerate it. Buckle up Dorothy, Kansas is going bye bye.
555	112354	Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine triggers immune response already won? Pelosi thinks so, and reaches for more #fakeheadlinebot #learntocode #makeatwitterbot #javascript
556	109924	@jackieohughes @RoadMeetsFeet @Outside_Margina @ClareWilsonMed @IndependentSage No, I absolutely wasn't. Please don't speak for me.And if it wasn't unique why did we not already have vaccines &amp; treatments for it? It's a novel coronavirus that gained pandemic reach.
557	112069	or, is it like what's happening here in the U.S., #vaccines made for #COVID19 may not be effective against #COVID21 #VariantsOfConcern
558	108344	@tedcruz How the hell does it make sense that You and your whole Leadership Party got the vaccine, but Will not agree to a new COVID-19 Bill? GTHOH.
559	112076	To deal with the virus, it is impossible to rely on group immunity. Vaccine is one of the most effective means. However, in the United States, the vaccine may face another problem, with one third of Americans refusing to receive the new coronavirus pneumonia vaccine.
560	108102	It’s unacceptable that disabled people aren’t prioritized for the vaccine in CA.People can’t “just stay home” when they need to attend regular doctors appointments and have to work to pay for said healthcare, especially because they’re disproportionately impoverished.
561	109902	I just received notification that I will be getting my first #COVID19 vaccine on Friday. I am so incredibly grateful for this opportunity I could cry.
562	111583	The sheer scientific feet behind this vaccine is extremely moving to read about, not only for the human ingenuity but for all the implications this technology has for cancer and other diseases
563	109796	It is RIDICULOUS they, who have denied the virus existed, took few to no precautions will get this vaccine first.  They should refuse to get it and insist it goes to local hospitals and nursing homes.
564	110935	@sarahkhan557 It’s crucial! I just learned from an Nobel laureate immunologist that the vaccine helps the body create antibodies in the bloodstream but the virus can still come in through the nose and attach to a cell as the nose has less antibodies (one would need a puffer vaccine). Video:
565	202042	Okay, although if someone told me a possible side effect of taking the covid-19 vaccine was that I might become the Incredible Hulk, it wouldn't necessarily be a deterrent. As long as my CGI was good.
566	108189	Friends, the vaccine will be available in a few short months. Hope is on the way. #PositiveVibes #Hope #coronavirus
567	110269	Not gonna blame anyone for calling this overkill on the NCAA's part, but the players/program knew the rules and risk they were taking in not getting the vaccine/educating the team. This is sad, but completely preventable. Stop turning common sense into a political debate.
568	112003	Not saying this is BS but let’s count the days until the vaccine is widely available. I think the words “incredible speed” may not mean what they think it means.
569	111216	DONALD TRUMP: I like volunteers who don't have unexplained illnesses when they get injected with vaccines that I am trying to push before the election
570	202239	"""Just take the #vaccine it's very helpful to boost your immune"" -Tanya Khatri, a volunteer who went to take the first dose of #COVID19 vaccine.#GetVaccinated #vaccinated #VaccinesSaveLives https://t.co/B7JTl9IKwU"
571	111774	This is why you shouldn’t get to gather with “just the close family” until there’s a vaccine, or until we have full containment and tracing.
572	112811	Telling students and staff who are unvaccinated that they can work remotely is not accommodation. That is segregation. There are no shades of grey here. This is black and white. I don’t understand why @SenecaCollege doesn’t believe the vaccines work. #ONpoli
573	112198	Hope it will restart soon 🙏The world 🌎 is waiting  for a safe and effective vaccine 💉 to end this pandemic and return to normalcy @adarpoonawalla
574	112853	Nigeria wasn't even qualified to get the vaccine, because they know our government lacks accountability and would only hoard or steal it. Please cancel this whole country!
575	108359	@cspanwj Wasn't going to take any COVID-19 vaccine anyway. The caller from Michigan is why people don't take vaccines. Don't lecture me on what I should  do. She complains about her neighbors not giving her an explanation. Excuse me. No one has to explain to her about their choices.
576	110427	As a vulnerable person, I think I would take the vaccine, but this is totalitarianism from a party that should know better!
577	110115	I can’t believe I (apparently) have to say this, but in the post-Tr*mp USA, apparently I do:Guys. Please don’t take medication intended to deworm livestock. 🤦‍♀️ It won’t cure your COVID. (Duh.)Get the vaccine, if you possibly can.#COVID19 #darwinaward
578	112807	Your screwing with #coronavirus to much going cause it to mutate same as when finding vaccine for Ebola but this is worse then Ebola don't be stupid keep to social distancing when it works
579	108957	@cyrii_MM I don’t think you grasp what’s happening lol Coronavirus🦠 is going/already is pandemic. It can only be stopped now by vaccine. The Globalist Order will be pricked at best. Bitcoin either goes 📈 with SoVs or it’s pretty much 💀 It’s been the leading indicator thus far, though!
580	112125	I heard if you have a Krispy Kreme right after getting the vaccine it deactivates the bill gates microchip and you just wind up protected from covid. Just something to think about...
581	109989	"Apparently there's a person in the world who knows how to stop Coronavirus. I'm all in. Tell me exactly how. Not the preventative measures that I've been taking for 5 months, but how to ""stop"" it. At the same time I'll ALSO hope for a vaccine. It's not either/or. This is so lazy"
582	112184	Please journalists follow the distribution chains. Just like 'celebrities' get special treatment and access to care, I am more than willing to imagine 'celebrities' will get special access to vaccines.....please monitor carefully.
583	110330	.@jairbolsonaro You may want to get your  delivered vaccine tested. Do it before it's too late. Speed thrills, but kills.
584	111171	@washingtonpost Americans KNOW a coronavirus vaccine will be rushed. #DonaldTrump already told us so. Why not believe him for a change. He keeps telling us who/what he is. How about we believe him finally?
585	109294	Remember all we don't have a cure or a vaccine and the virus is just as contagious as it was when this began. Please take the safe route!
586	108826	So....the vaccines are not transported in fridges? I assumed they would be to maintain the cold chain. Or is the temp in the van really low? #tarotuga
587	111626	Sony,I've already taken three vaccine shots plus a flu booster. I'm good for just $5 million.  Hell, pay my student loans off and I'm there.
588	108071	@business Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
589	109440	So apparently Norway and Denmark  have suspended use of the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine the same Vaccine the Kenyan govt wants us to believe is the best
590	110284	*Just learnt smth that blew my mind:*To get a visa for China, a person has to be inoculated a Chinese vaccine ONLY. This totally defies LOGIC! Humanity is engaged in a war against a virus, not among the nations. #China #COVID19 #India
591	111288	@toryboypierce Arbeidt macht frei.The unjabbed are the untermenschen .Nobody who is double jabbed has died of COVID-19 .Everyone who has COVID-19 is unvaccinated .Get rid of these evil bastards who won’t take the jab then we can all live in peace

593	107751	And now they are trying to mandate the vaccine when the only thing is does is reduce the symptoms. Sorry but not sorry I will not ever get the COVID-19 vaccine
594	107737	Or worse.  Kills people or otherwise causes harm.  This is what proper official testing is for.But my biggest fear is Trump will suddenly declare there is a vaccine and give everyone a flu shot or something then just declare it's all over.
595	107954	We need a vaccine that stops the spread. We may never get that. My question is:Does COVID19 have the ability to mutate during the time a vaccinated person is infected?#WearAMask
596	112164	@Mememamamimi @RCObsGyn @MidwivesRCM Why would this vaccine be any different from other flu vaccines? The annual flu vaccine is offered to primary school kids as a nasal spray. I know this new one for Covid-19 isn't suitable for children, but if I was still of child- bearing age , I would still opt in.
597	202439	Fully vaccinated!Got our second dose of Covid-19 vaccine today at Balak Ram Hospital.#GetVaccinatedNow #COVISHIELD https://t.co/FerjUGADr5
598	201912	@DodgerScot YES, Absolutely! Before the vaccine I got COVID-19 &amp; I got pretty ill, but thank goodness I didn't end up having 2 be hospitalized. I loss family &amp; friends 2 COVID-19, including my Mom, even though we did everything 2 keep my Mom safe &amp; in quarantine. 😢 #BSMARTGETTHESHOT 💉💯👍
599	109271	We’ll see how it goes. In the meantime, don’t forget that #COVID19 is transmitted by 5G and @BillGates is funding the #vaccine to #microchip us all.
600	108492	Unlikely to be as we hope for. #mrna #moderna #COVID19  we need vaccine for those with weak immune system .Those with strong immunity will defeat the virus regardless.For those with declined immunity, they need larger dose to have an effective response .. how safe is the dose ?
601	112518	Thank goodness I got my #COVID19 vaccine today. @POTUS will be there tomorrow and traffic is going to be insane, as if it isn’t messed up already.
602	107986	@lilithsubmerged @JustTheObvious1 @vikingjedi23 @__Lynnette___ @nypost And if he accidentally spreads it to a cancer patient or someone with an organ transplant, that would be unacceptable.Hospitals and healthcare providers should mandate vaccines. Period.Get vaccinated or get infected. Virus has an R0 of 6.
603	108158	This is EVERYTHING why I’m against this vaccine because they’re trying so damn hard to make you sheep get it wake up something is wrong
604	110616	@theskindoctor13 @prajwalkaushik1 Bhai u forget the @ArvindKejriwal he will say that We found the coronavirus Vaccine and It will be printed on tractor saloon autorickshaw bus taxi written on road and also whole delhi peoples should hang a placard on their back in which huge kejriwal face will b there his Teeth

606	111527	It’s crazy cuz nightclubs in atlanta are open. Seeing my friends’ instagrams you would think they got a cure or a vaccine for COVID down there before up. Do something. Close compound and all them other clubs. @KeishaBottoms
607	111690	Covid 19 is not going away until there is a vaccine. Because people are stupid and greedy. Hopefully there will still be people alive then.
608	112660	Just got my booster yesterday. Go ahead and get yours ASAP if you’re in one of the advised groups, or go ahead and start getting vaccinated if you haven’t yet! This has all been going on for so long with too much suffering. We can beat this if we do our part and get others to.
609	111645	@sailorrooscout Hi Chise 🙃 Do you have any info on whether people’s immune systems get extra immunity if they’ve had 2 x vaccine doses plus a booster, and they are then exposed to coronavirus, but don’t have a breakthrough infection?
610	112226	Spending time with the family and my grandpa asks me to explain why they haven’t found a vaccine for COVID-19 yet. I start explaining how a virus works and then mention DNA.....this dude looks me dead in the eye and says “I don’t believe in that shit, DNA isn’t real”
611	108132	So no vaccine shot and he caught Covid so dam smart Knowing here in Las Vegas we are getting hit with 2 additional variants running around like it’s cool but I guess he thought not me I hope his lungs will be ok- what a smart one 🤔
612	110567	@mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump He thinks he is above science....   anyway i never took the flu vaccine and i will hever take the Covid-19 vaccine either....  let the Trumptards take it since they blindly believe in him 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
613	108376	Grandparents have just had the #covid19 vaccine and feeling great! 🥰 They would tell anyone who gets the call to have one to take up the offer and get vaccinated!! 🙌🏻👊🏻 #COVIDVaccination
614	108434	What a Hell is running..?So now it's clear why PM, HM and CMs and MPs etc.. are avoiding to take vaccine..!!!!!Medical Staff is On Risk.!
615	108542	Literally no one who got the vaccine last week — if they were even able to get it that quickly! Bc parents work and stuff! — is anywhere near fully immunized. They all still need a second shot! This is bad framing.
616	108563	@CNN in Russia they are planning to have an untested covid19 vaccine by october. Trump will want the US to “buy” said vaccine and when everyone decries foul play cuz it is, then he will try to further divide.#SoSAmerica
617	111632	Remember when the headlines all of sudden switched to “African Americans are being effected by coronavirus the worst.Now the headlines are “Coronavirus vaccine will be made available to African American communities first”🤨 I know a set up when I see one. Don’t fall for it
618	109360	I think all work places should give their employees an incentive for getting their #COVID19 #vaccine Depends on where you work. Just show the card you receive after getting vaccinated. It's up to the employer to choose what you get.  #RETWEET #GetVaccinatedToday
619	110097	The #coronavirus won’t just “go away” like @realDonaldTrump says. It’s here and it will stick around just like the variations of the #flu. It’s one thing to get a #vaccine made but, #vaccines only work best when they are received/given. #accessibility #VaccinesWork
620	111226	Nadhim, I think you’re great - but I don’t think this push is helping anyone - if people don’t know how to get a vaccine by now, then they’re not interested in getting one
621	112323	A lot of people in my life who've said they're concerned about poor people exploiting government resources don't seem to be too concerned about lying to the government so they can get their coronavirus vaccine before cancer patients
622	112406	The leisure sector, gyms, pools, etc, has warned it will still struggle because of the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic.They don’t want us to be healthy. Not with a vaccine on the horizon #Dystopia #health #leisure #fitness #NoVaccine #novaccines #KBF #freedom
623	111532	"Why is there even an international ""line-up"" for a #COVID19 vaccine? Shouldnt each country be generating the vaccine themselves? Or is one country really gonna hold the world hostage?"

628	112539	Just fell in love with the woman who checked me in for my vaccine. And ya know what, I'm positive she fell in love with me too. I didn't get her name. Is this the COVID-19 pandemic love story we've all been waiting for? Or did some HBO Max screenwriter do this already?
629	111016	Reoccurrence of coronavirus is very rare...Once you get the coronavirus you wouldn't get it twice...like a herd immunity or a virtual vaccine... Instead of abusing NTA, we should thank them for the vaccine and for the population control bill..#JEENEET #JEEMain #NEET2020
630	201861	"On ""Inject Disinfectant"" anniversary day, I am comfortable with the fact that I decided to go the route of waiting for the actual vaccine, as opposed to you know, injecting poison into my veins directly. It's debatable I guess, but I feel like I made the correct choice here."
631	107865	@senatemajldr why ??? You should not get it until the last American who wants the vaccine gets the vaccine. You are shameless and will be judged one day for everyone you have been complicit in killing &amp; sending to the streets. Disgusting.
632	111221	@62Seabee I have no interest in the vaccine, I had coronavirus I'll depend on my immune system. They don't know how long the vaccine is good for. They have said you can still get and pass coronavirus. Still have to social distance and where a mask. I see no purpose in getting vaccine
633	202381	My 87 yr old neighbor took the jab &amp; broke out w/SHINGLES all over her face, mouth n down her throat. Dr said was a reaction to the vaccine! Other elderly are getting sick from the jab! As for me n my house, my dog &amp; I will TRUST in GOD who created me! #MyBodyMyChoice
634	112315	@shakeyjs (Not liking it really!) Sorry you’re having to deal with Covid19 in this way. Hope all get well soon! Kids need the vaccine in most cases - with appropriate diligence!

645	111804	@ignorantdoteth If you actually did some research, they’ve been working on the coronavirus vaccines for many years. Please stop with the blatant ignorance
646	108311	In order to make a vaccine there must be NO, mutations, coronavirus has SIX (6) mutations.  I’m not anti-vaccine but knowing corona has SIX mutations, NO way people should take it.
647	112841	Australians will be among the first in the world to receive a #COVID19 vaccine, if it proves successful,The vaccine will be produced in Australia and every Australian will get a free coronavirus vaccine dose. #covid19australia #covid19au #covidvaccine #coronavirusaustralia

649	112067	@TrumpWarRoom @TrueAmericans4U Just think about what the Democrats are doing they’re actually hoping people keep dying of the coronavirus before the election. You don’t hear them hoping and wishing the vaccine comes out.
650	112031	I actually was wondering why some Mullah has not raised the halal flag yet, and barred Muslims from taking a haraam vaccine. 😃Will be interesting to see how many Muslims refuse to take the vaccine, and risk getting Covid.
651	112012	This is VERY important. I, too, wondered how a vaccine could be as safe, in 10mths, as 10yrs. My (amateur) research provided some obvious answers that, as an amateur, I had not even considered. 10mths IS akin to 10yrs, due to FOCUSED process administration and funds availability.
652	110833	A message to vaccine fascists. If your vaccines work then what's the issue and if they don't work how is giving it to me gonna make it work better?This is about authoritarianism and the lemming mentality of simple minds like yours.#cdnpoli #Elxn44 #elexn44
653	111839	Smallpox started circulating in the 3rd century BCE. Edward Jenner developed the first smallpox vaccine (the first *ever* vaccine) in 1796. It took until 1980 to eradicate smallpox. We may never eradicate covid, but if we do, it will *certainly* not be in any of our lifetimes.

658	112157	Getting really sick of explaining a basic fact: vaccines do not prevent mutations. In fact, they increase mutations. This is totally uncontroversial. Next, there is no way to stop mutation of the COVID-19 virus. None. Please stop the nonsense.
659	108115	Calling all the folks who have been following the COVID-19 crisis in CA prisons (especially @SharonDolovich @aaronlittman @WDavidBall @mjschlanger): Why do you think we're seeing judicially imposed vaccine mandates in NY and OR but not in CA?

668	109873	"You REALLY want to see a generational change, wait til you get the ""shot"" Doctor Gates has cooked up for you. There was never an RNA vaccine, NO vaccine manufacturer has ever safety-tested the indredients (a real witch's brew), no animal or human studies for efficacy or safety!"
669	109576	@northumbrian_ @Matt_W1985 @berniespofforth @AwayFromTheKeys @JamesMelville As we track the daily progress of the COVID-19 vaccine across all countries, it's pretty likely Americans will get access to the vaccine. The more interesting ques. remains just how effctv it will be.
670	109301	“good option for people who are immune compromised or haven't mounted an adequate immune response through the vaccine.”$REGN
671	202235	More than 200 million people in the US have received at least one dose of a #COVID19 vaccine. It’s not too late to make an appointment and get vaccinated today!
672	112750	@whippletom Ok @whippletom - but will the vaccine still work with high efficacy against “the perfect human coronavirus”?! Would be great if you could retrieve that tidbit of info from behind the Times paywall for us
673	108531	Yet they also say the vaccine isn’t very effective against the new variant 🤔 blind leading the blind! Government is clueless!!!
674	111269	Saying things like this is going to lead to revolt. And as someone who has tried to remain extremely balanced and grounded throughout the entire pandemic if ANY measures remain after majority take vaccine I will be one of the first.They're either dumb or evil.
675	110168	Why is it literally impossible for me to find a place to get a Covid-19 vaccine??? I’m in Michigan, and every pharmacy I check won’t schedule me an appointment because they’re supposedly so incredibly booked up!!!
676	111071	Of course you dont have to get the vaccine, as someone who wants the pandemic to end, I am going to do so in order to help. Don’t say you want covid to end but won’t take the vaccine cause you use facebook as a reference.
677	202367	@amishclone @benjimast I am scheduled for my 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Friday. After 1st dose my only side effect was a sore arm. Think the vaccine is a very important tool in the COVID-19 fight.
678	201879	Walk in vaccine slots at @TeamQEH today and tomorrow. Had yours yet? If not then pop in and get the jab and the protection it offers 👍
679	110188	@MayorOfTwitr @TeaPainUSA Not only is the covid-19 virus running wild but so is the stupid virus &amp; unfortunately the stupid will never have a vaccine.
680	108977	@saywow22 @Glamma726 @SeunOwonikoko @glamelegance @realDonaldTrump You will be forced to take a vaccine with Covid19 and a microchip very soon.  Fauci &amp; Gates are working on it right now.  Your every move will be tracked.  Trump it trying to stop this but you will be first in line it appears.
681	202170	Going for my second #COVID19 jab today. I couldn’t be more excited, because I want to protect myself and people around me #VaccinateToSaveSouthAfrica #GetVaxxedRightNow #VAXXED
682	202225	Feels so good to get my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. I feel so much more at ease for myself and my family. I can’t wait until this is available for anyone that wants it! I can finally see some light at the end of the tunnel 🙏🏽
683	111393	@TheDamaniFelder Good idea BUT if they will get just the REGULAR flu vaccine....and pretend to have taken the Covid19 vaccine?
684	109478	@BrianReymann @NolteNC I see so doesn’t this apply to just about any coronavirus which we’ve known about since at least the 60’s? if vaccines/antibodies don’t protect you then we’re to be locked down and worship your mask god forever?Why not before?Absolutely bonkers, not logical.
685	111535	@johnjamesrando @ralph44668932 @shellity I haven’t met any one who is anti coronavirus vax and just that one. They’re either true antivaxxers and are against all of them or they’re conspiracy theorists who think alien pedophiles are going to track them with the vaccine.
686	111453	Who the hell is going to pay for AE’s if the parents’ don’t consent? My kid certainly doesn’t have enough to pay for the bills from his myocarditis hospitalization and follow ups. These vaccines are immune from any financial liability. I’m genuinely curious how this would work.
687	202150	my coworkers and I are spacing out our second covid-19 vaccines so we don’t all end up missing work the same day if we have bad side effects 🤪half our coworkers said it was the same as the first, the other half said it was a day of fatigue, fever, aches, chills, etc.
688	111204	@JimJwbubba @TarheelKrystle The answer to your question is no, there has never been a vaccine for any coronavirus produced.  I’m sure as hell not taking the beta  Version 0.01

Never in my life have I had the flu never in my life have I had a flu vaccine. I will get the coronavirus vaccine b4 end of yr.
691	109884	When you get Covid will you take bed in the ICU or will you be that strong anti mask anti vaccine person and tough it out at home I truly hope so Ignorance is bliss
692	107813	Thalidomide is used today in the treatment of multiple myeloma, and it is very effective in the majority of cases. My mother took it for 10 months. It's not a vaccine, and there is no connection or comparison to any new COVID19 vaccine, unless you're a scaremongering COVIDIOT.

695	107962	Dear #Antivax of the world, how do you like the demo version of a vaccine free world? Don't you plan any infection parties? #covid19 #corona #virus
696	112560	Have you asked the Fed Government what they are doing to rectify their bungled vaccine rollout, or why they haven’t opened up purpose built quarantine facilities? I’m just going to assume the answer to these questions is no, because you are not a fan of the truth/facts.
697	107707	@NoobRobot2 @AP No it’s not! It’s a vaccine you have to get each year weather you’ve had COVID-19 or not! Flu shot isn’t a cure it’s a vaccine
698	110327	@donach69 @FrankPlutonium @paulmasonnews They cannot avoid the inevitable. Coronavirus is now an endemic virus. Even when there is a vaccine people will die from it. New Zealand is just delaying the inevitable.
699	112313	Maybe they should have just let COVID-19 run through the world one time??? I mean what kind of logic is that? Just don’t get the vaccine, nobody is forcing anyone to get it, including you.. Like When are these hoe ass bitches gonna shut the fuck up? They make 0 sense…
700	109562	@tvcoh4 @JoeBiden Coronavirus is like the flu.  It mutates and the vaccines are already ineffective and virus has run its course by the time vaccines are made.  Which is why we have 1,000 flu vaccines and influenza is still here to stay.
701	109282	there is not vaccine for sars,,,mers,,,ebola...so what makes you to believe there will be a vaccine for covid19?
702	110783	Just got my first COVID-19 vaccine shot at Walmart! And I even got a Mountain Dew Baja Blast, straight from Taco Bell! Am I awesome, or what? My second COVID-19 vaccine is scheduled for May 22nd, Pac-Man's 41st anniversary! Coincidence, perhaps? I think not!
703	109915	I feel like the COVID-19 vaccine is going to be how the Zombie Apocalypse begins.But, let the record show, I say this for every vaccine created recently 🤣🤣🤣
704	112850	"@suzost Good grief - for once I agree with Farrakan!Coronavirus vaccines are *all* potentially deadly due to the known fatal twist of ""immune enhancement"" - which has PLAGUED prior vaccines in the category.The idea of giving ANY corona vaccine first to blacks is ""you first"" at BEST!"
705	112913	@illumiwookie @CovfefeKatie Coronavirus isn't ebola. Even 200,000 deaths is low. Expecting to shut everything down until it magically goes away or a vaccine is developed is unrealistic, child-like thinking. This is a deliberate attempt by liberals to destroy America and blame it on Trump so he don't win.

707	109519	So many parents like myself have waited for this news: the CDC is officially recommending the Pfizer vaccine to children ages 5-11. Widespread vaccines are the only way we’ll beat this pandemic, and I encourage all parents to get their kids vaccinated as soon as they can.
708	112758	Ffs fed up with this anti-intellectualism. Please get the vaccine. I get my second dose tomorrow, and I can’t wait.
709	108749	I'm surprised they are not using puppies and kittens to make this vaccine or better yet bats they should be using bats as the Covid-19 came from bats so let's use bats to create a Vaccine to combat Bats if that even makes sense just like their vaccine makes no sense
710	108209	It it's only 12%, why are there still mandates from Trudy? Why the hell is the tantrum-thrower-in-blackface getting in the way of a nation getting back to normal?If vaccine rates are anywhere near what the propaganda says, why are they still even bothering to advertise them?
711	112281	Wait until they start dying ( which they will)....do people still not think this is all about control.Keep jabbing your child or he can’t go to school...he can’t do anything...This is coming our way unless mandates/ passports  are STOPPED NOW
712	112640	I have taken the flu vaccine &amp; still got the flu. Why? There are different strains, they guess which strains will be available &amp; create vaccines for those. The strain you get may not be in the vaccine. A Covid-19 vaccine may not protect you. Practice wearing your mask now.
713	111650	Gouvernement Logic: thank the vaccine to protect you from the coronavirus but still can get the coronavirus and still transmit it👀🤔😐..
714	110044	“My mom says that me getting the vaccine that I got literally saved my life,” she said. “We wouldn’t have known otherwise when I might have detected the cancer that my immune system had just picked up on.”
715	108674	@BraincoralMusic Yes which is why they “extended” the coronavirus act 2020 for another 6 months,because if that ends,so does the emergency powers meaning no more vaccines.I just didn’t know if something had been announced about over 65s like they have for under 30s
716	107684	Garbage take right here. Get the vaccine. The only way we get back to anything even remotely close to a normal life is if we all get vaccinated. That’s it. That’s the only way. Tired of wearing a mask? Want to travel? Want to hug your friends? Vaccine. It’s the only way.

724	112695	@Fridayg29026494 @susan_tighe @EduardVimard @SoniaPoulton Do you know how vaccines work? The covid-19 vaccine absolutely produces antibodies for the variants it’s designed against. Like a normal vaccine! It’s exactly like the yearly flu vaccine. The term disease is used quite loosely nowadays. Illness, virus, condition.
725	108771	So we know a second wave is coming in the Fall/Winter, why are these cities opening up so fast? I’m so confused, not a vaccine in sight. Mind you, people are still dying from COVID-19 as you read this tweet. What is going on?!
726	110483	@NewDay Why cry wolf 😂 if people are crying after a family member dies because they didn’t get the Covid-19 Shot, so what they made their own bed 😂 I won’t get a booster unless I get paid to get it 💵

735	109799	I’m isolating again after testing positive for Covid19 for a second time.. I was really poorly first time .. not too bad as of yet but early days and  I’ve had my vaccine 2wks ago!  Do not take this virus lightly!!  Please just be careful peeps ❤️xx

739	108256	@MaMoMVPY Oh dear , you don’t get it , the vaccine will mean those vaccinated will get serious illnesses from lesser Coronavirus’s like the common cold (strains as we are being fed) hospitalisations will increase
740	111602	Arabs are so fucking racist and stupid they acted like coronavirus wasnt their fault ok bitch race for the vaccine then
741	107903	These covid19 vaccines are just like the flu shots. You'll still get sick, mostly moderately. Some, however, will get severe disease, need hospitalisation or even worse, may die. We have no data about how many will get severe enough to be hospitalised or how many will die...

749	110123	@albertanbeech They believe this government, if Trump had won, more people would be against mandating the vaccine.

750	108306	@IiiLacour @_bethani @Mrknowitalll_ @BarkyBoogz Exactly. We never needed a vaccine before bc coronavirus was just mild colds so they never researched to make a vaccine until sars in 02 bc SARS was different and they needed to study it and create a vaccine just like now
751	110267	Ayan, ha. If any of these vaccine brands are offered to you, you should please get them already. Wala nang arte-arte pa.
752	109388	@senpaicoffee To further break it down for you since you are slow, once a variant comes out, we will have to adjust the current vaccine to address it. Its called Covid-19 because there were 18 previously known versions of the virus prior to the pandemic just not as deadly or contagious.
753	109132	Lmao this is the footage my local news used to show Seattle vaccine testing for Chinese virus. Is any of this real?
754	111267	I have four people who live in my house who are over 60 I'm a diabetic and to take the vaccine would we have to all take it at the same time is there a chance that if only one takes it that they could transfer the coronavirus to the others who didn't take the vaccine
755	110266	If after having the vaccine you can still carry and pass the virus on what is the point of the healthy and low risk having it ??

761	107675	This is classic Shingles, which is brought on by a stress to the immune system like a vaccine (any vaccine) and is only activated if you have had chickenpox which is a form of herpes. And if you already carry an HSV, this is a normal response. Stop fear mongering!!!!

766	112112	@rose_2222223 @SkyNews Flu is not so highly transmissible and you're only contagious when you know you've got it. There's an established vaccine, it disappears in spring and requires less hospitalisation. Healthy people still get ill with Covid-19 and spread it, sometimes asymptomatically.

770	108748	@JL4486 @BMoreBirdsNest valid to wonder, if a Coronavirus can be this troublesome, why wasn't there a general vaccine developed for it before?  We know this isn't a new family of viruses...only real difference with this one seems to be a longer carrier period.They've been studying these, why no vax?
771	111159	We will never see it because it doesn't exist. Rick is right...he keeps promising it like it will miraculously appear, just like the Coronavirus vaccine he promised.  Even if he did rush something through, I AM NOT TAKING IT! I will stay in my house until Joe get into office.

I'm sceptical about a vaccination being isolated, discovered, tested and produced in a matter of months.I am not having the Covid-19 vaccine.I don't care if someone is vaccinated. I do care if I loss my job because I don't.
792	109897	@RN_Destiny Now they are saying that the vaccines may wane after 7 months. If vaccinated you can still can get COVID-19 and you can still pass it on. So what is the point of the vaccine? Don't think many know what's going on and the vaccine is a trial drug.
793	110541	The flu shot can make you feel unwell... honestly they should just delete this because it’s going to create more conspiracy around the vaccine
794	107679	@cnbcevents @megtirrell @NIH @NIAIDNews Meg! You are doing an awesome job reporting on the coronavirus and all the vaccines and medicines! Keep up the good work!
795	108154	If this is true, then why even have a Phase 3 trial if the vaccine is being approved before all trials are complete? 🤔🤔
796	111116	AstraZeneca was always a tier two vaccine. The “get any vaccine” advice seems very flawed in hindsight. There’s a reason the Americans never approved it.
797	109620	@JoeBiden Masks? I’m not seeing coronavirus in my orbit. We are not admitting few if at all   In my orbit. And, we are not seeing any Coronavirus patients die in my orbit. Thanks to @realDonaldTrump we have tests, meds, ventilators, and now, vaccines. You have zero clue.
798	109568	Cuba made their own vaccine AND everyone is going to get vaccinated all while under blockade by the USA. Meanwhile the pandemic is getting worse in America
799	109532	@Jessica28000244 @redpop86 @science_cited Your opinion matters very much. Please keep sharing!! :)Our opinion, no coronavirus vaccine has ever been deemed safe. Don't think this will be any different. Faster they go, more unsafe it is, more mistakes made. No mandates = No concern
800	202224	I swear I feel like my arm is slowly turning to a painful brick after taking the COVID-19 Vaccine, seriously my arm is so sore😖😖😖
801	110228	Just like the #PPEshortage when a vaccine becomes available, there will be a shortage, we won't get any or we'll buy useless vaccines. Another #ToryCovidCriminalMismanagement in the making.
802	109991	@PMOIndia It is very difficult to encourage the people's to take the Covid-19 vaccine because of different rumours, for this my suggestion to GOI Please launch the INSURANCE POLICY for post vaccination period which will be covered disabilities and mortality because of any reason.
803	110875	@RexChapman Then he went on to compare the research being done for a vaccine to the coronavirus to the Manhattan Project in which the research ended with the death of a projected 225,000 people and nuclear warfare is still something we are worried with to this day. Not a good comparison.
804	111358	Hello, just want to say na the vaccine we have now for COVID-19 is for EMERGENCY USE ONLY. DONT GET ME START WITH UNG MGA ANAK NYO NA PA-VACCINE-AN COZ BITCH THOSE VACCINES ARE DEVELOPED AND FDA-APPROVED ALREADY.
805	109677	Do you have ANY idea how stupid you sound? Get an FDA approved vaccine (Regenerson NOT FDA approved) and you don’t get Covid19 or you get such mild symptoms you DON’T have to go to the hospital!!  Stupidity will kill you!
806	109951	@isonwilm @AaronCanen @ostrachan @Antithesis_Pod Covid-19 has statistically been much worse than the common flu on a large-scale. The goal is to minimize the amount of deaths while we reach herd immunity. I agree, people should choose for themselves if they get the vaccine or not but there is no doubt that they have so-far...
807	201842	@JulesB_07 So very sorry to hear this Jules. In my opinion, all Police Officers, should have had a Covid-19 Jab along with NHS Staff. All frontline Workers.😢🙏
808	109083	@b51507829 I don't even understand her point? Like does she not understand that coronavirus is what causes the common cold, and SARS-CoV-2 is a deadly variant of the coronavirus? RNA vaccine research has been happening for nearly 2 decades. I don't...what?
809	111790	@BostonGlobe Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.

812	109753	I gotta share this again. Too important. Do not get this vaccine and ESPECIALLY don’t let your children get this vaccine!!!
813	110488	@SAMiR_5777 @kulanicool People like you are useless not vaccineIf you don't want to take Indian vaccine then don't take ,India is not forcing you, ok inject covid-19 then,or your Chinese vaccine equal to water🖕
814	109199	Please someone share this with @realDonaldTrump there is no quick solution to this virus but a #vaccine#coronavirus #COVID19
815	111138	Is there any sane person in this world who would resist to take a covid-19 vaccine ?If somebody resists, we don't want such creatures
816	111386	What if the vaccine fails and y’all gonna force us to take it?? I’m getting an attorney and a bail for you delusional bitches
817	109197	@livemint Coronavirus has to get their right to complain coz vaccine and lockdown weakens his business..
818	109171	The way to go is e-learning and contact tracing solutions during this covid-19 vaccine free period. It saves direct Dr contact with clients and it keeps educating possible. We have these solutions in case you share my view.
819	109284	Heads up - the vaccine helps to reduce / eliminate the symptoms of the #coronavirus -they don't know yet if the vaccine actually stops the virus from SPREADING. Plus - you need TWO DOSES. So until people QUIT DROPPING DEAD -we still need to wear a mask -practice social distancing
820	201924	First #COVID19 jab done. Wow! That sore arm kicks in fast! 😬Superb level of care and welcoming staff from @nhscroydon_ My nurse, Karen, was wonderful - so helpful 💙#NHSheroes
821	202248	The weather is miserable, lockdown is still boring, but today is a better day than most - my mum has had her first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.
822	110720	If Americans were a truly adaptive and compassionate people, we would all just shave our heads and not give a shit what our roots looked like until a vaccine was developed.But, we're only two months into this thing and already threatening Civil War.#COVID19 #MichiganProtests
823	109399	@ThePubliusUSA @AdamParkhomenko There isn't and never has been a vaccine for a coronavirus, not foing to happen with this one either. Been what 18 years since SARS? Where is that vaccine, how about MERS?
824	112900	@TomGPritchard @BigManPauly @RexChapman So it’s ‘only’ 2-3 times as deadly as the flu but then add in the fact that we don’t yet have a vaccine for coronavirus and suddenly it’s about 10 times more deadly. AND if the vaccine is as effective as the flu vaccine it will still be 2-3 times as deadly.
825	109557	"This is what what you get when you search on the Mass. vaccine site  today and filter for  Only Sites With Known Availability:""No locations match this criteria."""
826	112692	Apparently scientists have never produced a single approved vaccine or anti-viral drug for ANY coronavirus. Betting the well-being of an entire country on the assumption there will be an effective virus is poor reasoning.
827	110885	And this is EXACTLY why @CalforNC told @SenThomTillis last night that he’d be “hesitant” to take a vaccine. There is no conceivable reality on planet earth in which a safe and effective vaccine can be studied, approved, manufactured, and distributed within weeks.
828	202020	Moderna, Vaccine, COVID-19 Vaccine, Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine - Chattanooga, Tennessee - Moderna Vaccine.  I will receive my 2nd dose on 1/28/21 at 3pm.  No side effects.  Arm mildly sore for 2... SafelyHQ https://t.co/LWfpaWHxCF https://t.co/XL6oaCpQCp
829	111753	The only acceptable reason to not get the vaccine is if you would physically die from getting it. Nothing else
830	110582	@MDWaters1975 @Annakhait 1.  Took Coronavirus seriously and prioritized vaccine.2. Infrastructure, our roads are crumbling and need repair.
831	111741	“The rules for Covid-19 vaccines are clear: Vaccine providers are not allowed to bill patients, period,” Larry Levitt, executive vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. “Everyone can get a vaccine for free, whether they’re insured or not.”
832	201951	@MKBHD @MKBHD ; I've been testing the vaccine for the last 2 years, and here's my review and final impressions.And thanks to @dbrand for sponsoring the video. Get your COVID-19 vaccine skin in the link below.
833	111559	If you took the vaccine, the vaccine works, and you go into the restaurant,you go into the bar,you go to the store,you go to the sporting event,and you go in there and someone else didn’t take the vaccine,why do you care?
834	108681	After the hype about Moderna’s mRNA coronavirus vaccine, I wrote about why Oxford’s vaccine, which instead uses an adenoviral vector, may be safer. Now AstraZeneca got $1 billion from the US to develop the vaccine with Oxford. Here’s the science of it all:
835	109051	So the same people who called this virus a liberal hoax and refused to wear masks will be the first ones to get the vaccine? I just want to make sure I have this right... Appalling.
836	107746	Yesterday, the University of Windsor announced mandatory vaccines for all students &amp; staff. Wondering why my Alma mater, @McMasterU hasn't done so. When did we start coming last, Mac? 😟
837	109435	If an mRNA vaccine was approved for coronavirus, it would be the first of its type. ‘It's a very unique way of making a vaccine and, so far, no (such) vaccine has been licenced for infectious disease,’ said Prof. Bekeredjian-Ding.
838	109980	Having worked in a vaccine lab before I hope people realize just how /hard/ and costly it is to even begin to test and research different hypothesizes.Microbial labs take time. From inoculating, to growing, to producing- thats days maybe a week depending on wht you're working on
839	108388	@LanaKay11 @SpringSteps @HerStr8RightTho @adrienne_haddad I took the vaccine so I would be protected against COVID19. Just like I get flu shots and tetanus boosters. You don’t want the vaccine? Fine. I got it so I could hang out in bars or fly with unvaxxed people. You made your choice to NOT get vaxxed. Don’t belittle me for my choice.
840	110361	@washingtonpost #Covid19 It's been here for years. Everyone has had it or is getting it. It's that we are testing for it now. We didn't before. The #Covidvaccine has also been in production and administered to livestock for years. Just research it then you will know.. #COVID19 IS NOT THE KILLER.
841	112283	Questions for #COVID19 #VaccineMandates 1. How does me getting vaccinate help?2. If COVID is so bad, why not just let me die like an ignorant idiot?3. How can the FDA possibly have long term data on a vaccine that’s only existed for 8 months?Sincerely,Had Covid, still here
842	112443	We don't know the severity of the coronavirus. Downplaying it is  detrimental to planning for the worse, and hoping for the best. Most worrisome of all is that there is no vaccine. It could take up to a year to get one. First, they need to  identify this particular virus.  Scary.
843	202382	Delighted to announce that I am being put on the waiting list to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. All that needs to happen now is for me to be referred for a Covid-19 vaccine. But, this is a first step and an important step in my journey to receiving the Covid-19 vaccine.
844	112564	Anyone who is an #AntiMasker is probably also an #AntiVaxxerBut if they're not an #AntiVaxxer, they should go to the back of the line for a #Covid19 vaccine shotIncluding #trump and all #GOP politicians

Negative COVID19 PCR test results back today though wasn’t really expecting otherwise, just my body’s response to the vaccine (same essentially as to second jab).
846	107940	But it is going to take them at least a year to get the vaccine to everyone? So would they start off in India
847	110335	Interesting.🤔 So Countries pay millions or billions for companies to make the Coronavirus vaccine in turn they charge for releasing it. Someone is making a huge profit here.
848	202036	I read online that you need to wait just for 2 weeks after getting Covid19 symptoms to get the vaccine , I had the symptoms but my report was negative and it's been 3 weeks now so I am gonna try and book a slot now.
849	108888	@GMB So @MattHancock @DHSCgovuk is it one jab or two? Do the poor get one jab and @Conservatives and their cronies get two?This mixed messaging and cronyism doesn't help the fight against #coronavirus or support the idea we're in it together!#VaccineStrategy
850	202275	#Coronavirus #COVID19 #USA#VaccinesYesss!I got my second dose of a vaccine against COVID-19. #Vaccinated We are moving closer to normalcy one person at a time.23.9% fully vaccinated in the US.41.7% at least 1 dose.We will defeat COVID-19.#GetVaccinated 1/2 https://t.co/KNpdGoWqUp
851	109420	@gmeloqu718 @MagicOhio @SiouxHcky1 @JeffIrish7 @WillFOIA @carlquintanilla Let me guess - you don't know there's never been a vaccine for a coronavirus and COVID-19 is never going away? So it's just hide in your house forever,  is it?
852	202415	Received my second dose of COVID-19 vaccine today. I have permission to share this picture of my awesome nurse colleague who helped me today.  🎉😊 Now off to home visits! Shout out to the fantastic KPSB Home Care Team that is the wind beneath my wings!!!🥰 #HomeCareRocks https://t.co/Bn1SryNNju
853	110295	@j_mcelroy And if the test shows positive then all you can do is self-isolate. There is NO vaccine to cure you.So , if you believe you have covid19, just do the right thing and self-isolate immediately. There is NO vaccine to cure you.The fix is the same either way.
854	110588	Dear Boris, nice way to put it, you make it sound looks like Britain has developed the Vaccine, its German from Biontech, Scientists are German of Turkish Origin. Produced in BelgiumIn any event I must congratulate you, a good old Eaton boy manages to fool others

857	111594	@jassij1984 As an aside, I have informed all people in my circle and close work colleagues that I am unvaccinated now (no issues except one - who I dont care about). I am not anti vax, just booked my flu jab, I am just not comfortable with any covid19 jab until I see some long term data
858	112535	@NikkiHaley would like us to believe that #capitalism is going discover the #COVID19 vaccineWhat she leaves out, as so many GOPers and rugged capitalists do, is that billions of #taxpayer  money is going into the initial research to jumpstart the researchIt's an ensemble act
859	109848	@davidaxelrod I can’t judge anyone’s need to ignore scientific facts during a Global pandemic- but- if it doesn’t work out for you, I’m just one step closer to getting the coronavirus 19 vaccine once its developed.#TrumpHasNoPlan
860	111506	"Today I learned why Bill Gates created the virus? He wants to ""vaccinate"" everybody and put a tracking chip in their body because Microsoft phones failed and they dont have a way to track us like Google and Apple do. We must stop this!!!#COVID19 #vaccines"
861	111608	@HillaryClinton @CAPAction I am scheduled to get my first dose of the coronavirus vaccine within this month or the next month.
862	112681	Important Question!If as Lying Justin Trudeau claims this whole Virus Caper he has allowed to permeate Canada isn't over till a Vaccine is found (about 18 Months) WHY isn't a Vaccine being pursued to eliminate CoronaVirus Period?
863	108825	@JillHoganRE @CBSNews Why after mo. being told are you &amp; others so ignorant what the vaccines will/will not do? Fully vaccinated people can get covid19!! They can get sick; they can spread it to others. Ea. time COVID infects someone it has potential of mutating beyond what vaccines can handle.
864	108067	We’ve doubled down on vaccines, this keeps happening everywhere. Everyone needs to know after you get the vaccine STAY HOME for two weeks.  The data suggests that you are more vulnerable immediately after the shot for some reason... it does work well eventually.
865	112141	@Ddog10000 Because there is a *bat* coronavirus called BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/ that shares 96% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 across their entire genomes.So its got nothing to do with a vaccine construct. Stop looking for imaginary plots when the obvious is sitting right there
866	109691	Anyone want to bet that this will not last long and come March a 4th vaccine will be needed because “Immunity is Fading”?Pfizer will pay researchers to make something up no doubt and the world will believe them!#CovidVaccine
867	109527	And people do you see what is happening here?What will your life be like if you cannot make purchases? food? water? shelter?How long will you live without taking the vaccine?Do you see a black-market for vaccine certs?Ticketmaster going out of business?Will you comply?

870	112382	I will, and so will my Hispanic husband and children. To the vaccine makers, Please find a winner vaccine ASAP.
871	108889	Of course.While 68 y/o Detroiters who drive an eligible senior get vaccines, my 85 y/o mom in Wayne County still can't get one, guys!
872	110525	I wish Good luck to @POTUS but I want to ask how would you distribute vaccines to other countries especially to dictators who think covid is not real
873	107918	@RenatusVoltaire @AlexBerenson @gummibear737 @EthicalSkeptic Which explains why we never get to “herd immunity” with the yearly influenza vaccines. Those shots, just like the ones for Covid-19 are meant to protect the recipient only.
874	108772	@njalexg @Jamie83851121 @Psygremlin @MeghanMcCain They are allowed to refuse the test and the vaccine.  Thousands of them already have.  It’s not hard to find articles on this.  Please don’t spread your ignorance.  It’s just as contagious, if not more so, than the coronavirus the illegal immigrants are carrying into the US.
875	112410	"Why would the article add ""rare"" to reaction?  How rare is it in comparison to the flu vaccine? Inquiring minds want to know..."
876	108989	It's almost like going out into the world without a vaccine was a terrible, dangerous idea. I hope Kyrie gets well.
877	202074	Thankful to receive my 1st dose of the COVID-19 vaccine today. Bonus was being there at the same time as @Nicole4Raleigh!  Thanks to the team at @WakeMed for a seamless process.  #ralpol https://t.co/WFnFgbB336
878	110332	A good thread summarising the AZ vaccine trial in South Africa. Yes, it is not quite as effective, but it is still good.
879	110180	@Sapere_vivere this is not about all vaccines; this is specifically about the COVID-19 vaccine; even if they give away those patents they still make a lot of money -- when the whole planets has to be vaccinated the wallet is rather big
880	110769	So we accept that COVID-19 is not a one and done and now will invest in better detection, monitoring and presume vaccine distribution.This is what COMPETENT government looks like.
881	111707	Trump supporters won’t get the vaccine but because they don’t know what’s in it but don’t hesitate to house 4 hotdogs for dinner.
882	109303	@ty_pharmer @Alec_Zeck so explain to me why are we signing wavers ? please tell me,show me proof why we need to sign a waver for the covid-19 shot with boosters if they are here to help us? Is it because once you sign that paper no one reliable other then your self ? Does common sense exist anymore ?
883	111821	Maybe @tedlieu will cover everyone’s 9 months of back rent with snarky tweets? Perhaps @RepSwalwell will chip in? After they get the vaccine of course, can’t have these American heros getting sick
884	108018	@CMOH_Alberta You are no doctor. You are sociopath if you think you are not abandoning Albertans with these changes. Our greatest fight against Covid-19 is the vaccine, you say. Yet, you don't give a sh!t about those who are unable to get vaccinated. RESIGN IMMEDIATELY!
885	110438	Not sure why we would give even a single vaccine to anyone not in the US while millions still require one. Of course other countries would want them for their people, but Americans come first. Especially as the government keeps people locked down in various areas.
886	109975	@KidsPlayPhotos @RandyRRQuaid I took the vaccine and it is real it's not Saline I had a very strong immune response my temperature was 102.4 my body swore up and down I had covid again it's a little discomfort but I've had covid-19 I never wanted again
887	109367	They all believe that other countries have been vaccinated.  They believe the vaccine is the only way out. Unfortunately this is just more inaccurate information.#COVID19
888	109183	So much good news in South Dakota re COVID-19 right now. Lots of numbers still high BUT: - Lowest # of active cases in 2 months- Hospitalizations lowest they've been in 2 months- death rate slowing down- Nearly all the Pfizer vaccine we've gotten so far has been administered
889	110158	@KatieDaviscourt @GovInslee You definitely can take vaccines, wear masks,  stay locked up, but don't make others do the same.  Vaccines do not work!Masks do not work!Staying locked up doesn't work! Just get Covid-19. And get over with it or stay locked up forever.  Covid-19 is not going anywhere.
890	110889	@uvmdanz @kylegriffin1 Transverse myelitis is common enough.  It's likely that they needed to confirm a secondary viral infection as its cause - one that wasn't a coronavirus or adenovirus as related to the vaccine. My father had TM. It's devastating, but not a reason to avoid this vaccine.
891	108248	@themadtaer There has never been a vaccine created for a coronavirus of any type.Due to antigenic shift they become useless in a short time.All viruses are not the same
892	108275	@nytimes The process of vaccine research and development is very long, and there are strict international standards. There are two possibilities. The first is to appease the public. The second is that the United States has already obtained the new coronavirus strain for research long ago.
893	108975	This tweet nicely catches the current widespread Covid-19 mood in Germany. ‘The current situation is calling for old jokes made in the GDR. “So you can’t get any vaccine here?”“No, sorry, but you get no vaccine over there. Here, you get no tests.”
894	111551	Reminds Me of d movie #2012 ..D highest bidders n d richest get to live ...Who decide that who would get d #CovidVic vaccine?? D ones with power n d moolah of course ..It sure is gonna get dirty  in d coming months...😑#coronavirus
895	112405	@IvankaTrump 4/ June 16: “I always say, even without it [a vaccine], it goes away.”  June 18: “And it is dying out. The numbers are starting to get very good.” Heh heh heh...250 dead now! More Trump delusions. July 1: “And I think we are going to be very good with the coronavirus.”
896	112665	The CDC is asking those unvaccinated for COVID-19 not to journey far from home this holiday weekend.And they will all honor this request, because  if you're too stupid to take the vaccine, of course you'll religiously observe pandemic travel restrictions.
897	112719	C'mon #Australia - do you really think a 3rd jab, after the first 2 failed to work, will be good for you? #AustraliaHasFallen
898	112631	@ajc Allow me to summarize before reading. There is a shortage so they’re opening up more vaccination centers because there is not enough vaccine to satisfy demand but they need to convince people to get it because too many people want it. Something about Choppin’.
899	109504	This pandemic will not be over until it’s over for everyone, everywhere. I’m calling on @Novavax to pledge their commitment to making sure the COVID-19 vaccine is distributed fairly and equitably around the world. #OneWorldProtected
900	112702	Olympics cancelled to comply with CoViD19 bio-security safety for whole world (air/sea travel+crowds).God has not protected even the most pure+good+religious believers/ humans from SARS so far!Until vaccine given to 80% every country/the world population - nobody is safe.
901	202142	Today is the 1st I will go out. Got the message to do the vaccine today, but need to reschedule in another 3 month since its just a month after detected covid19+.
902	108009	The only way we can get our lives back and be human again is for us all to get the vaccine-Don't listen to rumours listen to the NHS -there's no animal products or alcohol in it, there's no ingredients which suggest it causes infertility, it has been tested as it's a priority.
903	107748	So why I’m in @CVS 15600 old pike rd Maryland and they refuse to do walk-ins for the COVID-19 booster. They stated there is no manager in this store when I recorded the entire event
904	108745	Isn't this... socialized medicine? Govt will pick who gets vaccine soon. But please tell me how trump is somehow stopping communism.
905	111419	@SusanStJames3_ How do you think the globalists got a huge supply of miracle vaccines in short order. They money laundered through Afghanistan. Then they created a coronavirus pandemic. Our benefactors are psychopaths.
906	111274	Great to see that the vaccine is being rolled out! When will school staff get it though? 🤔🤔🤔 #teachertwitter #vaccine #PGCE
907	111492	This! Hourly wage workers cannot take off work (even if legally they are supposed to be allowed to) to go get a vaccine. Too many vaccination sites are only open 9-5 M-F. Why aren’t large employers vaccinating on site? They want to be 100% ‘open’, so why?
908	110538	@JoeBiden you should bow down to President Trimp because Trump said they would come out with the vaccines for COVID-19 this year in 2020. You said they will not come out with it until 2021. You even announced you got the vaccine

916	112453	How the #CovidVaccine is going to work if the #COVID19 is a RNA virus,That means the structure keeps changing over time and gene is mutating .Now they are saying 5/6 types of #COVID are there,then how the vaccine is going to work ???
917	110030	@bantamsdad @LoveMeImBrogan MERS and SARS are also Coronavirus and the research from these has vastly contributed to the speed of development of the covid vaccine, I’d argue that everyone is at risk because everyone can spread it . Just because you may not get ill, your family might
918	107972	@LbudisaLila Australia!? That's cool. I hope you'll get to visit them soon. I believe in vaccines. I'm struggling with letting my autistic son take it. My fear is, he gets sick either with COVID-19 or a reaction to a new (rushed) vaccine, but can't articulate it to us.

948	108830	They are part of problem not the solution. It isn't even a virus, so why would a vaccine work? After 4 or 5 boosters there is no healing or protection from it. However,   with small pox or measles vaccines, you dont get it. People are gullible!

971	109126	@Liv3_Chris @duncansykes @carolecadwalla I accept that but the problem isn’t catching a coronavirus, virtually everyone in the world has had a coronavirus. It’s catching this coronavirus and being hospitalised and then breaching the health system’s capacity. The vaccine hopefully stops that.
972	110623	we dont know how long the vaccine will protect us either. Hell they already saying we need more shots......
973	107757	@TChivese @RangaMberi We need to understand why countries are investing so much on Covid-19 vaccines; to create herd immunity as fast as is possible and stop the virus from mutating into extremely transmissible variants. If goal is herd immunity, then mandatory vaccination of everyone is justifiable!
974	111595	The Coronavirus vaccine will most probably require very low temperature storage. Do we have such storage equipments across governorates in Egypt?
975	108367	The whole house can then stand shoulder to shoulder, with their families, and line up for those vaccines... not saline in a syringe... the same toxic shit they want us to line up for... you first guys. Then I’ll wait 5yrs n see how you’re doing...
976	111362	I shall beg my family for news now. I would wish that my country could get this vaccine easily but we're running low on budget...
977	108624	I just pray we have enough vaccines, don't care what company has made them if they are approved, not only for all of our citizens and others that live in this wonderful country but also for the whole world. Covid-19 is a very deadly disease and we all need a chance to fight it.
978	111237	love all of yalls coronavirus takes. keep em comin. love hearing about lockdowns being good and the vaccines being bad or whatever. good stuff and very informative :)

980	111582	@CPInst @MarkMeadows They first must define whether it is an actual vaccine… which it is not.  #COVID19   Then they must show the proof that they harm the recipient… that spike is deadly.  Next bring out the therapeutics.   Delta is not Wuhan.
981	109653	@briebriejoy @SS6XX The USA essentially subsidizes all medication research is part of the reason for our outrageous costs. I’m not saying it is all warranted, but there’s a reason the first Covid-19 vaccines being rolled out are American.
982	108165	@jkwan_md @Billius27 @Kidsdoc1Rick i'm sorry, didn't i hear expert after expert declare the vaccines would be equally effective for any variants? [we need new flu vaccines every year, right?] not doubting we can get there but a one-time one-vaccine approach probably not the best
983	112729	I think that is the UK govt's. plot.Keep 'fear' going by enforcing the wearing of masks even though the virus has weakened.Then rush out a vaccine - not adequately tested and likely to be inneffective.#NoMask #HydroxycloroquineWorks

989	111937	Mark Meadows is saying that Covid-19 can't be contained. No masks and social distancing needed. Trump is banking on a vaccine that his idiots will not get. Experts say that if only 50% of the population gets the vaccine it will not eradicate Covid-19 and it will be @ for years.
990	108718	Has anyone heard any word yet? Apprantley easterhouse is one of the communities and I’m an unpaid carer for my mum and tried for a vaccine last week and was told there was no spaces and wasn’t on any list coming up?
991	111471	@Morgan_Falk @GYamey Actually - I don’t think you do. The vaccines are based off of the spike protein from this coronavirus. This means that if you had a bad reaction to the vaccine - your reaction to getting covid could be far worse - best

996	109355	@WillowWyse @DavisonPhill @RichardDawkins You want EVERYONE to take a vaccine that doesn't exist. To be against a Bill Gates (not a doctor) covid19 vaccine doesn't make anyone anti vaxx.March, the WHO said no masks for the public. Now they want us to wear masks. Now, take a vaccine. They don't know what they're doing.
997	109467	So...  Herd immunity for Covid-19, is believed?  But vaccines that actually foster herd immunity are bad?  So, herd immunity is junk until something like Covid-19 comes along...  Also, vaccines do not cause autism. Fuck off.  There is no herd immunity to Covid-19. Just stop.

1002	111810	@jimcollinson If the incidence of #Covid19 is 10x lower in the population you would need 10x more recruits- far more expensive. What is the motive? Zero covid countries are not good for community vaccine trials. So is there pressure on Government not to follow a zero covid strategy
1003	112287	@RiyanVirtanen @RBReich False virtue in being a martyr?  You do realize you might die of Covid-19 before every minority on the planet is vaccinated, don't you.  Seems like a waste of a life just to own the white race.  Wouldn't it be better to get vaccinated, and then advocate getting everyone vaxxed?
1004	110134	@CDCgov if you already had the COVID vaccine, how will the flu vaccine affect our immune system, given the flu vaccine contains Coronavirus proteins from the chicken eggs?  Will our bodies severely over-react?
1005	110976	When the press just make stuff up and think we're are dumb.@NewshubNZ  you don't have enough evidence either way.  On the same level - Covid vaccine will not give you cancer. I can't prove that, nobody can prove the opposite. We still don't have enough data. #misinformation
1006	112039	@tomhfh It can take up to 30 years to iron all the bugs out of vaccines (as it did with Smallpox).I am willing to let others become guinea pigs to do this with #Covid19 vaccine.Any deaths or long term damage/illness just adds fuel to the fire for the anti-vax brigade.

1008	112922	@ThePatriotDavid @ImperialWick Fauci invested in Chinese companies no doubt because he's friends with Gates.

1024	108585	The bar has been set #ROC! Just vaccinated a person who ran the race then came to get their vaccine. It’s just that easy to get the Covid19 vaccine.
1025	108073	@fishluvr1 @GavinNewsom Corona virus is transmitted more easily and attacks more severely than flu. Also, there is no vaccine for coronavirus like there is for various strains of flu each year. So, they really aren’t comparable.

1028	108927	"@Breaking911 At 35.00 a jab hell yes they want everyone to get a shot forever. All my ""Conspiracy"" friends told me this would happen.  Reality = mRNA is Experimental Gene Therapy. It is nothing like a traditional Vaccine.  The Chinese are using a inactive coronavirus = no need for a booster."
1029	202345	Considering this 👇🏻 tRUmp’s lifting restrictions where the variants are flourishing like 🇧🇷 🇬🇧 👿 glad Biden reversed it. Glad I got 1st dose of #COVID19 vaccine today.
1030	110960	@HillBeverlyhill So a new conspiracy theory, Putin developed the coronavirus and has the vaccine to control the world
1031	112492	What's crazy is.. if covid only lasts 2weeks and we ALL keep ourselves clear for two weeks and the infected do not get a chance to mix with the healthy surely it wouldn't exist anymore? #COVIDー19 #COVID19 #CovidUK #CoronaVaccine
1032	109270	You have to be joking. Did you see what DeSantis did yesterday? He made an appearance @ a 'church' where members believe CoVid isn't real, and no one should get a Vaccine! DeSantis is DeDevil!
1033	108802	THE ONLY WAY OUT OF COVID IS VACCINATING YOURSELF!!!! If you hate being in a limbo between normality and lockdown, then go get that jab!!! #COVID19Vaccination
1034	111644	@truly_wild Yh that’s normal for most vaccines, they usually take over a year to make, however I meant that there’s no hope in a vaccine if our body doesn’t create antibodies against covid19 lmao bc that’s exactly what a vaccine is
1035	202286	MORE: This means, if you’ve not received your first dose of the #COVID19 #vaccine, and you have tix to the Sept. 26 game against the WFT, you cannot attend.
1036	110728	I've been waiting for this day since March 2020. Having my entire family get sick with the virus was scarier than I imagined it would be, and the vaccine for the kids helps to ensure that we can avoid it happening again.
1037	110603	But it’s not pointing a gun in someone’s face to put a gun I their face and make them take medicine?Also, please learn science. If you’re vaxxed, they aren’t a threat to you.
1038	109558	6/ If effective vaccines *don't* roll out within the next 12 months, then countries will get fierce about +/- COVID_19 status; the divide will become very rigid. Don't kid yourself that everyone will be in the same boat; they're not and they won't be.https://t.co/1fXVcis22u
1039	111713	@LisaMarieBoothe I think he plans to make bank on vaccines and he does not have good intentions.Why would he send money to China to create a genetically modified strain of coronavirus (which infected the world) when our country put a stop to it? He predicted it - and he made it happen. #Evil
1040	109129	Just enrolled our staff on the waitlist for the vaccine. We’ll see how long it takes for us to get it. 🙏💉 🦠 #COVID19 #COVID19colorado
1041	202437	Oh goodness sake, stop making a celebrity moment out of the jab. It’s nothing but PR stunt after PR stunt. It’s tiresome to see and I’m sure the last round started impacting on people’s behaviour. Almost like ‘we’ve got a vaccine let’s party’...
1042	111213	@JohnTitor33621 @realDonaldTrump OMG this is awful! Never wanted a coronavirus vaccine. Nothing from Fauci/Gates
1043	109931	How odd that China and other countries didn't require a filthy vaccine for the virus to go away.  Why does the U.S?  Oh, that's right, we are the only country that CANNOT sue them for any death or injury as they are ALL for profit! Got it!
1044	109802	This is what we call a progressive move. And a progressive initiative. Mana ada PN jaga rakyat? Mana? @Khairykj pun kata menurut artikel berita vaccine percuma untuk 7 juta orang. How about the rest? This is why @pakatanharapan_ is better for the people. @rajiv4malaysia Thanks
1045	201968	Lucknow: At least 28,331 people took the jab against Covid-19 in Lucknow on Wednesday. While 22,540 people took the second dose, 5,791 got the first. Among those vaccinated with first or second shots, 56% were men and 44% women.
1046	109930	I got vaccinated to protect my patients, my coworkers, husband, my family, my friends and myself. Vaccines work. But they work best when we all get them. #VaccinesWork #igottheshot #COVID19
1047	109348	They only care bout the money , you get the vaccine they get paid, you dont get it they fine you or jail you and they still getting paid
1048	112804	so, if its autumn before 'everyone' (who wants it) in all the groups is vaccinated, and the vaccine doesn't prevent transmission.. are we staying in this limbo life until autumn?
1049	108459	If you’re playing antivaxxer bingo:*vaccine is about control*no one has died from COVID-19*my friend had the vaccine and is now very poorly*perhaps alcohol mixes with the vaccine and makes it worse*government is trying to suppress our immune systems*masks are bad for you
1050	202359	Just had my second Covid-19 vaccine dose. Very grateful to the @nhscroydon_ staff, vaccine centre volunteers and @stjohnambulance volunteer at the site - all done efficiently and with a smile at the walk-in clinic in central #Croydon
1051	202129	I was vaccinated today! Soon 50% of Finns are vaccinated at least once. This is my highlight of the year.  #PfizerVaccine #CoronaVaccine #COVID19 #vaccination
1052	111940	Then WHAT ON EARTH is the point in having the #vaccine then?!!WHY are people queuing up to have it if it ISN'T going to END this NIGHTMARE of #lockdown, #Masks and #SocialDistancing?!! 🙄🤔For crying out loud people...will you PLEASE #WAKEUP to what the Government is doing!
1053	110101	@Jarin50926789 @sputnikvaccine In several countries. I have my first shot of Sputnik-V in Argentina on April, like millions everywhere, I had Covid-19 in May, in a very mild way
1054	109469	They are never going to stop this. We have to stand up to these satanic one world order oligarchs. They want us dead. Purpose of this is “vaccine” which they call an “Operating System.”
1055	111759	Drop in vaccine clinics are great but where is the opportunity for the youth who have worked throughout the pandemic in shops and hospitality while not being able to go to campus? Why do we get blamed but be the last to be offered the vaccine when we’re in the worst environments?

1057	202260	Margaret Keenan should be trending. The first person to have the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer at 6.45 this morning in Coventry. Well done Margaret from all of us and thank you 🥰
1058	110219	@regionofpeel @BonnieCrombie This is a bald face lie and this situation is not a standard situation as the comparisons being used. NOVEL CORONAVIRUS EUA EXPERIMENTAL USE AUTHORIZATION VACCINES the trial ends in 2023 WHO HAS STATED DO NOT MIX MFGS STATE DO NOT MIX HOSPITALS ARE NOT MIXING STOP LYING DR LOH
1059	112666	The only positive here is maybe the idiots saying this vaccine is going to ‘alter your dna’ will see this and realize how dumb they are
1060	110848	@carry_studios @TakethatCt @robinmonotti @InCytometry Only some viruses. And only in retroviruses can this reverse transcribe and insert into our DNA. Coronavirus clearly does not have this capability and the vaccine certainly doesn't
1061	202237	Got my Covid-19 booster at Walmart. Them proceeded to spend too much money because I was shopping hungry and without a list. 😐My super powers have yet to reveal themselves.
1062	108237	This is the thing I want to scream in the faces of everybody going on about opening up the lock down or letting a certain segment of the population out: You do not actually have any control over how this thing develops, till there is a viable vaccine.
1063	109999	I cannot wait to have my grandparents hold my hand as I take them for theirs. These photos are love in the truest way @Ben_Nelms 🙌🏽😭 #covid #covidvaccine
1064	109814	Republiklans are going to get so many working class people of color killed. Maryland may well have the worst racial disparities for vaccine access in the country! These next few months will be a nightmare across the south especially.
1065	110579	So you're going to talk about mis-managing, huh? I think you need to reflect on yourself, Mr. President. Now is not the time for pettiness &amp; with-holding funding from an org which is distributing test kits &amp; trying to develop a vaccine. WE ARE IN A PANDEMIC. Act like an adult.
1066	110506	His tweet mocking the vaccine went viral with anti-vaxxers, then he died because he didn't get the vaccine. That should be an example to anti-vaxxers, and everyone not getting the vaccine honestly.
1067	111058	We won’t be taking evil Gates vaccine. Not met one person who will take this, not one and trust me I ask everyone wherever I go.
1068	110445	A reminder that it's very likely multiple promising COVID-19 vaccine candidates will not succeed. But also this👇is good news to see even with trials moving so quickly protocols working. Pauses are normal, this is scientists working to keep us safe.
1069	110474	This is what I was able to get. Almost no reaction to either shot. Waiting for a booster. I've read it's good to get one about 8 months after the last?
1070	110124	@CapsNats822 I worked the H1N1 pandemic. We got the first vaccines out by October. And that’s with a virus we know and can develop vaccines quickly...it takes months but that’s quick. We don’t have that with Coronavirus. There’s no vaccine to duplicate. And RNA viruses, like HIV, are hard if
1071	110656	"@Aerin_SG17 ""I know how strongly you feel about it. We don't need to spend our time together talking about it again. *change subject*Miscarriages are heartbreaking, but there's no reason to think the vaccine would cause one (unless you are pregnant with a coronavirus)"
1072	107745	Do NOT get your kids the Covid-19 shot, also known as the Vaccine. Why it’s called a vaccine is beyond me. Vaccine ACTUALLY prevent the spread of the disease!!
1073	111842	"I'm 84 and CAN'T GET CLOSE TO A VACCINE!""WAR""? Not against COVID, WAR is against our CITIZENS! How can they FEED troops?How can they handle NECESSARY LOGISTICS to VACCINATE properly against COVID?If they're not MAKING $$$then we don't get NEEDED VACCINE!..??"

Everything happening now is prophecy
1076	110637	"@upstaterino Useless meme. ""Trust the Science"" but only when it feeds my narrative. THERE IS NO VACCINE WHICH PREVENTS COVID19.  Vaxed can still get and spread the virus. Vaxed does not mean immune, just like unvaxed does not mean infected. #FJB #FuckJoeBiden and any #VaccineMandate!"
1077	107783	#CNNTownHall How is covid19 being handled in the world's poorer countries, such as Nigeria, the DRC, Indonesia and - especially - India (where the numbers appear terrifying in what they DON'T show)? How do we plan to help these countries if a vaccine is found?
1078	109744	And if there isn’t a vaccine (which is very likely)... what a ridiculous idea. And pay for it how? And frankly, I don’t want to stay home; I like living, not hibernating.
1079	202242	Received the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine this afternoon. Grateful for all the scientific and medical professionals who made this happen.
1080	110798	@SRuhle So, this small company gets contract money from Trump and a hugh relief payment to make syringes for the COVID-19 vaccine.  But because it's Sooo tiny, there is no way it can deliver the amount of syringes that are needed. Even if a vaccine is developed, no way to administer it!
1081	201957	Got my #COVID19 shot this morning #CovidVaccine #streamerlife #twitchcommunity #HealthyLiving @antifri3nd5 @BlazedRTs https://t.co/vLsZxoUmWN
1082	202069	@aussiemoose Getting my flu Vax today but not holding my breath for the COVID-19 vaccine. I had hoped that the government, given the importance of the roll-out, they might just not stuff it up.

1089	110674	Never in my life would I have imagined that medical science could quite swiftly develop effective vaccines against the worst pandemic in US history--and that so may people would reject it because they belong to some demented psycho-death cult. #COVID19
1090	111589	scaring me, I am not vaxxed, i went to a family funeral, did the cheek hugging thing w the people, now I have sore on my cheek I cannot get it to heal...any advise would be appreciated..MDs do not know how to treat so I will not go there.
1091	111206	"Good to know.Where is the vaccine that Trudeau promised ?Anyone @CTVToronto want to press the federal government for the specifics on the ""how much and when"" deliveries will take place? Everyone has orders in.How about specific dates and quantities questions for the PM. #topoli"
1092	107754	COVID’s full name is SARS-COV-2 and we have had many forms of coronavirus and SARS in our history. They put an emergency authorization for a vaccine because of how many people have died and are dying. The system of how these vaccine will work is kinda similar to the flu vaccine
1093	111878	The Coronavirus vaccinations are free of charge, the NHS will never ask for your bank account or card details.Check out this image for more information!#MBKB #Coronavirus #Covid19 #Vaccine #NHS #Scams #VaccineProgram #Aged55AndOver #UnpaidCarers
1094	108195	When the coronavirus vaccine is developed, im going to a rave. Never had the desire to do so until the ability to was taken away from me 😂
1095	111449	This a-hole is a child just like Trump. Using the vaccine to punish people who dare criticize him. How do these spoiled brats get into office? This is not public service.
1096	112547	@CDCgov @KING5Seattle If the PCR tests work-Why the false positivesIf the masks work-Why the 6 feetIf 6 feet works-Why the masks If all three work-Why the lockdownsIf all four work-Why the vaccineIf the vaccine is safe-Why the no liability clauseIf Covid-19 exists-Why has it not been isolated
1097	112079	Don't give an ear to what some of our celeb are saying concerning Covid-19 vaccine, if the Western countries want to demolish every being is Africa, they go fi do dat through the importation of food to our African countries. Get ur vaccine, protect ur family and friends.
1098	110909	We don’t want that vaccine. All the politicians must take it first. We will wait for two years then decide.
1099	202287	@FloridaMedical just got my #COVID19 #vaccine Still need to #MaskUp and #SocialDistance but first important step. Thank you to all the individuals who made this possible. @CDCgov @DrNancyM_CDC @NIH and all the staff and scientists. Get your #vaccination https://t.co/5nr7rB2tCN
1100	112481	@LisaRob23467689 @disclosetv @zs3j_ Smallpox only affects humans. Coronavirus does not. There has never been a vaccine that has ever irradiated a coronavirus. This one is no exception. Get vaccinated if you want but don’t force your pseudo science crap into minds to guilt trip people into making your life choice.
1101	109349	While we are holed up at our homes, the world we know is slowly fading and if  vaccine is not found soon the one we will come out to will be completely different. #COVID19Pandemic #COVID19 #StayAtHome
1102	109548	@centerrightsin1 @WhiteMamba_WVU @ARmastrangelo Vaccines don't work that well? Is that why polio has been wiped out in most of the world?Vaccines for flu need to change each year because flu changes rapidly. Coronaviruses don't.We can't protect people if we run up the white flag and let covid-19 rip through our population.
1103	202048	First dose of Covid19 done today! Let’s defeat Covid19! Lez go! #Pfizervaccine https://t.co/lW2aoCKp3u
1104	107820	COVID-19 is an old people's illness, not children. If the vaccine is so effective there is no reason to fear they will transmit it to those vaccinated. This has to stop.
1105	110152	@AlexBerenson @TsicsafPelosi @BioNTech_Group A good friend of mine said he had the worst flu-like symptoms in years and was in bed for four days after getting the second shot of the vaccine.The coronavirus would have caused less severe symptoms.
1106	110612	@PhilCL2 @hugotalks1 Don't forget they want to control and secure the Internet for home or any persons use, am sure it will soon need a verification just to use the Internet like the covid-19 vaccine passport!  I gather Mr Billy Gates wants will do something with the new windows 11 operating system!
1107	108677	Maybe, just maybe it was a BAD idea to lift shelter-in-place in certain counties in Cali because people are fucking idiots and think no shelter-in-place means no masks. Don’t mind sheltering for until we get a vaccine. 🤦🏻‍♀️
1108	111450	@FOLLOW_DA_BUCKS Put your money where your mouth is. 1 bet you 1,000 x 1 up to the value of $100 that if I take the Covid-19 vaccine I will be ok. To be clear, you bet $100, if you win you get 100,000 $$$. I would pay up. In my experience, I have won bets like these and the loser can't even pay
1109	109599	@Qualib_us @kuliroberts @TakaTina1 I did not suggest travelling during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Actually, Covid-19 in a way does fall from the sky as it is an airborne virus. 😂 Bro, my point is, stop spreading conspiracy theories about vaccines that have no basis in fact. ✌️
1110	111148	'It's gonna be brilliant when all the scientists develop a vaccine and start mass vaccinations to save humanity, especially the poor and vulnerable, for free!'

1115	112881	@VividChaosArt @CDCgov Giving coronavirus vaccines to kids is the same as child abuse.I'm not antivax. Kids should get flu/tetanus/HIV shots. But vaccine that is still basically in trials and developed in less than a year for kids who have immune systems to protect them? You're crazy.
1116	110704	"2) Now regarding the Covid-19 vaccines, here is my view, if you want to get it then go get it, no one is stopping you! They're even having ""incentives"" and ""lotteries"" now to get people to get the jab (yeah that just makes me even less likely to trust them) IT'S A PERSONAL CHOICE"
1117	108976	God it'd just warm your heart, I can't wait until my own grandparents can get the vaccine, &amp; then my parents &amp; myself &amp; my friends
1118	110392	@NEWSTALK1010 .....and you can still get sick after the second jab.  The jab does NOT prevent #COVID19, it only lessens the symptoms.  Someone please clarify why we are still calling it a vaccine?
1119	111487	Jesus. When will the lying #complicitGOP have had enough of this #TrumpIsAnIdiot bullshit? Why won’t the #GOPCorruptionOverCountry  put the country and free world first above this #trumpdotard  AIDS vaccine? This is insanity, Americans
1120	110077	@FreeLancerInc @MichelV69 @subvoyeur First, there is nothing new about this vaccine. The science has been tested and been around in other vaccines for probably decades which means that it is actually well tested. The only question was would the coronavirus genome work to produce immunity. Not whether it was safe.
1121	201985	Reasons I got the vaccine-Protect my family-minimize time off from my business if I got it.-Saw the varied effects &amp; complications it had on people I knew that had gotten Covid &amp; didn't want to roll the dice on what it would do to me-I'm in strangers homes everyday

1124	201938	wait so the headache im currently experiencing as a result of my second dose of the vaccine was unnecessary 😭
1125	112624	@deelomas I would get a test, you can still get covid19 post vaccine. I have a, really bad cold with similar symptoms to you, so you may just have something like that. If you get a test please have a pcr one, LFs are for asymptomatic testing only.

1128	109188	"Vaccine won't work? Madrid (CNN)Spain's large-scale study on the coronavirus indicates just 5% of its population has developed antibodies, strengthening evidence that a so-called herd immunity to Covid-19 is ""unachievable,"" the medical journal the Lancet reported on Monday."
1129	109097	Suppose there was a #coronavirus vaccine to prevent an outbreak, but certain people were too vulnerable for it (infants, cancer patients, elderly...).  The only way to protect the vulnerable would be for everyone else to get the vaccine.  Would you support the #antivax ers??
1130	111372	Get the vaccines for us if they are holding out for not giving Trump credit we will make our own enemies list and work-around destroy their credibility and get them out
1131	110169	@MailOnline Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines.

1136	109227	If only we knew where all this anti-Asian hate comes from! Making vaccines this way has been normal for decades but the NYT is just like “Chinese people eat gross things lol they’re such barbarians.” #mepolitics
1137	108129	If the #COVID vaccine is invented overseas, or produced overseas, who are we going to call to get doses for Americans?
1138	108338	Another reminder that you do not need to wait 90 days after having COVID-19 to get the vaccine. You only need to wait if you’ve had a COVID plasma transfusion. Get your vaccine as soon as you can!
1139	108491	Ever notice how these anti vaxx mom's have been suddenly really silent or really racist about #coronavirus ? You know the same ones who purposefully get their kids sick to be immune without vaccines
1140	112526	If ya don’t know Dolly donated $1 mil to the research of the coronavirus vaccine and Trump denied coronavirus’s legitimacy as a actual deadly virus almost entirely until he tested positive 💕

1156	111620	@KidRock2199 @nytimes What would he do different? A vaccine is the only solution and Trump already did that. BTW every other country in the world still has coronavirus after 1460 days.
1157	111055	It is a scary chart for all of us, not just Moscow and Brasilia. This is a global pandemic, and a global fight. It doesn’t matter if one country beats it if others don’t, it will keep coming back until we have a vaccine.

1164	108296	Also I can’t believe this has to be said, but:If you’ve found a way to sign up for the vaccine when you aren’t even high risk- YOU SUCK. People like my mom NEED this more than you WANT it. Please, please, PLEASE let them go first! Be a decent human being in 2021.
1165	112014	If Johnson &amp; Johnson are the first to patent a vaccine then they will hold the whole world to ransom.  Let’s hope China, who are already in first phase trialing a vaccine, develop it first.
1166	110776	Giving them extra help is good, but the problem is that POC are not all the same.Native Americans are in remote areas without hospitals.Blacks do not BELIEVE in the virus (so no masks), or the vaccine.Hispanics are frontline workers and do not understand the transmission.

1170	108212	@99freemind Personally I think Trump just wants a vaccine that is not connected with Bill Gates or anyone on the left and then he can administer it and end this coronavirus nonsense.  I don't know if that's the case or if there is something else going on that we haven't seen just yet.
1171	109823	@bopinion Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
1172	110763	Okay I love unions and I’m part of one, but what the hell. Why wouldn’t you get the vaccine ESPECIALLY if you work for the state?? Like I understand an extension because of the length for the 2nd dose, but to completely bar the requirement? Please make it make sense, I’m tired 😪
1173	110753	that is the safest vaccine there is.  I don't blame them.  @DrCori1 I thought you would get a kick out of this one

1178	109738	Before this covid-19 virus is over if it ever is we will see one million plus deaths in our country! We don't know enough about the vaccines ! How long will they last? Will they work against these new strains of coronavirus? We still have a lot to learn and deaths to come!
1179	108193	This can’t go on. Are they going to make mates rich with the vaccine “deployment” and then discover it was another disaster, @Keir_Starmer ? We want transparency, accountability and the lot prosecuted. It’s too late already. It only takes 3.5% #COVID19 #NHS #KilledByTories
1180	111300	This is amazing. Unfortunately, my son just tested positive for Covid and we’re all isolating and hoping his case stays mild. He is four, so wouldn’t have been eligible for another couple of months, but such a bummer that he got sick so close to vaccine availability!
1181	110586	@RepAndyBiggsAZ @M_William_1985 Jackass Fauci have patent on coronavirus I wonder how he got the patent.  Now he is  producing the  coronavirus  vaccine with Lonza company. Very soon  he will on of the top ten  billionaire in the world. He all way lie to the people in America. He is a crook.

1183	107997	@TexCIS calm down chicken little. Its not the influenza virus, its coronavirus. Same family that contains the common cold. It has LESS fatalities than the flu. There are vaccines for all other strains of coronavirus, we've had experience with them many x before. SARS is coronavirus too
1184	109374	@pfizer @BioNTech_Group They’ve been working on the flu vaccine for 60 years and it’s only 20-60% effective, but somehow they’ve developed a COVID-19 vaccine that’s 95% effective in just a few months.
1185	111676	The jabs are not working to keep infections down in other countries, masks don't work, maybe shoot people with rubber bullets  like they do in Oz
1186	108574	I bet you guys are going to run right out and get this vaccine now huh? LMAO they're just screaming we're trying to sterilize you right in your face it's kind of like the joke they played on us all year the Joe Biden joke..
1187	108930	@JoeBiden How can you use theese words?Für more tham 70 jears the world is working fon a vaccine against the flu. What is the resut?Why do you think, the COVID-19 can be beaten so quickly?
1188	108596	Just this. Why is it even a question? Mandate masks in schools and mandate vaccines for ALL school employees and all students old enough to get the vaccine. It's insane that we're not doing this already.

1195	112793	@CDCgov If half of what you guys say about these viruses were true, I'd have been dead for the past 27 years. I have no immune system. Lost my spleen. Until Covid-19 nobody ever mentioned a mask or vaccines to me. Hell I wasn't even made to take the flu shot. It's optional for me still.
1196	110255	pandemic starting in China that the US puts the blame on them. Look, the Covid-19 pandemic is not on purpose. China is just trying to find a vaccine to cure foe the Coronavirus. Other countries are doing the same, but the US is blaming China for it. I think this is an act of (3)
1197	110518	Great news. Is this a mutated strain, or just a different one, or is it near its end of life? There is no guarantee that there isn't stronger one lurking out there. How can a vaccine be developed if there are different versions floating out there.

This is Shirley a plague have been put on Earth. You got a good cloth mask and beg your family have one
1200	111473	Can someone kindly take the liberty to educate the rest of us who have not had the COVID19 vaccine on what path to take?🙏 There is so much confusion, yet with no choices or little if any on what vaccine is available and safe!
1201	109265	Indeed there is but it just so happens that they have a vaccine for the virus that is causing the world havoc...
1202	112799	@RuhakanaR @MinofHealthUG @Vinepharma Is it an original or fake vaccine? I have received my COVID-19 vaccine from vine pharmacy mukono mall but they have not given the vaccination card of the ministry of health so are they authorised to give the vaccine ?
1203	109684	1666A: Every nation is trying to better the other in  developing the vaccine for coronavirus and there is a race going on. Every other day, someone releases successful results of a testing phase which makes commoners like me feel like the cure is around the corner. But its not.

1205	109281	@EdwardTHardy Seems we have now morphed into the Coronavirus Delta KARMA Variant.This specific variant only attacks morons and assholes.  There is no vaccine.
1206	112355	People are also getting this assumption that after getting COVID-19 vaccine means they can stop wearing  mask and taking coronavirus precautions because Vaccines don't stop the virus from entering the body they only prevent you by developing immunity.#StrongAgainstCovid

1208	112131	I didnt share this bcuz imo vaccines are incredibly safe and the best course of action in fighting covid-19 right now BUTI lost vision in my right for about a week immediately following my vaccine, I've got most of my vision back but im still struggling
1209	108514	@peszeke There is no biological imperative for the virus to only mutate to milder strains. As long as humans do such a good job of passing this thing around, coronavirus doesn’t have to worry about keeping its hosts upright. That’s why NPI are just as urgent as vaccines right now.

1211	107911	@CraftyJas @BBCBreakfast Pfizer vaccine has the same (slightly higher) rate of clotting. It's just countries haven't suspended using it so it's not in the media. Both vaccines have risks. The virus has risks. I'd rather get the vaccine than coronavirus.
1212	110593	It could be worse, schengen already making covid-19 vaccines a visa requirement.Americans please support Trumps 2nd coming, he is key. If America gets a rubber stamp potus you can be rest assured vaccines will not only become a visa requirement but the new social security no.

1263	110349	wait 4 years before they can go back to work and it's much more likely that people will develop the antibodies that will protect them from this Coronavirus long before a vaccine comes to market even if they do it in 18 months or less.
1264	201916	My mother received her first Covid-19 vaccination shot today. It was the Moderna vaccine. She was speaking in tongues and hissing like a gargoyle afterwards. but is otherwise fine.
1265	109577	Have I missed the part where they isolated the virus to begin with? I’m curious to understand how a vaccine could be created without isolating the virus first. Or is that not even necessary? If anyone understands this, please let us know.
1266	110605	Why? 1 person who is jabbed has caught covid and has mild symptoms.Explain how that justifies a pause.
1267	108618	@nypost Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
1268	112058	So you can publish the data on the isolated genome that is the root cause then?If you can do that then you don't need any man made jab but an actual vaccine containing dead cells...or don't you have any???
1269	108181	@PeterKolchinsky @CityJournal If you're a virologist, then please discuss ADE as it pertains to coronavirus, and what the implications are for success in making a vaccine for this virus.Noting that infection with coronavirus does not convey long-term immunity, of course...
1270	110807	For those on my TLFor those who are in the UK, take the oxford vaccine, asap For those who have already had the vaccine, remember to have 2nd inoculation.But importantly still social distance and take precautions once you have had the vaccine.#covid19
1271	110801	@fact_covid  This is great news but once the #Coronavirus vaccine starts being rolled out, how will we prove we've had it and therefore safe to travel? Will it be like Yellow Fever where you get a certificate of vaccination?
1272	112233	I have been waiting for months in Australia for my #covid19 vaccine while my American friend has already been fully vaccinated its really fucking infuriating being in the dark about what's going on and when I heard I am going to have to wait until September for the Pfizer vaccine
1273	202394	My job is forcing me to be jabbed.literally #NoJabNoJob. Ive never felt so low in my entire life. #MyBodyMyChoice no longer applies. I fear for my life &amp; #SideEffects#VaccinationIsNotCompulsary #vaccine #Pfizer #COVID19 #coronavirus #vaccines #VaccineMandate  #CovidVaccine
1274	112533	@glassforsenate False.  This is merely a statement from an outside organization, NOT a bill.  There is NO evidence that the state has any plans to make the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory.
1275	109204	This astonishes me. I have young freinds who have had Covid, even donating antibodies- there is no way they need a vaccine.
1276	111067	@joh_public @DangerousGlobe @ChrisWickNews @trixasis2 Brother.We have no cure for coronavirus. Not the common cold, not SARS MERS or influenza.This vaccine does not cure or eradicate a virus.For that reason alone, lockdowns, mandatory vax, is merely impeding on human rights.This isn't POLIO, a non mutagenic virus.
1277	108521	Congress Has To Change Their President... Bs... If This Is Done... Then For Sure Congress Will Be Back In Its Full From... But Rahul And Sonia Jii Has To Understand This Point... @INCIndia @RahulGandhi #Sachin_pilot #RajasthanPolitics #Rajasthan #BJP #coronavaccine #coronavirus
1278	107930	@IrenaArts No one is forced to take a vaccine. The numbers willing to accept the Covid-19 vaccines are probably high enough to achieve herd immunity so the population will be safe. The issue then is focusing on making individuals safe. If you accept the vaccine, you make yourself safe.
1279	110868	I'll be with you Bernie! I don't even have the bloody stupid app on my phone and that's how it's going to stay. Even if they issued a paper form of proof, it would go in the shredder.#NoVaccinePassportsAnywhere
1280	108519	"if the ""vaccines"" work then why to those with them worry about those who don't get the jab?  The vaccinated still get and spread covid-19 &amp; it is proven they actually carry a higher viral load then those who don't get the jab. somebody explain this to me please."
1281	109169	@KO_Officer @birdbraininves1 @frankmentalizm @mcuban There has never been an instance of vaccine effects after 2 months, in history, with any vaccine.This coronavirus is new, and has killed over 700,000 people.  But you stick with that narrative you're so married to.
1282	202178	Both kids received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine!Science Rules!!!#CovidVaccine #vaccinated https://t.co/Is1e1YrP2J
1283	111516	Had my kids do a Cause and Effect assignment about COVID-19 and it’s amazing to see the types of answers I’m getting. They all want a vaccine. They’re all staying home. They all say they miss school but they’re happy to be home.…Can my class run the country? Or state? Please?
1284	112651	This is the face of fascism, I guarantee that once vaccines come out, people will have show proof they took it to move around.
1285	112930	Intel drop. ⬇️⬇️⬇️Makes total sense. [They] would never release a bioweapon unless they had the antidote (vaccine) for themselves. Of course the vaccine [they] have planned for us is Not the same one [they] take.#CoronaVirus #CoronavirusPandemic #GatesForPrison2020
1286	112247	@JamesBa054 @RhondaMathews1 @gracewontshutup @carney_17 @thehori @MollyJongFast @Jim_Jordan Don't forget that #coronavirus hoax the ENTIRE WORLD 🌍 is in on, to make Trump &amp; the GOP look bad.Oh and the billions Bill Gates is spending on vaccine research, so he can uh, get rich...
1287	109528	If restaurants want to keep their patrons coming back all year long, they need to start requiring proof of vaccine for indoor dining.
1288	110363	"""why is this vaccine we made to stop something that doesn't exist in the same way anymore not working?!"""
1289	112834	I got my first dose of the Covid Vaccine 💉. And I feel ok ( It depends on the days). I want to be able to see my grandparents and my high risk friends. Plz get the vaccine!! #GetVaccinated #COVID19
1290	112062	There will never be a vaccine for Covid-19 because flu virus mutate just like other flu viruses #CoronaBollocks  #gmb
1291	202101	Covid coming to an immune system near youI was vaccinated and contracted the virus. Felt sick for about 36 hours, also my father who is vaccinated also caught the virus. He too was fine within two days.Vaccine made the sickness minimal but everyone's gonna get itStay safe
1292	110549	I hate that he gets a vaccine before so many who need it but...this is necessary. Can't overstate the impact on voters, especially skeptics, who need to see elected officials taking the vaccine.
1293	111550	Dem dey beg my village people to comarn tek covid-19 vaccine.They promised to give them a cartoon of noodles if they do. 🤣🤣
1294	109572	@nate0902 @PaulOCo94834963 @DirtyWater1242 @CodeRed6789 @JoeBiden Likewise I’ve been vaccinated for influenza and COVID-19 and I’ve had both of them in my lifetime. Why? I would have to assume, the vaccine didn’t work. With COVID my symptoms were mild but so were the unvaxed thanks to Omicron. The flu not so mild.
1295	202430	Very happy that my mother and grandmother are now eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. Now how do I get them to take it? 🧐
1296	112942	Don't care which political party you support. But these innocent people just want to get a vaccine shot. They are suffering. No one talks about them. They traveled and got nothing. Everything is politics, even human lives.
1297	108332	@Craig_A_Spencer I do think that once the vaccine has reached a majority of the population, Covid-19 will be comparable to influenza in terms of lethality, but that’s still a long way off. I’m qualified for a schedule 1a vaccine, but NYC is so understocked, it’ll take months for my inoculation.
1298	202089	@Politics_PR Question, does getting the vaccine stop people from being able to spread Covid-19?  My vaccinated daughter-in-law has Covid-19 right now along with my son &amp; grandbaby so if I come in contact with my daughter-in-law can she spread it to me since she's vaccinated?
1299	112215	The pandemic is not over. I've received one does of the Moderna vaccine, going for my second in two weeks. Mask up, keep it up, because this is happening in Canada and it can very easily happen here, if it hasn't already started.
1300	111137	There was an israelie study in September/October that showed booster immunity wanes after just 12 days. There has never been a successful coronavirus vaccine and this one is no different.
1301	108668	So does this mean I am extra protected with natural immunity and the vaccine? Hope so. Really don’t want to experience it again 🙅🏻‍♀️
1302	110272	@10DowningStreet @BorisJohnson @BBCNews my son has a very high phobia of needles and wants the vaccine but won’t have a needle, how do we sort it out #COVID19
1303	111745	@Jimcorrsays is exactly right here.The flu shot is a campaign to incite COVID symptoms, further perpetuate the lockdowns, continue the public fear, &amp; then offer their solution.Their vaccine.The question is why, why is it important to get the covid vaccine...
1304	112620	Bro I’m out here reading the vaccine module that they give you and shit says “The vaccine is an unapproved vaccine that may prevent Covid-19 and it’s not FDA approved” 😐 Why are we getting this shit then
1305	112674	patience, it’s just around the corner for vaccine. meanwhile,  #stayathome #maximizestayathome a little bit longer before everything returns to normal #coronavirus
1306	108797	@BreitbartNews There will be no vaccine for covid19, just like there is no vaccine for ebola, MERS, SARS or H1N1...
1307	109369	@RatatoskrUK @joncoopertweets I guess  I've got no reason  to be angry  either huh. My perfectly  healthy  daughter  bought into the fear that's been pushed and took the vax. Now she has serious liver issues  and is borderline  liver failure.  Why? COVID-19 Vaccine  Injury.  A life if misery awaits her.
1308	111445	@Reuters If they can develop vaccines for COVID-19 this fast, there is no excuse anymore as to why there are not vaccines for other diseases!
1309	108276	The same #Pfizer who have in the past paid out milllions &amp; millions in law suits for #Vaccine damage ? This #vaccine is an an experiment it has not been passed as safe until 2023.   We are the guinea pigs &amp; No Child should be exposed to this !!!!
1310	111096	Just Say No For The COVID-19 Vaccine.Everyone Will Get Sick Regardless If You're Vaccinated Or Not, And Symptoms Will Not Be Any Worse If You're Not Vaccinated.
1311	112051	Now they are going after The Navy Seals over the Covid-19 vaccine. When are they gonna stop. I want to know who’s making these decisions Hunter   Because who ever it is they’ve got to be high
1312	112855	If there was a vaccine for this coronavirus all this economic impact could be avoided. But you see vaccines are not money makers so they are not funded well.
1313	111938	Trumpets are really stupid. Instead of getting a free vaccine plus a vaccine card these idiots got no vaccine and paid $200 for a fake card.
1314	110892	@GovernorTomWolf Don't do it one covid-19 was just made up so you dummies out there who are still wearing masks could think that Trump was bad yes it's true the vaccine is to control you and it is also too poison you down the road I will not get the vaccine
1315	108836	How many have seen tweets &amp; heard people say with swagger and resolve - I'm not getting a #Covid19 vaccine?Reminds me of the kid in school who boasts that they're not going to study for the test.......Why do they need to broadcast those messages?
1316	110629	When they find vaccine for Coronavirus  because our fellow south African are saying because of this pendemicPlease Africa and American please this ring mast coming to be the and know
1317	110107	@CPHO_Canada What are you talking about?! No one between the ages of 18-55 are even eligible. So why put that misleading title up. I’m 34 even I don’t expect to get a vaccine this year the way it’s going.  #COVID19 #CovidVaccine #covidontario

1319	112756	@spectatorindex JUST IN: Russia's president Putin has announced the registration of the first coronavirus vaccine
1320	109892	@JTuladew @dobrock @thehill We've been testing the sars coronavirus vaccines on humans since 2004.So, 17 years.Yes, it's 'faster' than those in the past but that's because of advances in molecular biology and information technology.And yes, it's a vaccine.
1321	112206	imagine thinking it’s okay to drive to another part of the state and see a bunch of your bros because “i won’t get coronavirus” if it’s that easy there’s no need to develop a vaccine i guess!
1322	112696	Does Twitter even post people who make the remarks about the covid-19 if you're against the vaccine I think they can't kick it off I don't even think they would if you'd believe it talk about it if you're not pro-vaccination they don't even let your comments go on
1323	109091	#nspoli #backtoschool #COVID19 #vaccine WHY ARE WE NOT CLOSING SHIT DOWN! I DONT GET IT… NUMBERS ARE RISING YES STAYING HOME IS DIFFICULT BUT ID RATHER BE SAFE THEN SORRY! CLOSE THE PROVINCES BACK DOWN UNTIL ITS UNDER CONTROL! PLEASE!
1324	110672	"@TaisonBell If a person recieves a vaccine for diptheria, polio, measles, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, meningitis ... they do not contract those diseases. If a person recieves the experimental, mRNA COVID-19 ""vaccine,"" they can still contract, and pass on, COVID-19."
1325	112895	@realDonaldTrump Not even close to accurate. The stock market is not the economy. There are still millions out of work and the Coronavirus is still a Pandemic. There is no vaccine and your political stunts won’t prove a vaccine’s efficacy.
1326	112034	Now I don’t work in branding/marketing as such, but Lordy: ‘Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine will now be known as “Comirnaty,” Health Canada wrote. Moderna’s, meanwhile, has been dubbed “Spikevax” and AstraZeneca’s will be called “Vaxzevria.”’
1327	110571	So, during the interval between the 2 shots for the vaccine - they’re advising to avoid consuming any alcohol until our immune system accepts &amp; gets used to itYeah...it’s going to be lockdown level 5 all over again if that’s the vaccine route in South Africa 😭😂
1328	111695	Got my first dose of Coronavirus COVID-19 Moderna vaccine. My arm is sore, I feel kind of dizzy or like I've been in ocean too long. Still no big deal. I think the virus is a joke but whatever, if it makes it easier on me and people will leave me alone, I'll get the vaccination.
1329	110129	Worth watching this 1 min video if you think that you will not be getting the Covid-19 vaccine.The question is why Gates does this. It isn’t for money. He is an ideologue and truly believes that he is doing something positive for the world: he also wants to reduce population
1330	112769	@___decipher___ @metamacky @savanna_jeffrey @BBCNews There is too much uncertainty surrounding this vaccine so I'm in no rush to take it. Need to take a step back and analyse before making the decision to take it or not. Coronavirus also doesn't seem as serious and deadly as previously thought either.
1331	110598	Ignorance is going to be the end of human existence. You want any sense of normal back in our lives, get the vaccine.
1332	109489	@rath_erin @chipcoffey *Diseases.  So what you're implying is that everyone that gets sick should just hope for the best that they don't end up dead instead of doing what they can to get better?  No wonder the US is where it is with COVID-19 with that thinking.  Vaccines Work.
1333	112754	The Modi government refused to do adequate pandemic planning--they had a year to do this.Misinformation has hurt people, too.Now, the need is supported shelter in place with food aid&amp; free vaccines for all. Although, vax weren't ordered, either.#COVIDSecondWave
1334	112709	Wait just a minute, they put laxatives in the #mRNA #CovidVaccines, seriously look it up, they put miralax in the shot, why?! So when #COVID19 enters our system we can poop it out?! #headscratcher
1335	109499	PREVENTABLE! What a shame!“I didn’t think they were as bad as they are, and they are, they’re terrible, I mean, they’re terrible and it is rough,” @TLSLiveShow #Shenanigans #COVID19 #Corona #CoronavirusUpdates #VaccinesWork #vaccine #WearAMask #StopTheSpread #stopthedeaths

1338	110066	I guess everyone who said they wouldn't get the vaccine because it wasn't fully approved by the FDA will be rushing out to get it now 🙃
1339	112663	I have had 2 letters, 3 texts, 3 phone calls asking if I want the MRNA vaccine.  I've been consistent with my answer ie NO.  I've had confirmed Covid-19 and know what to expect if I get it again, thank you!  If this isn't Government Coercion then I don't know what is.
1340	110442	Can’t wait for the hateful comments from Philly MAGA. Anyone with a brain has already gotten vaxxed. Philly MAGA will deny it until their lungs start filling up with thick gunk. Then they run to the hospital with all the science that they don’t believe in.
1341	112418	@theNAhousehippo @shmalk305 @tomjbrenner @stphnmaher @Mikeggibbs You don’t get long covid with the coronavirus jab then?
1342	111255	Since vaccines aren't helping to suppress CORONAVIRUS, why not go herbal? Give those that are affected Bitter Kola (Garcinia kola,) to chew since it act as antibacterial and ANTI VIRUS. A try won't be bad. @ChinaDaily @XHNews @PDChina @DrMarcSiegel
1343	108008	Important. People can still harbour virus in their nose &amp; throat, so immunity doesn’t mean you cannot pass it on. May be an issue with vaccines. Only way to get out of that dilemma is Whole population vaccination with high uptake esp in vulnerable categories
1344	112199	. @GMB @piersmorgan @susannareid100 @ONS figures should have finnished @MattHancock but he brings out another whopper!He led us to believe @UniofOxford is close to a vaccine...when in fact all he’s done is donate £20m to it@BristolUni been working on #coronavirus for months..
1345	111315	Anti-vaxxers that say Bill Gates wants to use the vaccine to control world population will say it implanted something else.
1346	109451	@DeAnna4Congress Must be for COVID-19, not COVID-20, because viruses don't mutate anymore, they just stay COVID-19 until a 'vaccine' is provided. 🤔
1347	111054	Truth is, everyone is rushing out to catch #COVID19 again. Those queing, those unaware they're asymptomatic. Yep well done @BorisJohnson the least you could've done is made sure everyone had been given their first dose of the vaccine. Herd immunity continuation.
1348	110887	Unfortunately people who are skeptical are still going to stay skeptical.  They will cling on to the other conspiracy theories as justification to not get it. They still are ignorant about how vaccines works.
1349	109193	My 92 year-old Mum-in-law will be among the first ever to get the coronavirus vaccine as a care home resident in the UK. But feels too entitled. She wants young people should get it first. #COVID19Vaccine
1350	111308	Until a vaccine is made available for everyone, we must always act like we already have the virus and we don't want others to get it from us. #COVID19 #NewNormal #StayHealthy #StaySafe #ACTogether #SocialDistancing
1351	109795	I reviewed your article and find it is fundamentally flawed; i.e. there will never be a vaccine. There is no vaccine for any of the coronavirus as a class, including SARS, MERS, the Asian flu of 1957 or the Spanish flu of 1918. Basing financial decisions on bad science is dumb
1352	108974	@realDonaldTrump We don’t need an experimental vaccine for the Common Cold virus a Coronavirus. The media is preying on people’s ignorance by calling it a “Novel Coronavirus.” FYI: If vaccines are so safe, why aren’t vaccine manufacturers liable for vaccine injuries?
1353	201845	This is so great. I'm going to have all my vaccine information tattooed on my body in case I lose my card--but where?
1354	108918	@LiesTbe @WendyBellPgh Polio also isn't completely eradicated globally either. Neither is the flu. Smallpox is the only disease completely prevented from vaccines.  The reason vaccines exist is to get to herd immunity without massive death. The flu and coronavirus are two completely different viruses
1355	110882	@AroncodyB Um. She Worked for Fauci developing vaccines. There isn’t even a Gold standard to test for Coronavirus so how will they develop a vaccine🤷🏼‍♀️SARS 1 was 17 yrs ago and still no vaccine. But hey, can develop a vaccine for SARS 2 right away.  Yup.
1356	112656	This is absolutely correct. What is the benefits of giving elders in #LTCH  #COVID19Vaccine yet they remain isolated in their rooms. Loneliness is a major cause for depression and loss of will to live.  Elders need to be protected not to be treated as prison inmates.GET THEM OUT
1357	112303	@danwb92 @runtalkrun Is Covid-19 Vaccine SAFE for Pregnant Women ? ? ? HELL NO !!! Don’t you dare sign that paper unless you can prove 100 % there are absolutely NO BIRTH DEFECTS. (Testing will take 9 months plus 2 years) We don’t want no COVID BABIES.
1358	112083	@aproko_doctor Las Las that vaccine na microchip. Is not covid-19 vaccine. That vaccine will enjoy your whole DNA. Is not Ordinary covid-19 vaccine.

1360	111828	Gates..who had ownership interest in the Wuhan lab near ground zero of the virus release?  Who had a patent on a Coronavirus two years ago?  Who is now all for a vaccine for the thing he helped create?  Respect? My Contempt is Growing  ...

1364	109407	So this is supposed to make you feel better about getting a vaccine that hasn’t gone through the typical trials, they’ve recruited top ad execs to trick you into getting it. You know, like they did for cigarettes and opioids.
1365	109865	@jsolomonReports We are screwed !!  Short and long term effects of this disease on humans are NOT known. This is no ordinary virus. folks, novel COVID19 means NEW. OUR rights are gonna go by the wayside soon, forced vaccine in order to work is coming eventually. MAY GOD HELP US ALL.
1366	110435	I didn’t expect how giddy I would feel to get my first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. May y’all dispatch this plague upon on us with haste.
1367	111483	All military personnel MUST be ordered to take the vaccine....if they refuse, they should be dishonorably discharged immediately! Period!
1368	110391	"My concern is that, since there are multiple strain already, is one vaccine gonna work for all of them? Or do we need multiple vaccination? Or worse come to worse, we just need to ""live"" with COVID-19, i.e., adapt the new normal."
1369	112070	Like I said earlier... (TNXP) T-cell vaccine will bring back normal!!  Every human on earth already has there vaccine platform in their arm already and soon will have a cov19 one also
1370	110601	Good morning - As you may have heard, the first batch of the COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Los Angeles last night. This moment is a testament to the work of the scientists who made this possible, and to all those working logistics to get this vaccine to our frontline workers.
1371	111480	I’m not taking it. They can have my dose.I suggest the look into planned parenthood’s Margaret Sanger, Bill Gates Sr., Bill Gates before they take a vaccine. Personally I don’t want to play God.Some powerful people involved in vaccines, in their own words, do want to play God.
1372	112914	No ifs about it,  Would you take a punt on vaccine for a coronavirus that has been rushed through? The Molotov cocktail will be ready to go!!! Just the production to sort.Bill Gates is on record stating he wants population reduction. who does he think he is God?  @kbf
1373	108408	@OilersSpoilers @J_TheCynic Coronavirus is just a flu that’s a fact! Covid is different. Look it up. Fear of getting covid when you’ve got coronavirus is the concern. Vaccines aren’t coming anytime soon. They never even made one for COVID SARS
1374	109792	West Point is in my community. I am already taking every precaution I possibly can, but this decision made more places unsafe for longer. I can't go back to my therapist's office until there's a vaccine.
1375	111217	It's gonna get real ugly soon.  We will not be taking a vaccine for a virus with an extremely high recovery rate and effective treatments.
1376	111807	@NHSEngland I'd like to sign up for under 18 covid19 vaccine trials in North of England please can you give me info. I've raised over £2,000 with my painted pebbles for the NHS, am still going but also doing an outreach for the air ambulance having collected over 15,000 stamps.
1377	109080	The thing about anti vaxxers. They only hurt themselves and other antivaxxers, that is if the vaccine is effective. If, like the Flu Vaccines that have an efficacy rate of somewhere between 19 and 39% depending on the year, then even with the vaccine you can get COVID-19.
1378	108105	Should it be mandatory for healthcare workers to get the COVID-19 vaccine? What if they say no? We debate!

1380	201975	Alhamdullah received my first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine today! I am ready to finally find some normalcy in a year that has been filled with uncertainty and chaos. 🙏
1381	108317	When are people going to wake up and realise that this isn't about a deadly virus, it's about global control of the population. The vaccine itself is experimental (a trial) and we're the guinea-pigs. Bill Gates (Psychopath/Eugenicist) wants to cull the global population. Wake up.
1382	108174	"Totally serious question...Hypothetically, if 100% of the world got the COVID-19 injection, would the virus be eradicated?(As I understand it, the virus would just mutate seeing as the ""vaccines"" do not stop transmission. Am I wrong in my understanding?)"

1385	111811	@OneTrueShaun @AOC How would Medicare for all have prevented the Coronavirus pandemic or speeded up the vaccine process?
1386	111355	@beyerstein my prediction is that the road to a safe effective coronavirus vaccine is bumpy and the bumps in the road provide grist for the antivaxxers
1387	202405	@FTalleen @kgopinion My mother was born in the 3rd year of the Coronavirus pandemic called (falsely) Spanish Flu. She was 7 months old when her 24 yr old mother died of it.I am very grateful a vaccine has already appeared in the 1st yr of covid 19.It makes me patient for Aug
1388	110079	@GovAndyBeshear  @StevenStackMD  it the flu vaccine has not cured the flu then there is no vaccine that will cure c19.  Locking down will just kill us all.

1392	201814	Yesterday, it was nice to have a safe visit with my parents after being vaccinated. Go get vaccinated asap! There is no excuse not to, as the COVID-19 vaccine is readily available. I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot &amp; went to work the same day. No side effects. Science works!
1393	110017	@EvaRuth @linlewi1 @RobertTGarrett @travisfortexas @stevefortx @KVUE Why won't they take a vaccine which has emergency use authorization to prevent getting #COVID19?Why do they want to take Regeneron which has emergency use authorization to react to getting COVID19?Are they paying the higher cost out of pocket? #ThoughtSo
1394	112892	Good ....I hope she got the vaccine that makes you sterile...cause this world doesn’t need her offspring
1395	108452	@thehill Sure you will deliver a vaccine this year for the Coronavirus for the politicians and the Rick
1396	111731	After what happened with my annual flu jab this year - I'm sorry, but I don't have confidence in the Government or NHS to administer the Covid-19 vaccine on time, consistently and with the right priorities.Hopefully I'm wrong. Many people will be ok. But it's like a lottery
1397	202149	Hey @BillGates. Just to let you know, I’m having a Chicken and Leek Pie tonight and neither you or the vaccine I had this morning had any say on my decision making whatsoever. My main influence was that it was reduced in @marksandspencer... #CovidVaccine #COVID19
1398	109955	To anyone still dithering about whether or not to have the #COVID19 #vaccine, see below. I've come an awfully long way from initial scepticism and optimism when the pandemic first broke. Thought it would fizzle  quickly and vaccines wouldn't be needed. Boy, did I get it wrong!
1399	112762	people are complaining that a coronavirus vaccine ‘hasn’t been tested for long enough’ like there isn’t a new flu strain and vaccine produced each year that they will happily get
1400	110373	@SharylAttkisson If the COVID-19 vaccines work, then the vaccinated should be protected from the rest of us. If the vaccinated still contract the virus or any variant, then the vaccine doesn’t work, so why do they insist that we take it?
1401	110926	So the vaccine is good for 6 months,  AFTER 2 DOSES...so where does that put Canada? Since it could be 6 months to just, maybe get a second dose...#TrudeauFailedCanada #RemoveThePM
1402	108870	@JoelEdw85182292 @pitblackthorn @JAsakiewicz @disillusionedx @MsBlaireWhite Covid-19 already has some variations which makes the prospect of a potential vaccine more.. Complicated. Hopefully something gets figured out here soon though for I am just not sure if my sanity will hold up.
1403	108485	@AndrewBrandt True, but it also shows their ignorance of how the MRNA vaccines work...per their own inserts they do not prevent the transmission of #COVID19. They only work as an RRR not an ARR vaccine  which means they may reduce 1 or more symptoms when you get it.
1404	108657	"@JamarlinMartin Trump-lovers won't get the coronavirus vaccine because they ""don't know what's in it"" but will be first in line to get a McRib."
1405	111229	This guy is gonna make a trillion dollars off this vaccine and is definitely paying media to keep the fear mongering going until every one receives it
1406	108810	@Frances_Coppola You don't really need to take vaccines. A virus is dangerous only if you allow it to be. You just need to wear mask and follow the hygiene strictly (not because the Covid-19 is dangerous, but because you do not want to get infected)
1407	112789	If the coronavirus vaccine has nanites in it I'd like to volunteer to try it, I'm curious what the mind control aspect feels like.
1408	111218	Why are people in such an unseemly hurry to start dining out and drinking in closed bars and restaurants? The virus is not on a holiday. It may be wafting towards you from the,next table of laughing, chatting youngsters. Wait for the vaccine #covid19 #stayhome
1409	111570	Like a 7.. don’t know how life will ever go back to normal before a vaccine. I may be young but I have asthma and have had bouts of bronchitis. Worried about my mom and grandma.. the fact that you can be asymptomatic is just 🤯. Also read that it’s causing miscarriages sooo. 7.
1410	109922	@PointCounterpt @marsha_vivinate I have a lot of symptoms of COVID-19 so going to take a test before I get the vaccine just to be safe. I don’t think it’s COVID. I think I just never got rid f my bronchitis.
1411	112263	Getting ready to delegate all my COVID-19 masks to an huge bonfire. Get the vaccine, and let's bring good times back by tossing all the f--king idiots that want to still wear these disguises to manipulate the rest of us in an huge dumpster with the rest of the trash!
1412	109058	We need a global #vaccination effort or the pandemic will never end, and with new mutations of #Covid all it takes is for 1 variant to become resistant to vaccines and treatments to keep the virus a constant threat to all the people in the world.
1413	111245	Coronavirus is fucking up the entire world, but some how niggas think the vaccine is a conspiracy to take them out? Lmaoooo
1414	109223	@nytimes If the study that states after getting the coronavirus you have immunity for only 3 months, wouldn’t a vaccine also protect you for only 3 months?
1415	111008	@Chriswb71 @elle91 I don't care either way because if no vaccine is found what then occurs?Death rate of regular Flu goes down and Covid19 stays on actuarial charts which will go down as well but not enough to equal. It burns itself out and pops up occasionally.Like H1N1.
1416	110566	Isnt that illegal?If not,WHY?WE'RE IN A PANDEMIC FOR PETE'S SAKE! I WANT THINGS AS NORMAL AS POSSIBLE..this is why things can't get better, people like that! The hypocrites are getting the vaccine on the low low or in their back yards but telling the uninformed don't get it! Ughh
1417	110448	@Cast45J Oh good grief. There’s no vaccine for coronavirus, have you not been paying attention? So being “unvaccinated” (or frankly an illegal alien) has nothing to do with anything.

1422	108762	@onekade The coronavirus vaccine likewise is designed to protect the vaccinated person from the coronavirus to a certain degree, in the event that the person catches the coronavirus. This is why emphasizing the protective qualities of vaccines is so important.
1423	108365	Sooner or later people will twig, the virus is still out there with no vaccine and no anti-viral remedy! What are we going to do then?

1426	110227	@BillBlair @JustinTrudeau @MBGov @redcrosscanada We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.

1430	202444	"Not only did this information circulate MONTHS before vaccines were be distributed, but the pharmacist that gave me my first dose told me exactly this. ""Flu like"" symptoms are expected after your second dose. This is insignificant compared to actual COVID19 symptoms."

1433	111186	@TTolman @ForecasterEnten It's a coronavirus, and we know from experience that human immunity to coronaviruses is 1-2 years. The end game is most likely you get your annual coronavirus shot just like the flu vaccine.

1435	108865	@elonmusk So did @elonmusk get the vaccine for Covid19 and if not will he ever get the Covid19 vaccine or just wait for herd immunity?
1436	112536	@SkyNews Correction: virtually everyone is going to get coronavirus, regardless of age or vaccination status. Whitty has already said this. It is now endemic and we'll all catch it if we haven't already - vaccines mitigate symptoms, but don't stop spread. It's not just about children
1437	111270	My favorite part about @trading212 is that when important events happen such as a Coronavirus vaccine being found, their platform and servers completely freeze and you can't buy or sell anything. I absolutely love it, would recommend to anyone.
1438	110341	If you really believed vaccines don’t work, you wouldn’t have to sabotage them in order to “prove” your point.... if they don’t work, they would just not-work on their own. All this proves is that you are a malicious asshole

1443	110195	Even if this can be resolved, how many people will refuse to take the #COVID19vaccine (if one is actually found and approved) thus rendering it useless? And they will be right not to take it given the risks of #COVID19 to anyone under 70 is near 0.00%.

1447	111933	@IreneSans Yes I heard that. Also virtual NWA in September. I am not traveling without a vaccine (and I also did a report on how we manage tornadoes alongside COVID-19 - I will submit the abstract in August once I get the reviewed version done).
1448	111119	Cause they had/have a govt that doesn't give a damn-why ya think they are again or on constant lock down? Hey how days in a row with ZERO deaths? Unless they have a secret vaccine-wouldn't put that past the CCP since they created it! whoops-fake news-could never happen! Right?
1449	111252	I'm wearing a double mask for another yr. And disposable gloves. Covid can stay on metal surfaces for 7 days, so disposable gloves as well. My immune system probably couldn't withstand the vaccine.  I've been inside, except for the mailbox. And I alcohol all my mail. ♥️🌎🐻🐝

1475	111609	@CurtisHouck @tedcruz The vaccine only covers the person who received it from getting really seriously ill of the Coronavirus.  You can still get the virus.  Just like 5800 people who got the virus after they received the vaccine. Wear a mask.    But you can't fix stupid, like Ted Cruz.

1492	112395	@V_4_Vendatta Sadly this is true. We see the vaccine injured patients in the hospitals everyday. The “vaccine” for covid19 is absolutely going to be a lethal injection to the immune system.

1494	112001	Good news for once: 17 March 00:30 GMT — First vaccine clinical trials begin in the United States. The first phase I clinical trial for a potential COVID-19 vaccine has begun in Seattle, Washington.
1495	110604	This is really the good news that we've all been waiting for re the vaccine. Not only will we be better protected, but there's less risk we'll be harming others.
1496	112670	So, 6% of the US has contracted covid-19 so far.On those figures they'll reach herd immunity at between 3.5M to 4.6M death. How much they can cut this figure all depends on how fast the vaccine roll outs go. Scary.
1497	202301	Today,I received my first COVID-19 Vaccine Stab @cvspharmacy! So grateful for those administering this valuable vaccine. Praying in Jesus’ name 4 an end to this pandemic. 2nd Vaccine stab is scheduled...#modernavaccine #painless #partlyvaccinated #StayHealthy #EndThePandemic https://t.co/U8QqarrG7m
1498	109583	You have comes as good supporting actor in covid-19 film😄there is no doubt about itIndia is with Modiji and always will be.GDP??? China??? Vaccine Progress?
1499	110881	@GameSetMatch000 @shaw_2_raw @imdaniel00 But for the flu jab, they are guessing. They have to predict mutations/strains. With coronavirus, we literally know the exact virus. There's no excuse for such a low effective rate when you have all the info.
1500	111468	Anybody who thinks these Pharmaceutical companies working on a vaccine for the virus will give it to other countries for free need their head examined they wont be giving it to the NHS for free either
1501	112442	@BrianT2112 @ann_resists @thedailybeast Herd immunity means 30% of population will die  Get Vaccine Covid19 is survivable hower 85% of unvaccinated patients are dieing please get the Vaccine
1502	202136	I’m confused. Am I now chipped with a tracking device with this #CovidVaccine or is my DNA being altered? These Qnuts, say all this while still insisting we thank the #FormerGuy for the vaccine they won’t get. Yup, right on top of that. 🙄#COVID #COVID19 #vaccine #vaccinated
1503	202325	This #fucker got the vaccine &amp; his boss said it was a damn hoax. I actually work in nursing homes and I dont when I'm gonna get it. #GOPBetrayedAmerica #HypocriteRubio
1504	111228	This is what happens when you ignore the pandemic and pretend that everything is going to be okay and tell people not to get the vaccine. This is the end result of science misinformation. How sad
1505	109919	my fam is now currently in its second covid-19 breakout since the pandemic started... the first time was because there were no vaccines out... this time it’s because my brother decided he was immune and didn’t need the vaccine... he just scheduled his first dose
1506	111391	Okay so they’re telling the unvaccinated to get #COVID19 vaccine because ‘it works’But telling the vaccinated to get a  #BoosterJab because because the vaccine doesn’t work MAKE IT MAKE SENCE
1507	110963	My mom &amp; others apparently believe that #COVID19 was weaponized by China. They believe that #Fauci is being paid to push the vaccines because it's big money &amp; not actually beneficial. They want no vaccine, no masks &amp; everything as it was before. What is going on in the world?
1508	112700	@GovLarryHogan @MdPublicSchools - A March 1st reopening goal is not realistic. We need to have all teachers and staff get a second dose of the vaccine and two weeks to develop immunity. There just aren't enough vaccines yet.
1509	111262	Vaccine won’t“get rid of”virus.”Might”lessen symptoms if u get Covid.”Might”protect you from getting it 2some”unknown degree”4”unknown”period.No studies on longterm side effects.NO ONE has a right 2try 2invade my body/risk my health w/a foreign substance w/threats 2my freedoms!
1510	108205	SAFE is the key word. Just like suggesting Black and Brown and low-income kids should return to school first, they're gonna try to make Black/Brown folx the guinea pigs for this vaccine. Not having it. Go head start in the burbs.
1511	108287	The Chinese Communist Party has publicly condemned Japan's decision to provide the coronavirus vaccine to Taiwan.  We will never forgive the Chinese Communist Party to interfere with vaccine support to Taiwan.#TaiwanCheering

1513	112684	@AuthenticVegas @NPR One improvement would be those instant tests they say exist but are not approved by the FDA.But a vaccine is the only real answer at this point.Better hope it happens fast, Denmark is euthanizing all mink due to a mutated coronavirus spreading back to humans.
1514	108685	I'm not an anti vaxxer I have had 2 doses of AZ, but I have my concerns about giving a healthy child a coronavirus jab. My 2 will certainly not be getting it anytime soon!
1515	111977	@badassday More political shenanigans?- #coronavirus in flu strain since 2003 (Glasgow University keeps records for annual flu)- #COVIDー19 is this epidemic- Tests are for #coronavirus- New vaccine will be for #coronavirusNOTE: All MSM &amp; politicians now call it #coronavirus🤔
1516	107788	I guess they can't justify going in to test their vaccine in Africa, what will they do?.. Btw, this is an insulting headline, this is what racism looks like. Everywhere else containment is key. In Africa it's poverty, really???
1517	109694	"@MarketsCafe If you get the COVID-19 vaccine, you can't donate blood or plasma ""because it's completely tainted."""
1518	108191	@petemorristwit If you're particularly at risk from Covid-19 it may make sense for you to take a vaccine, but if you're not then there's no need to bother.
1519	108741	@RealLimerickMan @MaryFusillo @chadloder @thepacketrat Flue season last for but a few months in the colder times, it also has a vaccine (that alot of Americans don't take then wonder why they have the highest deaths from flu) Covid-19 does not and is world wide in different climates killing thousands at a time, you heartless mf
1520	109481	There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. Wash hand frequently with sanitizers. #FightCovid19
1521	108040	We tolerate mediocrity. If other countries would like to have world class vaccines with efficacy rate of 95 % ( Pfizer and Moderna )  , then we set up ourselves to have mediocre immune response. Still, 50 percent sounds like a far cry from 95 percent.
1522	111196	@RexKwasiDanquah Covid19 vaccine is not even a vaccine,the yellow fever has stood the test of time, there's adequate research on the effects and also it has proven to be effective on like the virus which had not yet been fully understood, don't compare the two
1523	202258	Yes it is a great achievement and I am pleased that I had my first jab today. All we need now is good leadership to make sure we exit lockdown following the science and data and don’t let the virus get a grip and chance to mutate.
1524	109203	@Confidence101 @LesStonehouse There is no Coronavirus vaccine yet... hopefully soon. It will save hundreds if not thousands of lives.
1525	107980	@VonWedekind what do you think about this coronavirus? are we going to have a vaccine? are we going to get out of quarantine, ever?
1526	110655	"She is a beautiful soul. All this dying is so sad. Those who think it's a hoax, should not be allowed to get medical treatment for Covid or the vaccine...after all it is just a ""HOAX""."
1527	202053	Why are you so late it should have been mandatory vaccinations from day 1 of the Vaccines. I had first dose months ago of Astragenica the second was in July.
1528	107985	No one‘s going back to school for 2 years. It just can’t happen. Not till we have a vaccine &amp; mass production of that vaccine. Not just testing! Because people who’ve already had COVID-19 are getting reinfected in China. So we don’t necessarily get immunity.V sad scary times
1529	111515	This is the only sensible choice, otherwise we'll continue to get small pockets of outbreaks indefinitely until we get a vaccine. If we get a vaccine
1530	111190	@CurlyDreads I also personally don’t get the flu vaccine however coronavirus is much more serious than the flu in that it can have long term health effects. I would never want to be the guy who gets it and is fine but passes it on to another young healthy person who then develops lung issues.
1531	109337	If you’ve been reading pseudoscience about COVID-19 vaccines, please reconsider. If you are uncomfortable about getting a COVID-19 vaccine, please reconsider. Someone in my family just died from COVID. They were fully vaccinated.Enough is enough.#COVID19
1532	108806	'..a conservative pastor named Curt Landry has warned his followers never to accept an eventual vaccination for the coronavirus. “That vaccine is from the pit of Hell,” Landry said. “Do not pray for those vaccines, and do not take the vaccine.” '
1533	110606	Is this the only medical condition you use to openly discriminate against potential customers? If I have a cold, the flu, chicken pox, strep throat, or measles can I come in? What if I have a positive covid test but don't tell you &amp; just flash a vaccine card, we good then?
1534	109750	@GilbertsBlake And when a #Vaccine is made I will say No Thank You bc I don't need or want the #CoronaVirus #Mercury #Aluminum #Formaldehyde &amp; other Poisons in my body. #BiologicalWarfare has arrived Again.
1535	111077	A new study suggests?We’ve been saying this for 2 years. Good job you have out free donuts for the vaccine and closed all the gyms though eh?
1536	108532	@jt_hoopdreams11 I believe we need a vaccine before we can consider going back to normal. It appears the young folks are the Carrie's that are taking COVID-19 back home to their parents/grandparents.. Just my Opinion though..
1537	109668	Why covid vaccine would be free for Bihar only. Does Bihar got and special status as Kashmir got in past??Isn't Bihar equal to other states or is it vote bank game?
1538	111085	Just think of it this way:Prime #Loki is the CoronavirusHis Variants are toxic mutationsThe TVA is the vaccineWe do not want the variants spreading.Get vaccinated!
1539	111260	I hope with this surge Nigerians that  said they've formulated a cure will be given audience to prove their claim. If we are going to keep waiting for only the white man to formulate a vaccine then to God be the glory.
1540	112727	@11thHour You guys are pushing that vaccine coming out before Election Day when we know how long it typically takes for a vaccine to get approved! That and keeping sports going in spite of players getting the coronavirus! You are becoming state run media just like Fox News!
1541	202160	Got my 2nd dose of Covid-19 Vaccine today. Fully vaccinated ❤️ #COVID19Vaccination #Sinovac https://t.co/Na2H5gb1LS
1542	109986	It's his job to keep pushing the fear, he is cashing in on the vaccine when it comes and he needs us to believe that is the  only cure. However, he is wrong, if this virus came from the lab it will lose it's deadliness, also therapies are working around the world. #novaccine
1543	112178	@GeorgeTakei I dont care what I would ever read online. To think taking a horse dewormer would be more succesful than a vaccine, I encourage you to take it then. You know coronavirus isnt a worm right? Its like taking a laxitive to get ride of cancer.
1544	111992	@MimiJ9 @SebastienneL Don't be fooled.The masons,the Illuminati,others will take only the Flu vaccine twice. The humans,the targeted individuals,the poor,the useless eaters will be for some shot twice with the covid-19 vaccines or the luckiest one Flu and one covid vaccine.All to reduce the population
1545	202323	Today marks the rollout of the second Covid-19 vaccine. Brian Pinker, a patient at Churchill hospital on dialysis for kidney disease, was the first to receive the jab this morning.Are you booked in to have yours yet?https://t.co/qTv99yUJzW
1546	202188	WDH has reported administering about 83 percent of the first dose of COVID-19 vaccines and nearly 32 percent of the second dose. #COVID19WY

1548	109938	#i keep why Americans can't a drug/vaccines for the covid-19 while china has already take care of their citizens are that victims of coronavirus and ,they are back to work
1549	109150	Violating protocols is going to a party or not having a mask on. Homeboy submitted a fake vaccine card
1550	109894	I won’t be getting the COVID-19 vaccine until there are credible studies regarding the long term side effects. If it works, the people who get the vaccine shouldn’t be worried about us who don’t get it going about our normal, daily lives.
1551	108443	I can be able to get vaccine to cure this Coronavirus base on my knowledge on virology but the goverment will never support me  #coronavirus
1552	109085	@_Stetters @HogsHaven It's about as experimental as any flu shot. They've been making Coronavirus vaccines for decades. And with people actually believing there's microchips and mutant powers in the vaccine, it's easy to see why the govt would incentivize it
1553	108603	@MichiganOnBTN @Ronnieb_8 @DavidOjabo @emilyehman @UMichFootball I think this is the right time to invest especially now that coronavirus making our job and economic slow down. Why not try  @tyron_robert7  platform out with €1,000 to earn €4,200
1554	107833	This is completely nuts…..The vaccine is still emergency use only. It is not approved by the FDA in the US. Studies are showing that it does not stop the spread of Covid.
1555	108015	Tbh all those refusing to take the vaccine pls go out and lick the ground so u can speed up the process and we’ll have less uneducated ppl in the world ❤️ #COVIDIOTS #vicroadmap #DanAndrews #COVID19
1556	111223	@MikeJWake @JuliaHB1 There is not going to be a vaccine for this strain, we will have to live with COVID-19 as we do all the others &amp; of course the issue you have missed is, what happens if the virus mutates vin the next 12 months, do we stay locked down for ever?
1557	111696	snorting cocaine off a toilet seat at the weekend and refusing to have a coronavirus vaccine because “you don’t know what’s in it”GET IN THE BIN.

1559	112704	just got my second jab. phone rang and it was gladys. she told me the novel coronavirus is “not my problem” then the nurse handed me a “roadie” to take to “the pub”. rate it 👍🏼
1560	110247	@mtgreenee You are forcing people to get the Coronavirus &amp; the Variants that is being spreading all over the place. There is 1 party to be blamed for this. The Republican party. #Covid19 would have never killed anyone without Trump's supporters being too chicken to get the vaccine.
1561	112849	When do the delivery peeps or retail workers get there’s? Food workers? 100% whoever delivered those vaccines doesn’t get a vaccine.
1562	110706	@MissBeck12 @GovAndyBeshear People who recover from COVID-19 develop antibodies for only a certain amount of time and can get COVID-19 again within a few months. It has happened in my family before.The vaccines set to stop you from getting it again. That’s what vaccines do.
1563	111182	Or perhaps it's because the government, the doctors and the media spread fear. Telling you that you must get the vaccine and then saying you're still not safe. Start there. Fortunately, half the country is on to you.
1564	202088	My parents received the first dose of the Pfizer #COVID19 vaccine a few minutes ago at the @ArmoryNYC, thank you @nyphospital for ensuring such a smooth process. 🙌🏽🙌🏽CC: @jabcommunity &amp; @MariaALuna https://t.co/klAonKkBFG
1565	109312	I can’t. “I’ve never had a flu shot, and never had the flu...but I’m perfectly willing to inject a rushed vaccine for a disease I’ll probably never get.”How stupid are you?
1566	109552	@hedgehogkibble @TeresaABacon2 @WINDOCTORRX @PrezTeamtrump Then how come vaccinated peopl are getting COVID-19 if the vaccine is so damn good.
1567	110181	You’d think this would be the main news story 🤷‍♂️..... instead more scare tactics about an Indian variant that the vaccine covers 🤦🏼‍♂️. We couldn’t have a world where the main news outlets share too much positivity though could we 🖕🏻
1568	111813	"Es gratis, no se quejen: ""How effective is AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine? We still don't have a clear, consistent answer. Some peer-reviewed, others not — have suggested the vaccine could be anywhere from 22% to 90% effective"" Business Insider @pauletta_sofia @Rodpac @rivapa"
1569	108232	There it is People that don't want a rushed through vaccine THAT could cause more trouble in the long run will be forced to stay at home.  When they state compulsion to that makes me want to say NO ANYWAY for the hell of it. What happens if you've got a boinked immune system ?
1570	108837	To be fair , Pfizer did not come up with this vaccine on their on . It was in collaboration with Biontech a Germany Bio company . Again I repeat, the Trump admin was not involved in any way financially. Again the vaccine still has to go through final clinical stages for approval
1571	110556	Since I am 82 and do not have suicidal tendencies, l eagerly took the Coronavirus vaccine. With the vaccine, if I unfortunately get infected, my chance of survival is enhanced. It’s a “no brainer”
1572	111890	If it don’t make me money, happy or better I don’t want it! Or the Covid-19 vaccine I don’t want it..😂
1573	111283	@BlueR00n There was a vaccine for it- my parents are smart and my school district responsible. No. No that is why I did not get measles. Let’s all be SMART and when the Covid19 vaccinations are available- GET IT.

1577	110019	@NYCMayor I got tested positive last week to #COVID19 - when I asked my doctor for a monoclonal antibody he refused because im not 65 y/o or fat - why is it that there's so much vaccines out there but when someone is sick with 104.6 fever and all symptoms he get refued treatment?
1578	108051	Then ofcourse they're sayng there's a new strain of the coronavirus so they'll be giving a vaccine every year like they do for the flu. They take last year's virus strain and explain to you why the vaccine may not work... bye yo....
1579	112645	Will COVID-19 disappear if we isolate for weeks or months? If it started with 1 person, will it be eradicated by isolation. I doubt anyone is ready for forced quarantines. There won’t be a vaccine soon, if at all. If humans cope thru herd immunity, how do we get there from here?
1580	201828	I received my 2nd COVID-19 vaccine today. I’m fully vaccinated now. I plan to still wear my mask to comply with @OHdeptofhealth recommendation. @GreenswellCraig
1581	110953	The WHO is corrupt and in Gates back pocket. I for one will never take this vaccine. Rushed through, unsafe and no rights to sue if any danderous side effects. #Trumpisright

1583	111382	This doesn't mean a vaccine is around the corner, of even that it will be here in 2020. But it is very good news.

1585	111212	@Jim_Jordan Love ya, @Jim_Jordan but we can’t “beat” COVID-19 the way we’re trying. Stop with the vaccines and the testing. The virus is here to stay, but will get weaker if we stop these useless vaccines
1586	112810	imagine there's a bug with the twitter app. your friends' apps are crashing but the president says the bug doesn't exist, so you believe him. why then, would you download update as soon as it's released?definitely not talking about trump supporters and the coronavirus vaccine
1587	112035	Given all this great news, I would think everyone in Armenia, would have been inoculated with this Armenian founder company’s vaccine. Is that too much to ask? Wishful thinking?

1590	202435	The persecution narrative of white evangelicals about COVID19 precautions (masks, distancing, closings, stay home orders, vaccines) feels a lot like “I get to participate in the persecution for my faith just like foreign believers in repressive regimes, look at MEEEEE!!!!”
1591	110928	Then we wonder why new #COVID19 variants keep coming!!No one is safe until everyone is safe!!We are paying for “Vaccine Inequity” towards the low-income countries!!#VaccineInequity #Omicron #covidvariant

1593	112879	@typzk @stevjo9 @EvanLSolomon Medication is also a personal choiceWe do take Vaccines for ourselves so we don't get the disease the Vaccine is forThe COVID19 Vaccine is not a real Vaccine since it does not actually vaccinate.  The so called Vaccine does not prevent one from getting the disease at all
1594	108938	@startelegram Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
1595	201873	They also wouldn't let me register for spring classes my freshman year until I got the chicken pox vaccine so this isn't really that new(I thought I'd already gotten it but I had not)
1596	110225	I’m all for a coronavirus vaccine, however I’m gonna wait after it’s been out a while to make sure it’s safe and I don’t end up growing like 4 arms or something
1597	108427	@lufook @mikegruber @Sulaco22 @secretfakename @Travis_in_Flint It can't be because they are attempting to eradicate a coronavirus with a gene therapy. There has never been a successful vaccine against a coronavirus. It's like the flu including the Spanish flu. It doesn't go away. It continuously mutates into new strains
1598	108917	My mom who is a nurse in a nursing home and also has an autoimmune disease told me that she is scheduled for her Covid-19 vaccine and I am so relieved. I’ve spent the last 9 months worrying about her being exposed and I finally feel like I can relax

1600	111353	So doctors are getting indemnified to administer a vaccine AZ, that our political classes are forcing us to get &amp; telling us is safe.Madness. Utter lunacy. #coronavirus#COVID19
1601	111634	It’s been a great joy to watching so many frontline healthcare providers in Florida get the vaccine this week.I hope custodial staff like William Wyatt are being prioritized too. Facilities can’t function without them.

1604	110394	Covid-19 knows vaccines are starting to limit its chances of killing the elderly so is it desperately mutating in hope of finding the strain that beats the vaccine, this virus is either very smart or China is using 5G to communicate directly with it

1614	110320	A little confused about this one. Is this a low number when it comes to mass vaccines. I don’t like how Ford has handled this rollout but I hope we only criticize when due. If you are an expert on mass vaccine would like to know expectations.
1615	108271	@Rachelhouda @kurteichenwald @RealCandaceO What about people who get the coronavirus and get over it? How do they compare to those who get vaccinated? Will the vaccine that doesn't exist yet be proof against the disease? What % of immune deficient persons are incapable of getting vaccinated? What do they do about strep?
1616	109287	Everyone bitching about a vaccine for coronavirus is awfully ironic since America has been indoctrinated with all this antivax bullshit, so half of y’all wouldn’t even get a vaccine anyways and we would STILL be screwed sooooo #WASH #YOUR #HANDS
1617	108143	It's good to push back on misinformation regarding the pandemic, even if it's family. #coronavirus  #COVIDー19  #CoronavirusVaccine  #CoronaVaccine  #CoronavirusPandemic
1618	111173	Also I know it’s tough but if someone you know gets the coronavirus vaccine please don’t immediately make them feel guilty for getting it before you/your mom/your partner/etc. There is limited supply and huge demand. I didn’t choose when I got it, the state did
1619	108475	"@D_Kuehn Covid-19 will return to Denmark and other countries where it is ""under control"". It is a matter of time. We cannot eradicate this. Only a vaccine or some form of herd immunity can do that.Americans need to stop the hysteria. Life has to go on. It is not presently."
1620	108939	@Mmfchick @CarsonJaymes @Breaking911 I do believe in the flu vaccine.  I get one every year and it’s helped me from getting the flu since I work in a hospital.  Most people who don’t get the flu shot will be lining up for this coronavirus vaccine when it’s available.
1621	108832	@PAULEGWILSON @ReformRambo Wonder how much their selling Covid-19 for in this shop...or is it 2 vaccines and get the 3rd free 🙄#Lunacy
1622	110480	@mbradhoo @GovofCO So if it slows the rates why are the rates up so much?The healthcare system has never had a coronavirus issue in many years, they have a staffing issue!! Exactly, so why is only the unvaxxed getting tested when the vax’d can easily be a host and spread it? Many case in points
1623	111777	Over 100 million Americans have now received the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. We're making good progress - keep it up! (I get my 2nd shot in about 1 1/2 weeks) #GetVaccinated #ThisIsOurShot

1626	111517	This has been something I've been curious about.... is this vaccine that's currently being rolled out going to be effective against this new variant or any other which we may still have to experience?
1627	112929	Starting to get VERY high marks in our handling of the Coronavirus (China Virus), especially when compared to other countries and areas of the world. Now the Vaccines (Plus) are coming, and fast!
1628	111170	Breaking news.  Just as predicted, @covid mutating and vaccines may be ineffective. NO vaccine for a @coronavirus has ever been effective. Just like flu virus, it is constantly mutatinghttps://t.co/0fruduG8n6
1629	202144	Had my second Covid-19 vaccination yesterday. Feel absolutely fine today. Many thanks to all involved in the vaccine rollout. You may just have saved the world!#takethevaccine
1630	108291	@jojojojoos @avux99 @AuthenticallyAL @kezjacko @meepeedee @AstraZeneca I'm so sorry and I hope you get well soon. Could you please tell me if you were tested for covid-19 after the AstraZeneca vaccine?
1631	108620	This is quite tone deaf. If the last year hasn't already had my wife and I both considering leaving Emergency Medicine, a vaccine mandate will likely seal the deal. Staffing shortages will certainly compound with this foolishness.
1632	108448	@TomJChicago President Trump didn’t lie about a vaccine. They’re are cures already out there. Coronavirus’s are multiple. We’ve had 6 deaths in USA. But we’ve ad 40000 deaths this year in USA for another strain of flu that did have the flu shot.  So if this is also manufactured then...
1633	108302	If you are in my state of California, Governor Newsom has announced that distribution could possibly start as early as tomorrow. Will you be taking the Wuhan / Covid-19 Vaccine when the time comes?

1636	110345	Why are we the ones always crying against everything? When will this change? No one owes us a vaccine, ma @MaEllenSirleaf. We must learn to produce our own. There is nothing global about a national innovation. Produce yours. Statements like these only shows how entitled we are.
1637	107949	If @realDonaldTrump is involved in any way, shape or form with the Vaccine, I will NOT take it.  #COVID19 #vaccine #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaVaccine #CovidVaccine #Covid_19 #COVID
1638	111854	@ATabarrok No herd immunity, coz it's a fast mutating coronavirus.  But T cell and natural immunity in play, like for the flu where not everybody who's exposed gets it.It also means VACCINES ARE A SCAMMY APPROACH. Vaccines have not eradicated the flu nor is it proven they reduce cases.

1641	112542	Bill and Melinda. When are they and their children having the vaccine.   They don’t believe in vaccines at all for their children I read somewhere. Is this true??
1642	109400	@ScottyShaps1 Is @DanaBashCNN still praising his pivot? He's done this countless times but next he behaves like a normal person, he'll praised like he found a vaccine for Covid-19 and Ebola.
1643	112710	Vaccine development normally takes years, if not decades. But scientific teams around the world are aiming to develop a COVID-19 vaccine in 12 to 18 months.......let’s hope we never see Bill Gates vaccines, we do not need any mercury in our bodies!!!
1644	111808	⬇️ is a reply to my pointing out that Biden was against the #COVID19 vaccine he now takes credit for. Doodie Giuliani is what happens when you eat paint chips. Don't be like Doodie Giuliani.
1645	112571	@fazzyfocus 2/2 can not go out, or the people that feel vaccines are bad, are they thinking of they other people that they affect? This may sound bad but let them go out and get coronavirus maybe they will change their mind.

1650	109831	This is false. The University System of Georgia is absolutely NOT doing everything it can. A COVID vaccine should be required for in-person classes or to live in student housing just like it requires for other diseases.
1651	111160	"""If antibodies can fade in some patients within weeks, and if just about everyone loses them after a few months, that would render any vaccine almost completely useless."""

1655	112796	@destini92664 Can someone please tell me where in the fuck we have ever created an effective vaccine for ANY #coronavirus? The answer is we haven't because they mutate too fast. The only long term solution is #NaturalImmunity.
1656	110594	Instead of offering those who have survived #COVID19 a vaccine they should be offered an anti-body test. If their levels equal what a vaccine would provide, they should not be inoculated until/unless their anti-body levels drop below what a vaccine would provide, no?
1657	111486	The @WHO declared thr coronavirus a pandemic, we need to put all resources on vaccine research asap, this is no longer politics.
1658	109011	@NeilMackay Neil, Do you know what a Coronavirus does when it encounters a Vaccine, IT MUTATES. Even IF everyone in the World was Vaxed, it would Mutate &amp; just continue on. YOU Can Not Stop a Coronavirus no matter how much you try.  Dont believe me, ask its cousin the FLU.

1660	108183	Sounds like BS to me, too, but I'm curious: Has this been observed with other vaccines? If it has been, even once, it's worth considering; if it's never been observed, I think we can relegate the claim to the BS department.
1661	111891	"I asked my doctor if I was eligible (yes on some resources, no on others??) for the vaccine, and if so, how could I get it. When I apologized for being confused about the process, and he said ""it's just as confusing for healthcare providers. I don't know, I'll try to find out."""

1665	110072	@JaneCaro And the flu vaccine is changed every year as will the COVID vaccines. Coronavirus Ez are tricky bloody things and it’s a vaccine race to keep up with them
1666	112431	Conversely, the Covid-19 vaccines have been headline news every day since May last year. Every person in the world has heard of them, and nearly half the planet has had one
1667	201805	Privileged to have received my second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine earlier today. All who are able to do so safely, must get their shot ASAP - to protect self and our nation.And remember, #ScreenB4Vaccine - especially if U R over 65 with CV disease. https://t.co/D3Ga0e1kh8

1676	109622	For the immunologists out there.If a person has had COVID19 what benefit is there in taking a vaccine?Are there any enhanced risks in vaccination of a previously infected person?I'm asking because I genuinely have no idea.
1677	108623	It seems Europeans are the main culprits spreading it, luckily Cuba has a good healthcare system and I'd probably bet they would have a big influence on creating a vaccine in the near future
1678	109725	@DaneHoelting @AriIaccarino @ChandlerIsOkay @shawtyknowz @Primrxze1 @slightworkkk_ And even that is not proven. imagine if someone never caught covid-19 before getting vaxxed and then they get it after the fact, there is no way they can confirm that their symptoms would have been less severe if they didn’t get vaxxed. Covid-19 itself has a 99,6% survival rate.
1679	108686	@simondolan This is the agenda, vaccinate everyone, the test cannot differentiate from the common cold, the flu and covid-19 or any other virus. Crisis management rule 1 - don’t panic the people. They want you to panic so you get the vaccine, they want this to implode

1687	111792	@wgang1616 Everyone will get COVID19, it is not going to go away unless alternative medicine is used.  The vaccine does not stop you from getting or transmitting it.

1689	109689	Nah this ppl psycho. Just get the damn vaccine. All it does is give your body coding to the virus so that it can recognize it and fight it off before you get extremely sick or hospitalized and in time once everyone gets it, prevent it from mutating and eventually eradicated

1729	108544	@jimcramer Suppose we had a vaccine tomorrow for the coronavirus. How many people would get the shot. I believe it would be similar to the flu shot. Many people will not get it because they believe it causes them to get the flu.  Military no choice, you get the shot.

1732	110010	@carlosex I am not sure Fauci is right.  For an 80-yr old male, the #COVID19 CFR is 15% before the vaccine; after the vaccine, it is still 0.75% for a 95% effective vaccine - safer but not zero.
1733	111648	@VikiLovesFACS I'm curious if anyone sees changes after a COVID19 infection. If there is a correlation with the vaccine it would be good to know if the infection has the same finding.
1734	111996	The only 100% guaranteed vaccine for the Coronavirus is the November election. Five minutes after Trump is reelected the Covid-19 will totally disappear.
1735	201886	How y'all doing today, just got her COVID-19 vaccine card bout to hit the mail with it and mail em , if y'all think everything is a scam just drop in my dm for my snap let's get the process started https://t.co/OaZyTIFL8f
1736	201830	Took 2'nd dose of COVID-19 Vaccine at APHC Asalatnagar ( Ghaziabad ).it took me less than 1 minute to get vaccinated. Heartily Thanks to 🙏🏻 PM @narendramodiji and CM @myogiadityanath ji.Thank you @AjitpaltyagiMLA ji , @Gen_VKSingh ji and @dm_ghaziabad sir for the arrangements.
1737	108911	@InformedNJNurse It's time to realize nothing can stop the spread of an airborne virus. No vaccine, no mask, no pill.  If that was the case the common cold, which is a coronavirus, would not exist anymore. Time to be real and return to normal life. People will get sick it's human nature.
1738	112744	Not surprised, but still so very angry! 😡😡😡 How many more people will die in the time it takes to fix this? As a high risk disabled person, I still can’t get a vaccine. American exceptionalism at work 🤦‍♀️
1739	108653	@candbab99 @MybrotherSshot @Skywatcher1600 @Bill43111 @atrupar Sorry for my typo but thanks for the comments. Very petty. No Covid19 is not a scam and yes I will be getting the vaccine whenever it becomes available.
1740	111733	@colonelflusterd @7teen_76 @kimKBaltimore Sorry but they are. From the EUA “the Pzifer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is an unapproved vaccine” “still being studied in clinical trials”. Everyone getting the jab is in a phase of the clinical trial
1741	109515	“I am proud that Qatar is among the first countries in the world to provide a safe, effective and approved COVID-19 vaccine for its population. This safe and effective vaccine has passed all trials and been approved by the European Union's medicines regulator,
1742	111279	#NZ will get in under control. Their PM is doing a fantastic job, along with their govt officials. It stinks they’re back into #lockdown but I’m sure all of us would love to have a 100 days on, 30 days off model. That’s as close to normal as it will get before a vaccine. #COVID19
1743	110092	@J4LYN @theCULTiE People in England I’ve talked to say this vaccine/these vaccines raises immunity as in it’s not a 100% guarantee of not getting Covid-19...&amp; it’s worth it cuz it/they raise immunity. And they’re fine w/the Covid-19 vaccine passport, cuz there’s vaccine passports already.. 🙄🤦‍♀️
1744	201838	Since I took Covid-19 vaccine I had bad side effect late at night my body temperature dropped I had to wear jumper socks to warm up for few hours I was shivering but did not have fever but today my body i do not feel right feel tired not able to do activities
1745	108426	@CBarnesPT @daniel_kraft @WSJ @RanBalicer @ClalitHealth I don't know. I commend their aggressive Covid19 vaccine rollouts. But they should not leave out Palestinians this pandemic is impacting everyone around the world especially the most vulnerable.
1746	108384	12/20 Carlson ranted about the COVID-19 vaccinations. “They are planning to force you to take the coronavirus vaccine. It’s so safe, they have to threaten you to take it,” he falsely claimed (there are no current government plans to force COVID vaccines, or any other vaccinations
1747	108885	a covid-19 vaccine has been announced and everyone wants to bash the president. This is potentially a huge step in getting our lives back to normal, but people are to bitter to let go even in victory.
1748	202085	Got my first Pfizer jab Feb 23.  Deltoid was a little sore for a day or so.  Experienced no other side effects except felt a little fatigued that night, next day.
1749	111709	Fantastic news that another Covid19 vaccination service has opened up in South Notts. Well done to everyone who has worked hard to get this up and running. Don't forget, the NHS will contact you when it's your turn for the vaccine 👇
1750	112175	It doesn’t matter to the Trump administration if you die before you get the coronavirus vaccine what matters is that they make profits for one of their campaign donors. We need to know what other vaccine candidates this admin supposedly has and who they are connected to.
1751	110231	@LubaK19260165 @ShaneCoombs @JoeSilverman7 There’s never before been a vaccine for a coronavirus for humans. And in animals they have actually caused more problems than they solve. We need to really make sure this is safe before we jump. I personally would not be first in line for this one.
1752	110634	@Coronavirusgoo1 After the news about the lack of efficacy of the   Oxford-AZ against the SA variant, it's all too predictable that the Gov will use this as an excuse to keep us locked down further...MSM now reporting until mid-May #fakenews #southafricanbastards #COVID19 #OxfordVaccine
1753	109048	@SaharaReporters @BillGates We only have God we the Africans, all the wars you're putting us in have not finished us. Covid-19 will not finish us too, Gates &amp; Melinda who are you to say this is number of people you want live in this world. Letz say no to the Vaccine. They will use it to kill us, beware
1754	110287	♥️ Like for #UP♻️ RT for #Biharfree #COVID19  vaccine to Winner state#Modi likes Bihar more so BJP's promise of free #Covid_19 vaccine in their Bihar poll manifesto #vaccinepolitics#BiharElections #BiharElections2020  #MirzapurWatchParty #MirzapurOnPrime #Mirzapur2
1755	108616	FAUCI: He's cautiously optimistic about a covid-19 vaccine because studies so far show that the body does mount an immune response both to the virus itself, and to vaccines in early trials. That response doesn't happen with HIV. So a covid-19 vaccine is much easier to make.
1756	111989	please remember that the vaccine does not prevent us from contracting COVID-19 (we are examples), we can still get it if we are not careful. So, I request those of you who have got the vaccine, to continue to take care as before (wearing mask, social distancing etc).
1757	111474	Confused about what the #VaccineStrategy will be like? #CowinApp will be very crucial for people like you and me. #vaccine
1758	112152	Herd immunity is dangerous for healthy people cuz of the long term effects!Also, we gotta lockdown until there’s a vaccine!Wait til he finds out how vaccines work. This is the “science” we are up against 🤦‍♂️
1759	109475	@DHA_Dubai i am dubai resident and i have got my covid-19 vaccine in my home country (pakistan) can i apply for covid vaccine certificate in UAE as well..? as i am in home country right now and want to flyback to UAE.
1760	108538	"@kasujja No, Alan, it's not ""looks like it won't..."" If Uganda was in advanced stages of starting clinical trials, we'd have long known; the whole world would have known. Brother, developing a Covid-19 vaccine is not some small random matter. I'm sure know this!"
1761	202066	My systematically racist white privilege means I have to donate my Covid19 vaccine to someone who needs it more. Enjoy
1762	107955	Some people don’t deserve a vaccine, and this is extremely disrespectful to everyone who has worked so much the past year.
1763	108210	"""Jabbed for Freedom""...yeah you still need to be masked, socially distanced etc. etc. because the vaccine doesn't give you Freedom, the vaccine doesn't work, but we needed a catchy slogan to dupe the idiots to get an experimental vaccine."
1764	112020	snakes carry vaccines, not viruses you were told snakes caused the corona virus, and then they changed the story to, caused by warm blooded species vaccines are on their way, they already hinted to it this is how the world works, it’s a story
1765	202004	I feel so grateful and privileged to have received the COVID-19 vaccine today. I’m hopeful that many others will soon have access so we can better protect our most vulnerable and each other. It’s still a long road ahead but it’s great to finally see some light! https://t.co/kUG7YyxT5l
1766	111023	@HHwfc @Cris_Without_H @radude6 @BBCWorld Yes, but the MRNA vaccine has been in development for a decade. My understanding is that HIV is difficult because it takes years to present in your system, but a coronavirus’s impact is virtually immediate, making it easier for the vaccine to work.
1767	109000	Has anyone else been feeling cold in the legs only ever since having their #BoosterJab? Since my booster, my legs feel like they have #coronavirus - the past week or so has been awful, aching legs, lower back in agony. Today I could barely drive the car, kept stalling it. 🤣🤦🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/CpmoyCmEYK
1768	110792	This would be the only dr I would want touching me. We don’t need doctors and nurses shutting their Covid on us. We need doctors that are unvaxxed .
1769	108240	Hope everyone 18 and old run to get the COVID19 VACCINE like they get Timmys coffee and KFC chicken now
1770	112865	@CNN I believe COVID-19 is man made, and this vaccine is not safe, but rather going to damage humanity.
1771	110943	@SizweLo There was never will be successful vaccines for coronavirus.... It failed before and it will fail this time...... The previous attempt on SARS and MERS also caused death in animals and neurological problems in humans.....
1772	111779	How can you possibly say this with confidence when the science doesn’t exist yet?! There have been no long-term studies on what this jab will do to women trying to conceive, pregnant women, and newborn babies because NOT ENOUGH TIME HAS PASSED in order to complete such studies.
1773	110105	One thing I'm curious about--COVID is not the only coronavirus with a spike protein. I'm genuinely curious as to whether or not the vaccine may inadvertently protect against other coronaviruses as well.Like the common cold, for instance.
1774	108937	@ventingmyangar Andrew, allow me to share some facts with you. THERE IS NO VACCINE THAT PREVENTS COVID19. Vaccinated can still get, spread, and die from the virus. Goal of the vaccine is to lessen the symptoms should you get it. So what good is a #VaccinePassport if we all can spread the virus.
1775	110782	We’re in Tooth Fairy territory here.• We know you’ve already had Covid19, so severe that you ended up in ICU.• We know you’ve had two vaccines.• The idea that you don’t have antibodies is absurd.Stop talking to us like small children!
1776	112891	@terryodance @danwootton I know this too Terry...and don’t you think if scientists had found a vaccine with longevity that the  world would take the same action to kill it off..it has been amazing that they have a vaccine for Covid-19 so quickly....
1777	112340	I am so deeply cynical about this “the vaccines are on their way, the end is in sight everyone!” narrative I see being pushed in the media and this right here is exactly why.
1778	110821	@PatrickPieper1 @SlapdashSanity @benshapiro February 25“CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.”February 25“I think that's a problem that’s going to go away… They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine.”
1779	107900	Taking shortcuts will usually get you to a location in a shorter amount of time.....however, with the rush to market shortcuts taken with coronavirus #vaccine .... I fear Americans will end up like The Donner Party with their doomed shortcut.
1780	112017	government has unconsciously stated that the Wuhan covid-19 is never going to go away! because they said they're going to build a facilities to produce the moderna vaccine in 2024!They said too!they have acquired 25 million vaccine!how many vaccines will U take over your lifetime
1781	202383	@djane_go @mmfa Really! My Q 2 @TuckerCarlson is, “ did u receive a COVID19 vaccine?” If so, wtf do u knw? U took a vaccine but didn’t knw science bhind it? Tht vaccine is as good as the strain it was design 2 protect? Tht ur propaganda 2 not vaccine actually contributed 2 mutations. So stfu!
1782	109050	Using vaccine as a bargining chip for political gain is cheap! Centre has not yet said that the vaccine will be free for all Indians but for Bihar they are promising it free for all just because they've polls. What if Bihar don't vote BJP? Will they still get it for free? Idiotic
1783	110312	@maks_amillion @SealTurtle @SamanthaX_real The flu vaccine has had decades of research.There has never been a successful coronavirus vaccine. Im sure you know why they had to stop the trials on mice and ferrets...
1784	110433	Is Israel hoping the virus will complete the work the bullets do not? Is this the reason for slow roll out to Palestinians of the vaccine?
1785	112471	@senatemajldr Even if you get Covid19 there is no immunity to virus and some people get it twice so we will need a reliable Vaccine.
1786	112654	@KING5Seattle If the PCR tests work-Why the false positivesIf the masks work-Why the 6 feetIf 6 feet works-Why the masks If all three work-Why the lockdownsIf all four work-Why the vaccineIf the vaccine is safe-Why the no liability clauseIf Covid-19 exists-Why has it not been isolated
1787	111769	@Brie_Shaniece @MukubuDieudonne @uglynewyork_ And how long did it take to make those vaccine flu vaccine 18yrs to get it to 80% chickens pocks 10yrs  Covid-19 6months
1788	112538	@xKELSOxTv @Will_Shirayuki @sorola Please explain how it was rushed. Lol we just invented MRNA in a few months huh? That 30 years of Coronavirus vaccine research had nothing to do with this???
1789	110121	@BetteMidler First, hardly anyone is allergic to peanuts so they should eat their own food, not penalize everyone else. Second, coronavirus is not deadly but the vaccines are, you don't want to be pushing those. And last but not least, you're a crazy old bat who's had her day. You may go now.
1790	108968	Imo this whole coronavirus deal has been a government plan for a long time in order for Marshall law, they will come up w a mandated vaccine which will have trackers/chips in them that we will w no choice HAVE to take. We will run out of supplies &amp; THEY will supply us w wtf knows
1791	109981	If the common cold is in the coronavirus family of viruses, then is it reasonable to conclude no vaccine will be created for Covid-19?
1792	108201	@Mac_D33 @KayMachitje @rramagwa You all seem to be forgetting that grade 1s will need somewhere to go. You also seem to be forgetting that the coronavirus is going nowhere until a vaccine is developed and rolled out. But good luck with those plans.
1793	108849	@tablefloor @News24 Makes no mudaphucking sense. When  these vaccines were introduced, they said they were going to PROTECT people from catching and spreading Covid19. All those who have Omicron are fully vaccinated.  Why are other countries banning them if they are less like to spread it??
1794	109350	@Mike22105780 @BetsyMaxwell10 @CodyElijah1 Are you including the COVID-19 vaccine because I don’t think it was investigated not for very long and obviously doesn’t last very long either get a grip find out the truth
1795	111898	#BillGates wants you and ALL of us to get the vaccine. Why has there never been a vaccine for the common cold? #VaccineAgenda #BillGatesVirus #BillGatesVaccines #BillGatesBioTerrorist
1796	112887	So they’ve started dishing out the killer coronavirus vaccine to continue thinning out the worlds population - let’s see how long it takes all these stupid sheep who are lining up to get it to start dying!!
1797	108583	They are coming out with an oral therapy, because they know the vaccines aren't cutting it... Wakey wakey!
1798	112676	@HermitRambler @deborahj77 Does anyone have a link for the lab rat info? Not that I don’t believe it (I will not comply), but of course when I Google it, all that comes up is a million links to “the COVID-19 VACCINE IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE” 🤦🏾‍♀️
1799	110311	I feel bigoted, I am set to get my Covid-19 Vaccine on Wednesday however on the form it asked specifically Biological Sex: Male or Female, that is fucked up and inconsiderate to trans people thus I selected Female, I hope it's not an issue when I go in for my 1st dose
1800	110975	"This is why you hav to do things to somewhat ""strengthen"" immune system before taking vaccine, like perhaps a vitamin-D regimen for a 2 week period before taking vaccine. Folks with low Vitamin D levels hav been confirmed to suffer more or even die from covid"
1801	107854	Coronavirus vaccine: A human challenge trial of Oxford University could start as early as October.How it works: In a human challenge trial, volunteers receive a vaccine and are then given a dose of live Coronavirus while they're monitered under strict Laboratory conditions.
1802	110093	Hey guys! Everything will work itself out if you threaten your employees to get a vaccine or loose their job. It’s awesome!
1803	110142	I feel for @MarkRichardson , 2 of my grandchildren were vaxxed against my son’s wishes. Now, one has Covid-19 today and the mother is sending her to our home ,where my son and I reside.Oh, this is the second time this medical trained female, has done this. Wants grandma to die?
1804	201931	One deceased of the deceased persons was unvaccinated, one had received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and two people had received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. One was an 80s woman who was a resident of an aged care facility where she acquired her infection. RIP.
1805	202380	Thanks to you, @POTUS Biden, I got my COVID-19 vaccine shot this past Thurs. I didn't have to call them. They called me because here in PA it was my turn being in the 65 &amp; over group. I marvel at the progress you've made in just over a month that trump had 4 years to do &amp; didn't.
1806	110851	So tired of hearing about anti vaccine individuals reflecting on their dumbness of not getting the vaccine!! We would be close to being done with this virus if it weren’t for them!!
1807	109940	She's overweight, a breast cancer survivor, has diabetes... Basically, a person for whom COVID-19 would cause serious illness. But no, she refuses to get vaccinated, even though she is not anti-vaccination (I think she's old enough to have the smallpox vaccine scar).
1808	112774	You think Scott?  What are the chances he has a secret vaccine?  How come none of those close to him never get it?
1809	108504	All this vaccine stuff has me thinking that the crazy non vaccine moms out there have actually been the smart ones all along! #novaccinesforme #COVID19 #WWG1WGA #QAnons
1810	112595	”NO! If I’m safe after the vaccine why should I care about anyone else?!” This really is the mindset of the right wing isn’t it? Selfishness &amp; shortsightedness, what sort of world would it be if everyone thought that. We would soon go extinct if we all thought like them #vaccine
1811	107689	To whom it may concern, I get two to three flu shots a year. I choose not get covid19 vaccines due to religious beliefs as  a anabaptist. I don't own a TV in my house. It is my choice as a person not get a vaccine.
1812	109652	"If you need any more reason not to vote for this White House this is it. No serious scientists and doctors are acting like herd immunity (without a vaccine) is a true option yet @realDonaldTrump appears to be embracing it. ""Pro life"" means nothing to him."
1813	112170	Okay, when even CHINA sees vaccine mandates as a problem, you know how authoritarian the u.s. is getting. I wonder if Xi is doing this to taunt us.
1814	111495	#COVAX gets vaccine all the way to the Pacific Islands! All the world must be vaccinated in order to protect us from the pandemic. It’s not “we” or “them”. It’s about all of us, in parallel. 🇫🇯🇺🇳
1815	201885	@BabyBoomerBoyya @Smilan317 My husband put it off until he couldn't handle the pain anymore.He called around, found a dentist that was very informative and used COVID-19 precautions.We just got our 1st Moderna vaccine yesterday.Good luck.
1816	112903	Covid is seasonal , winter is there and we see how these  countries’ cases are picking up (the numbers ) . Hope we all getting the jab while the ministry is getting ready for our winter ,
1817	108513	So why can’t we , in the interest of public health, disallow any patent to the vaccine when developed?
1818	111143	@laurenboebert @TuckerCarlson You can still get Covid-19 with the vaccine and spread it. You’re less likely to be hospitalized &amp; very unlikely to die from it. He should know this, everyone is reporting it. He’s deliberately spreading lies. You have to wonder how he lives with him self. No conscience I guess.
1819	112902	Not everyone is going to get a vaccine...not everyone wants a vaccine... when we eradicate the virus? That’s NEVER going to happen, COVID-19 is here to stay like the flu. If u think masks are temporary...THINK AGAIN, my guy. That shit is here FOR EH-VURRR.
1820	110456	@Meggone2 @LJayMax @Paramythia__ I think the bio-weapon is the vaccine not the Coronavirus2019 so the elites will know not to get the vaccine. I think covid-19 is just a flu because we have a different flu every year.
1821	108916	@Timcast What is skeptical is this doctor apparently doesn't know that if someone has COVID-19 infection already that injecting them with a vaccine wouldn't do anything since they already are producing the antibodies.
1822	111528	If one chooses not to get the COVID-19 vaccine due to misinformation, but is the first in-line to get an anti-body infusion once they catch COVID-19... then how does that line-up and make sense? #Reflections
1823	202128	Alhamdulillah that Allah SWT still let me live. I'm #covidvariantdeltasurivivor I wait for October to get my first #COVID19 #CovidVaccine Thank you for all my families and friends support while I in the hospital. Thank you for all doctors and nurses whom are taking care of me GBU https://t.co/LrOClUdMKx
1824	202396	As of Monday, 568,328 individuals had received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and 143,638 have been fully vaccinated.
1825	111163	A personal bright spot in a weird and disheartening week: My parents each got their first #COVID19 vaccine today! I won't say my home state is handling the rollout well but I will say my years of trying to get concert tickets before they sold out was put to use for a great cause!
1826	108395	Usual clinical path of vaccine development is 5-7 years, and yet here’s the sociopath @MattHancock  betting big on a vaccine, that has been conjured up in 9 mths. Not only has this crook played out a PCR test fraud on all of us, he now wants to clean up, with a vaccine fraud..
1827	111438	Welp the numbers are going back up, there isn’t a vaccine for kids under 12, and our governor said masking can’t be made mandatory. So, it looks like we are homeschooling for a second year. We are planning our curriculum &amp; about to head to the library for inspiration. 🤞🏻#COVID19
1828	109328	Three Covid-19 vaccine prototypes developed with pilot test results expected in June in Russia.  Hopefully the world is going to converge on a successful one in the very near future.
1829	112004	I’m sorry but I’m confused, how do you engage in illegal surveillance of me and frame it as COVID-19 contact tracing while demanding I give you my blood for a vaccine, please explain @migov @MayorMikeDuggan It makes no sense. @Ford @Harvard @SCOTUSblog @scotusreporter @IsraeliPM
1830	108147	@FlatFeminist OK DEAR ANTI VACCINE THIS IS OUR WORLD RIGHT NOW WITH OUT A VACCINE FOR THE CORONAVIRUS STOP THIS FUCKING BULL SHIT
1831	202079	Got my booster last weekend. Glad to have this service provided and the extra protection against the #DeltaVariant
1832	109490	@windycityrebel4 @BillShaikin No Fauci at the next press conference is gonna be like “The coronavirus vaccine will not come out until 2099, until then everyone stay inside your house”🤣
1833	109483	Don't be surprised if everyone on the planet tests positive for Covid-19This is how they are going to force you to take the vaccine.Mark my words folks.DO NOT TAKE IT!!!
1834	108716	I won't deny the clear reduction in deaths and symptoms that the vaccine has achieved. But there are serious questions about how it has been unequally rolled out - why it wasn't made open source - as it could have been - to battle a global threat. #rentiercapitalism
1835	109758	I’m all for motivation but what about everyone who called phone lines religiously multiple times everyday, waited in long lines, kept tabs on extra shots, and stayed home until they could get their vaccine? #wewantrewardstoo #niceguysfinishlast
1836	108533	Very glad to hear my friend @Pres_Sandoval is only experiencing mild symptoms. Like he said, COVID-19 vaccines are doing their job, and I hope he has a quick recovery.
1837	111396	@BNODesk We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies. Please help!
1838	112795	Pfizer characterized the best vaccine because it came from trump and Merkel that's why has 3 doses they put cancer in out and in again but Johnson puted in and puted out in only one vaccine the other vaccines are just for a normal sickness like COVID-19
1839	108023	@rjgoo Everyone will probably get the virus eventually anyways ... might as well pull the bandaids off and let it go through the population. There is NO guarantee of a vaccine as there has never been a vaccine for a coronavirus style sickness.
1840	109997	@ukiswitheu @jwahjwah Sadly, getting the vaccine as @sajidjavid has proved, isn't the panacea they made it out to be, initially, that's another fabrication of the truth. And #Covid19 isn't like the flu, it's much worse, yet another fabrication. The truth is we don't really know the facts.
1841	109164	Or, and bear with me here, just get a real vaccine card.  FOR FREE.  All it takes is one (or two) little shot(s).
1842	109077	We all need to work together to protect the world from #COVID19. Will @g20org states please step up and release much needed funds for response efforts to @WHO @CEPIvaccines and @gavi? Together, we can beat this pandemic.
1843	110522	@POTUS ... please deliver a fireside chat on the Covid-19 vaccine rollout. Explain how there was no plan and how your administration is going to right the ship. I think we need the truth and we need assurance that you're on this until we're all safe.
1844	109482	Going to have COVID-19 Vaccine tomorrow. I am nervous,not about the effects that have it. It's about my order is at 7-11 now and I can't even take the order because I don't have Cram School tomorrow
1845	108625	Indian vaccine is sold in Lahore Hyderabad (Sind)!Karachi for exhorbitant price go and get it if you aukaat. Your country doesn't have aukaat
1846	112612	So I went ahead and took a test for Covid19 immunity.Turns out I was negative, so now I have to keep wearing a mask until there is a vaccine.Dammit!
1847	201913	@BabyMeriel Yes, I do take ImmunPro most especially during the early part of the Covid-19 wave. I think, I need to buy again as my arm got a 1-week bruise gawa ng Janssen J&amp;J vaccine. Thanks for reminding me, I'll also take my vitamins regularly ulit.
1848	111018	Did you give your child a choice on a vaccine? Makes me wonder if you’ll actually put your own kids in the same spot as every other kid.My son had Zero choiceI’d rather him have #Covaxin Too bad tax paying American!@US_FDA you don’t have a choice
1849	108979	How are hospitalization rates increasing? Intensive care rates, death rates increasing, on breakthrough infections. ON THE SAME VARIANT?????????? How do vaccines work again?Am i the only one seeing this?
1850	108382	I guess we'll see another variant enter the stage in 2022 and we can only hope that the vaccines or antibodies after an infection will be able to cope with that one, while COVID-19 will slowly become an endemic disease.

1852	110766	I'm not worried about that vaccine or COVID-19 anymore. IF COVID-19 is my ticket up out of here, then so be it I'll take it. I'm not afraid 2 give up this world or this flesh suit. I've been dead b4 &amp; I'm ok with that i really am. When it's ur time it's just that.ur time.
1853	111844	@TeamYouTube I got the email, i removed the video they say i cant appeal it since i removed it, but due to being a federal contractor i had to get the jab, so i shared my experience in getting it, i didnt give out misinformation about Covid19 as it suggests i did.

1859	109722	Hi @denmarkdotdk! Please help me! What's latest good news about Covid19/Coronavirus vaccines &amp; treatments? Are you well connected with other countries? If so, may you please help us in US who wanna work, but can't because we're seen as inferior &amp; about to be enslaved? Please?
1860	111771	People of Lahore, don't forget it.. When coronavirus was only in China this govt forbid our own children to bring them back in Pakistan. Zulfi Bukhari let pass coronavirus patients - so we got coronavirus. This govt has gifted u this. Ye hamaray Punjab ko bura kahenge...
1861	110402	@therecount No-one knows how immunity to covid-19 persists in the body because we've only known about the existence of the virus for 2 years, and we've only had vaccines for 1 year. It may be we need 3 shots, like polio or HPV, or we may need period boosters, like tetanus.
1862	111919	@JeremyVineOn5 @jemmaforte @adepstein1 @theJeremyVine @StormHuntley @MattHancock Schools shouldn't be re-opened until we've got a vaccine or have worked out how to do social-distancing with groups of kids.If we can't do that, then we're putting all teachers and parents at risk and so it follows the rest of us.#JeremyVine #Coronavirus #Covid19
1863	111662	@realDonaldTrump Sad ! Should kids go back to school before we get a vaccine for this virus? I don’t think so.
1864	111420	@realDonaldTrump You not only tolerate it, u foment it! Forcing states to open up schools &amp; churches, with no coronavirus vaccine is structural violence. Not every body could afford the million dollar Regeneron cocktail they gave u. Plus u’re trying to take away ppl’s insurance amidst a pandemic!
1865	108880	Yeah I’m done being nice, if you don’t wish others well, I don’t wish you well 🤷‍♀️ if you actively refuse the vaccine and wearing mask knowing you’re endangering others then if you get sick I better see you refusing medical services too
1866	109641	Hi I'm a budding virologist, if there is a longform that explains if it is normal to start and stop specific vaccines like this...Please send me way for my daily COVID read...
1867	110791	@CTVNews Don’t take this the wrong way but, would she give the COVID-19 vaccine to her kids? Would Trudeau? I presume that is what they would be asking us to do.
1868	109887	@DrGregorSmith No need for the so called vaccine. The MHRA has enough evidence on the yellow card system to declare COVID-19 vaccines unsafe for use in humans. Dr Tess Lawrie
1869	109832	@POTUS or whoever is in charge of what happens with the COVID-19 I just wanted to say that if the vaccine doesn't go well and if people keep going out and partying and all then I think there should be another lockdown for a week or so. Nobody come at me for this please.
1870	111687	2Sooner or later everyone will get it if the vaccine/treatment is not found.Social distancing might be a precaution today , tomorrow it will be a lifestyle. #coronavirusinindia #COVID19 #Covid_19india #CoronaWarriors #CoronaUpdatesInIndia #coronavirus
1871	112386	Right now we are experiencing a world without one particular vaccine. If only we could do a split screen to show the world without any, just to see, just to check. #VaccinesWork #VaccinesSaveLives #COVIDー19
1872	110735	And the biggest problem is if unchallenged these narratives are self-fulfilling. The policy gets shaped to the narrative -- why work harder to get limited vaccines to people who don't want them? We just went through this with overdoses and black drug users.
1873	112874	The benefit does not outweigh the cost of widely testing. In contrast, the targeted testing strategy we've employed so far has not led to community spread. Furthermore, even if everyone tested negative, without a vaccine, we can all still contract COVID19 the next day.
1874	108719	@jeenasingh5 @DcpNorthDelhi @DelhiPolice There's no other way. Herd immunity is the only way because the virus has already mutated into 40 strands.We must assume there won't be any vaccine for COVID-19 in the immediate future and take it head on.
1875	109468	Exactly. There will NEVER be a zero rate of infection. A vaccinated person can still develop flu if the infecting virus strain is different than the vaccine strain. An educated guess is made each year to select the flu vaccine strain to use. Covid will be the same.
1876	108884	Please inject me with this 🙄My body is screwed up but I don’t get a cold #jabjabjabbyjab #makeitmakesense
1877	110664	I say if countries or particular group of people do not want to get #Vaccine they should lose right to travel outside of their country until they do get it. Enough with stupidity!

Strange how BP can find a vaccine so fast but we can’t cure CANCER,the money makes for BP, hmmm, govt scares me 2
1881	111151	@eddierowan6 Eddie do you not think that if there was a credible vaccine for Covid19 they would have used this? It’s not the fact they don’t want us well they want to stop the people from dying.
1882	201836	I’m finally COVID-19 vaccinated and so much weight has been lifted from my entire being. For those who are iffy about the vaccine, my side effects (chills and soreness) really was just 1-2 days. I will take that over the virus ANYDAY 😇✌🏼
1883	112619	In my opinion, the miniscule covid virulence for this age group does not warrant any new unknown risks from a vaccine. Especially if we are reaching herd immunity levels.These efforts are better spent on assisting 3rd world countries with their vaccination strategy.
1884	107826	"Folks.Invermectin is an anti-parasitic. Prescribed to battle parasites. Thus the ""anti,"" then ""parasitic.""COVID-19, a novel coronavirus, is a virus. Right in the name. Again.Antiparasitics are not indicated in the treatment of viruses. Targeted vaccines? Are."
1885	111923	Just stop with the Bullshit, Covid doesn't fn exist, until you get the vaccine that isn't a vaccine.... besides that, how tf do you know you have something that THERE NO VALID TEST FOR?! FK THIS DUMB ASS WORLD!
1886	112248	@KindeandTrue In Dec 2019, Moderna/NIAID signed a contract with Ralph Baric to research mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates by performing “challenge studies” in humanised mice.Any legitimate government would’ve made everything around this research public after 2 years into this “pandemic”.
1887	110732	The issue is that all USA federal employees, including army personnel, are required to have the covid-19 vaccine. People who would get it have already gotten it. People who wouldn’t get it just wont get it. I would be surprised if someone changed their mind on the vaccine for 50k
1888	202254	I read about this last week. I would prefer Moderna for a booster, if it is available when my turn comes.My first shot was Pfizer: slept almost the whole of the next day but no other effects. Moderna... I woke the next day and it felt like someone had amputated my arm lol.
1889	111909	Are vaccines helping? Do they assist humans or mutation?Seriously, who knows if they are better than the human immune system?Perhaps they are able to minimize the impact of the viruses effect?
1890	109582	@Loyd71460097 The COVID vaccine’s goal is to protect us from coronavirus. How is a simple vaccine injection meant to demoralise individuals and segregate them, based off what? What is this New World Order you refer to? It sounds a lot like the Thousand Year Reich to me, I’m just curious.
1891	112500	is this the vaccine approved by trump and pence?i can't take my chances when i'm dead, so i'll stay alive.thanx anyway, tho.

1893	111192	A woman in Dallas has tested positive twice now for virus this proves that we can be infected again after antibodies leave our system this changes everything that we hoped for it makes trumps arguments irrelevant this will not magically leave us until we get a vaccine

1912	110818	@GovKathyHochul 1. You fired healthcare workers for no good reason 2. Masks don’t work 3. Vaccines don’t make you immune to contracting or spreading Covid-19
1913	111418	@CelticAnarchy It's an interesting question! But it would need to be an antiviral that's1. Effective at removing most strains of coronavirus, it can't be retooled every year like a vaccine2. Have side effects mild enough for OTC usage, not likely because antivirals are rarely mild on the body
1914	112495	this is why ppl that are like “how did they come up with the vaccine so fast??” don’t make any sense bc it has literally BEEN HERE for YEARS.

1916	112825	"@SBSNews Uuuh what ""natural immunity"" for people who've had COVID19. You can get it more than once. This is one of the main reasons why a high efficacy vaccine is  paramount😳 It's not good enough to pitch ""eat what you're given or go without"". We're paying for this. Use tax money wisely"
1917	110912	If somebody discovers a vaccine for the Coronavirus, it will be interesting to see how many people refuse it.
1918	112068	I read there has never been a vaccine for any coronavirus. True? Yet they are gonna bang one out for COVID-19 in 9 months? Money would have nothing to do with that, would it? I mean a vaccine for the common cold would cripple the OTC drug companies. Right?
1919	112766	@ArcticTartan @PamBucci @Craig_A_Spencer Just like with the vaccine, is it still possible for a person with ‘immunity’ to transmit the novel coronavirus? Even after receiving the vaccine, people are being advised to continue to follow all the COVID-19 precautions. There’s still a lot to learn about SARS-CoV-2.
1920	112413	I missed the 500 last year. I won't miss it this year. I would drive down to @IMS to get my vaccine just for the experience.

1922	202336	@raja_1980 @chetanmudrabett @BBMPAdmn @BBMPSWMSplComm @BBMPCOMM @BbmpsplHealth @BBMPSouthZone Those who have already taken the first dose of #COVID19 vaccine should be given an online box to tick - I am willing to take the second dose earlier at 6 wks. And the opened vial for first time vaccination with one or two doses left with no takers, could be used in this manner.
1923	111342	this is fearmongering vaccines don't work all of the time and that's a small ratio if you think about it.

1926	108056	@buttonbox21 @frederickone Only way we are going to get rid of COVID-19 for good is a vaccine, it is not rocket science, otherwise year after year it is going to keep coming back and we will be in lockdown after lockdown of the lockdown and people like you will be responsible.

1961	202080	"""A source familiar with the matter told Reuters the trial would have been suspended if the volunteer who died had received the COVID-19 vaccine, suggesting the person was part of the control group that was given a meningitis jab."""
1962	108615	I recently had this discussion with my ENT. He said be sure to get a flu shot, which I do every year. I heard a stat that regularly getting that vaccine increases lifespan 13% 🧐
1963	110849	@MevrouS Rumor has it has to do with patent reducing you to a transhuman. I believe Covid-19 was made for the vaccine, that vaccine Agenda is yet to be known
1964	202063	We should all get our COVID-19 vaccinations. I got my booster shot today and experienced no side effects. I feel lucky to live in a country where we can rely on science to prevent serious illness. #GetVaccinatedNow #GetVaxxed

1966	110578	My dad recently told me that my great-grandmother had polio, and a physical disability as a result, which greatly impacted her life, and he's been thinking a lot about the polio vaccine too. He's been bringing it up to everyone who shares any hesitancy about the vaccine.
1967	112792	@raisingrocks @Rebekah_Bernard Very promising news in the war against Covid-19, the Moderna vaccine is found to be 94.5% effective against Coronavirus. very Exciting news!!!

1972	107738	No way they could’ve tested the #COVID19 vaccines long enough to know the various issues THEY HAVE ALL HAD before rolling them out. Capitalist interests are too important for normal trial periods. #Sarcasm

1974	112179	@Mememagician3 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump If he has trouble with her buying a paper, he shouldn't have given the huge tax cuts a few years ago.

1977	111604	Listen to elected officials who believe in science (like @GovEvers and @POTUS). The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and the best way to get our state back to normal. Have you gotten your vaccine yet?

1979	109025	This is actually normal but I cant lie and say I'm not apprehensive about a vaccine that has been so quick to be developed. Im basically considering this still a clinical trial. Thats why I'm not upset at any FDA regs.
1980	110559	Tripe, it will depend on how efficient the SNP Government is in organising the vaccine roll-out and we all know they don't have a good record on being efficient. 🤔
1981	108151	Have gotten flu vaccine every year forever. Have never had influenza. I’ll get flu vaccine again this year. Will not take a Covid19 vaccine
1982	110906	Let me tell everyone something to sum up this #coronavirus story.What happened to us was all a lie, there is no pandemic,everyone better find a way to convince themselves before it’s too late!They will try to inject you with something that’s not a vaccine!I’m not joking #Covid_19
1983	110478	@NickFavorito @cbrew1789 @johnrobertsFox How is it Russian roulette if you already have existing natural immunity from previous COVID-19 infection?! I am not saying people who haven’t been infected have immunity. But +34 million are confirmed to have had COVID-19 . THEY are immune. THEY do not need a vaccine.
1984	110653	@zerohedge We kinda need a vaccine first... bearing in mind that humans have never invented a vaccine for any coronavirus, ever...

1991	111166	@SPWTalessia @realDonaldTrump Can you give me more reasoning as to why mail-in ballots won't work amidst the coronavirus pandemic that has no vaccine as of yet? I'd like to respectfully discuss this with you.
1992	108530	I keep seeing headlines about someone catching COVID-19 after getting the vaccine, except they only got one of two doses, so is this really even news?
1993	110764	.@NBCNews do better. it is a known fact that the vaccine isn't suppose to prevent you from getting the virus. it stimulates our immune system to make antibodies to fight against the virus. your misleading headline is potentially harmful to others. @TwitterSupport
1994	110357	@thesamsorbo I’m not doing the vaccine. I’ve done the flu vaccine before but it made me so sick &amp; they always say “oh it wasn’t the right strain for this year” Now they are saying due to other variations of the coronavirus this vaccine may not be as effective as we first thot. It’s a guess
1995	112768	If substantiated, the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine would be a breakthrough in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.

1999	108597	This would be newsworthy if we were told the vaccine provided 100% sterilizing immunity immediately after the first shot, but that’s not what we were told, so what is the point of this story?

2014	107913	7. So this is what's been mainly going on here. Now it is time to traverse this phase of living with the coronavirus around and don't fell ill, until a vaccine is found. Hopefully at the soonest.
2015	111249	COVID-19 is a serious threat, like he mentioned in a reply, I don’t like the lockdowns, but I understand why they’re happening. However, he’s right, Canada needs to pull its shit together. Slow as hell on getting the vaccine, and people not listening. Cmon people.

2061	110546	What all this highlights is that big pharmaceuticals can obviously not keep up with virus mutations. Vaccines are obsolete within weeks of distribution. All the more reason to waive patents and open up manufacturing to speed up vaccine roll-out. #PeoplesVaccine

2080	112276	"@DMinghella From the outset, the WHO REFUSED to accept even mention of alternative treatments of what is in fact just a coronavirus.  Reason being that a vaccine mandate can only take place if no other measures are effective.  So everyone was silenced. That's our World ""Health"" Organization."
2081	108502	Coronavirus has changed my belief that all vaccines aren't necessary. If you have an ailment, and we have a cure, go get your diseased-self vaccinated!
2082	108690	Dear @fordnation , why not have lotteries? Participate in Canadian-made Medicago vaccine trials (or get any vaccine), and win a chance to get cash for an ecological home improvement, or win a Tesla, etc. #Canada #KitchenerCenter #creativity #COVID19
2083	109891	@MwanaMorogoro @jgwajima Let him speak against this poison you call COVID-19 vaccine.  This is a free country, not only to support government agenda but even going against them if they're not with any intended good.
2084	108163	U can only collect and sacrifice by murder. The coronavirus  is not natural. If people think the vaccine is meant to harm you, the idea that they created the virus is not too far fetched. Calculated Chaos. Souls have power.
2085	110771	I don’t care if I’m the very last person to get the COVID-19 vaccine, so long as my mom feels safe getting groceries on her own again.
2086	109648	@SkyNews What’s the point, how stupid, if people are 97.9% likely to survive with Covid19 why would you take a vaccine with only 90% effective in preventing Covid19.I won’t be taking the Vaccine....
2087	201807	So I’ve finally relented and decided to get my COVID-19 vaccine. I’m scheduled to receive my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine tomorrow morning. I didn’t come to this decision lightly and have been struggling with it for a while now.
2088	112802	"Good news but funny how it jumped from 90 to 95 after Moderna said theirs was 95%. Expecting Moderna to clap back tomorrow saying their vaccine is now ""infinity + 1 effective"". #vaccine"
2089	202219	Whew just got my first dose of covid-19 AZ vaccine in egypt here💉 the process quite fast here as 3 days after registration, i got message to go to the nearest hopsital to receive it. P/s: i'm very sorry bcs couldn't reply your messages fastly bcs of the side effect of it 🙏🏻 https://t.co/Mm56yQCOGD
2090	109010	@NikkeiAsia “Japan aims to use its planned certificates for coronavirus vaccine recipients primarily for international travel” - so a second summer banged up in this place while (older) Japanese people can freely travel to my home countries? 😰😰😰
2091	110007	@sarge4kentucky Screw COVID19!  Don’t give up!  Crawl to health if you have to!  Just keep breathing.  As long as you have a pulse, there’s hope!  Don’t give up!  There are thousands of people dying Everyday, don’t be a statistic!  The vaccine is coming!  Please hang on!  Believe that I believe

2093	202272	My older brother, Matt received his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine today. Our family is almost full vaccinated. Also, my friend, Jayson got his COVID-19 vaccine in Miami, his birthplace. Unfortunately due to immediate bookings, my dad get it tomorrow morning.
2094	108582	"It is very sad that someone can be so deluded.  Dictators love ""victories"" as absurd as they may be, because they believe that their people are so stupid that they will believe it too.  Example:  Right now in Russia they are promising people an untested #coronavirus vaccine."
2095	112925	Folks wont fall for THIS 👇WILL THEY 🤔WELL YEA PROBABLYIf people cant put 2+2 together after having jabs and serious side effects then they will actually start believing their imagining their symptoms because the Gov Scientist Said SoWAKEY WAKEY ! We dont have much time !
2096	108737	What do y’all not get? People are dying- is that not enough of a reason to stop partying, stop sports, and to socially distance? Y’all are acting like you can do whatever you want until the vaccine gets here.
2097	112461	This news could be groundbreaking in the hunt for a Covid 19 Vaccine. The Vaccine is the Silver bullet when it comes to defeat Covid 19.
2098	107709	@MarnixvdBroeke Data from where? And that may well apply to Coronavirus that humans have an immunity to it there are vaccines for. There is a reason that COVID-19 is referred to as a ‘novel’ Coronavirus.
2099	108669	@PoliticusSarah @politicususa Of course he did- he was told to before Russia released Covid19. There is a vaccine too. No one in place to regulate it. No one gets it.
2100	111416	Vaccine apparently to be rolled out next week, hopefully we can get back to normal soon. Still loads of people saying its going to connect us to the matrix like 😂
2101	110718	#NoMasks? why not #nohandwashing #nocleaning #noantibiotics #nochemo #notreatment while you're at it dipshits?If the vaccines/antibodies only last 4 months, we need to get rid of this the old fashioned way.#coronavirus
2102	110236	Hey #Conservatives, unless you have a specific and documents reason to not get the #covid19 #vaccine, I have no issues “discriminating” against you because frankly you are less valuable of a human being in my eyes. Get over yourselves already!
2103	111498	Providing the coronavirus vaccine via private healthcare is an immediate moral thing to do. Private sector will find their own ways to source it and won’t use the NHS supplies. I for one will NOT take it at an NHS facility and will wait for private healthcare, and pay for it
2104	111567	@mcallcott @jerrythegooner I AM a qualified MD. If you have to booster yourself every 6 months, or so, then it’s like getting the common cold. BTW, the common cold IS A CORONAVIRUS. There is NO CURE for the common cold because IT’S CONSTANTLY MUTATING ! HELLO !!
2105	108640	@Reuters Just now GOD/ALLAH/SHIV has suggested one mentioned below vaccine for this Coronavirus ---------  Don't visit any Church, Mosque &amp; Temple...until you permanently QUIT Smoking, Alcohol, Drug, PORN, Premarital Sex/Extramarital affairs.
2106	108999	People who are. Taking their kids for COVID vaccine trails may be they don’t love their children , children’s immune system is far more strong naturally
2107	110941	With all these photos of leaders and politicians getting the COVID19 vaccine injection, I haven't seen any doctors, nurses or any frontline workers getting theirs.Is there a chance they know something we don't...
2108	112190	@slava_pestov It’s not quite so simple.  A vaccine for coronavirus is not likely to be as effective as other vaccines.It won’t necessarily induce total immunity or complete protection.  And capitalism will impede distribution.Masking and social distancing will be with us for a few years.
2109	110599	@CBSNews Fact - Vaccinated individuals can still get Covid-19 and spread it. The vaccine only lessons the symptoms if you get it and does NOT prevent you from getting it! This is ridiculous!
2110	108908	Really so someone has a cold and we are all going to die again. Wake up love .its all a lie .covid19 is a virus but not a deadly virus we are being told .its all about the vaccine
2111	111172	An intensivists thread on communicating how vaccines work…I’ve used the following analogy for a while now.#COVID19 Think of your immune system as a police force, or better, a group of police forces like Interpol in Europe1/n
2112	110230	@Skitty_Bard @crownarmourer @Reuters @Holbornlolz UK normally has a vaccine damage payment of £120k, tax-free. But like I say, if you want to be a guinea pig, go ahead. I wouldn't touch it with a bargepole - assuming, of course, they get one (it'll be a first for a coronavirus if they do).
2113	109036	The yearly Flu is not owned by the Democrats but COVID-19 is their baby they paid for it and turned it loose . And apparently they had a vaccine before they released it . No top Democrat/Communist has contacted the virus 🤔
2114	109540	Looks like the Moderna vaccine that the US gov spent $2.5bn dollars on won't be tested/safe and they're going to overrule the FDA and distribute it anyway
2115	108588	The Democrat party is going all in to try and grab one party rule and turn the USA into a banana Republic where we will love under authoritarian rule under the leftist sheep and their leftist wolf masters, and they are not gonna give up#covid #covid19 #vaccine #vaccines
2116	109813	@RT_com They're running an intro sale as we speak. Buy one coronavirus vaccine and get an HPV for free!
2117	111410	By what they are saying on the news, the residents and workers in care homes have already been bumped down. Due to the fact the hospitals are the only ones so far that can store the vaccines in their 70 below fridges. 🤷#Alzheimers 💜 #Carers 💜
2118	112121	Appreciable gesture,it is how human is different than Virus.It will help in big way when Vaccine is only protection against pandemic but with limited availability.
2119	110955	While everyone's been at home they've been setting up the 5G 60 gigahertz Milla waves and once they turn it on many millions of people will become very sick with covid-19 symptoms and then they will lock down the world again and push the vaccine on everybody
2120	202446	My parents got their blue envelopes today with their #Covid19 #vaccine appointments. Had a wee lump in my throat when I heard. Not sure if it was relief, happiness, fear, anxiety or hope ... but an emotion nonetheless. We're getting there people! Slowly but surely 👍🤞
2121	108080	I've decided no vaccine is 100%. Based mainly on the fact no vaccine is 100%, but you try and tin foil it.#COVIDIOT
2122	201825	"""Although Russia was the first country to announce a coronavirus vaccine, only about 14% of the population has received at least one shot of a vaccine"""
2123	108594	1/ Me: Would it be so bad for this population to get smaller?]]Almost two years into the coronavirus pandemic, the movement to challenge vaccines’ ... has never been stronger. An ideology whose most notable adherents were once religious fundamentalists and minor celebrities is
2124	108627	I've asked this question before. Will the BLUE back YOU or will they enforce unconstitutional/unlawful vaccine mandates?. Here's the answer ⬇️
2125	112120	This is the right call, and they've also announced it before most people have started their training. Here's hoping we get a vaccine and can do all our gatherings in 2021.
2126	111339	@seanhannity One of the better idea's the court had. Now if only they could force Covid-19 death certificates to have an accompanying lab report identifying that specific coronavirus among all those in existence we might get past lock down! China was working on a vaccine, the virus existed
2127	112840	"Another good idea for implementing vaccines to those who think they don't need it!""Rhodes College in Tennessee will have unvaccinated students, faculty and staff pay a $1,500 fee per semester to cover the costs associated with a weekly coronavirus testing program.""#vaccinated"

2129	109556	When the hell do these clown's get held accountable ? There is ZERO chance they didn't know this would happen, so many countries shut it down. The allowed it simply because the vaccine numbers were low.This should be jail time for the deaths. Don't trust them do your own research
2130	112433	They approved a vaccine that didn't went through clinical trials and they're willing to give it to us for free, saying it's safe and it's about to be mass produced,, we're the clinical trial aren't we? Fucking hell.
2131	202121	Guidelines for persons who have gotten 'FULLY' vaccinated against #COVID19 .Fully = 2 weeks after the SECOND dose of a #CovidVaccine. I see people in #lka #SriLanka wandering around like no tomorrow with a single dose or nothing at all!
2132	112824	@BretWeinstein  UCSF has informed their staff (my BF included) that the Covid-19 vaccine is mandatory for all staff starting July 15th. It's part of the UC system but it's a bit sticky as they're a partner. My BF is well read on the research and doesn't want the vaccine.
2133	109061	"okay then. but to say that ""flexible learning"" is here to stay is like saying that CHED won't be exploring the chances of having limited f2f classes. vaccine roll-out is already accelerating. certainly, students and faculties have their utmost expectation to go back to f2f class."
2134	111738	@weartv No sympathy here.  Heard and read enough of these stories already.  It is people right to sign their death certificate if they don’t get the COVID-19 vaccine or #WearAMask. Do the right thing for the U.S.—#WashYourHands #SaveYourself #GetVaccinated
2135	111866	@NotABot42519864 @DK97682998 @ryanstruyk @realDonaldTrump It will never be zero unless a vaccine is discovered and widely applied. Antivaxxers won't take it so novel coronavirus will be with us forever. Stop spreading false info about this disease.
2136	110425	@lfpegorer @exame No vaccines exist that protect people against infections by coronaviruses, like the ones that cause WUHAN CORONAVIRUS DISEASE, SARS and MERS - so don't believe all the hype!!!
2137	108576	@btysonmd @EduEngineer @PierreKory @Covid19Critical @Cernovich @pnjaban @gummibear737We get discounted parking for vaccination in Malaysia. I think the free pizzas are a better enticement.
2138	111202	I can’t stop laughing at this. she put in so much effort to get a vaccine card that looks like a 9 year wrote it, only to get arrested and lose thousands of dollars 😂😂😂😂
2139	109841	Im gonna drag my sister like for realWith my cousin too 😂Wait for us #MewSuppasitNext year for sureLet the Covid-19 vaccine available 1st na Mew😊
2140	112847	Why would anyone do this??? Vaccine could be more harmful than Covid to youngsters and it doesn't stop it spreading so......no fucking way is my child having this!!!!!
2141	112064	@CDCgov  I know you are busy but can we get a vaccine for tiktok before one for the coronavirus? Please
2142	109120	would be nicer if patents were abolished so countries can produce their own vaccines but the west always wants to play the hero

2145	112675	If they can’t develop an accurate coronavirus test that works, why would I believe they’re capable of developing a vaccine that would?
2146	110743	We don't have any vaccine for Covid-19 in India. It is expected to come next year. So how negligent UGC can be for students#WakeUpMHRD@DrRPNishank
2147	107880	Yes please. Because It takes a while for the vaccine’s protection to kick in, so you can still get the virus. Until at least a week or two after getting your second dose. Stay safe 🙏
2148	108190	My two will definitely be getting vaccinated. I’m so excited that we are going to soon put an end to this pandemic through this vaccine. Please consider vaccination for you and yours ❤️
2149	108621	We are still positioning ourselves as to who gets the vaccine tender...once we done with that then we will reach the global percentages
2150	110992	Looks like Trudeau has in fact been getting vaccines to Ontario and doing so quite speedily. Originally we were told September and then July for this good news.
2151	111179	People are so stupid.. They missed  their holiday vacations, attending cinemas, football matches that they blindly take the covid 19 vaccine without questioning. They are slave to the government. Sad #Covid19 #coronavirus #corona

2153	110990	@Dalal415182053 @thehill The vaccine leaves a 5% possibility of getting COVID19.  Every person who is vaccinated is NOT going to get COVID19 just because there is a possibility.  Again, give me the statistics that out of all the people vaccinated, how many have gotten it.
2154	108077	"Why? Because the ""vaccine"" does NOT, must I repeat NOT, immunize you against the virus. Vaccines inoculate. This is NOT a vaccine."
2155	109043	@doodleslave You can't get Covid19 frimi a vaccine. There is no way. This is just a reaction to mrna in the vaccine. Your immune system is reacting as it should.
2156	109391	the racism happening is inexcusable, however more people are worried about the coronavirus because it's new, there's no vaccine, and it spread to the u.s real quick. the flu vaccine isnt 100% effective and not everyone has access to vaccines 🙃
2157	111117	And to make matters worse,they are saying this variant may be very resistant to the current vaccines. It’s traced back to an African country after someone’s travel there.Just when we thought we’d get a break!🤦🏿‍♂️
2158	109186	If a vaccine was developed for the coronavirus I wonder how many anti vaxxers would be getting first in line to get a shot! 🤔
2159	108717	Am all for a #vaccination  for #COVID19  absolutely but I also don’t think this vaccine has been tested long enough for future effects.  But i do think if @BorisJohnson is putting laws out there saying don’t have it you don’t work or holiday. I think he should start the trend
2160	110580	Please explain to me why people like McConnell and Trump get the first doses of the vaccine when 1) they said it was a hoax 2) get the best covid treatments that no one else gets 3) they don’t wear masks 4) they didn’t buy enough doses for everyone
2161	109408	@realLizUSA If I remember correctly from what I read about the research done on the coronavirus an easy peasy explaination would be we had a working vaccine for SARS 1 &amp; MERS they just tweaked it for SARS 2. Wouldn't take 5 yrs w/ the technology we have today.
2162	110282	@Techsports8 @MaxWinebach Just stop. You’ve lost all credibility. Oh, the earth is not flat, vaccines are a good thing, coronavirus is not a hoax, masks help.
2163	110370	@CathyMohlahlana @mamaboitumelo They must do what they feel is best 4 their kids. Its each man 4 himself now government is tired whatever they try someone will complain. Truth is the only perfect time to open schools is when we hv a cure or vaccine 4 coronavirus
2164	111395	What comfort is there for anyone in LTC care or their family that any worker taking one week education on Covid19 or having a medical exemption ( WTHISTHAT) can keep them safe ? What ? Get the vaccine. If your fear of the vaccine lets you make others deadly sick, get a diff job.
2165	108202	This is why we can't have nice things in this country -- B/C there is far too large a portion of our population who refuses to take a safe, effective, free vaccine, but who will gladly ingest livestock dewormer...
2166	109177	@toleafoa_ I read an article about how they wouldn’t guarantee a coronavirus vaccine to be affordable for everyone because they need the private sector to invest.
2167	109389	@citizentvkenya The coronavirus variant in South Africa, Brazil.......these two countries administered the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine trials...Kilifi County will be the next venue for a variant case
2168	108558	Can the COVID-19 vaccine cause Bell’s Palsy Beware of the vaccines because they will either make you have adverse side effects or possibly kill you. DON'T BE STUPID, DON'T TAKE THE VACCINES!! #CORONAVIRUSFRAUDSCANDAL
2169	112685	This will spread to all walks of life. The masters want and need their control. It's like a drug for the elite. Prepare for, you can only return to work or school if you have vaccine.
2170	112918	@SocialistVoice If, coronavirus self-isolate why we need vaccine and Why, Boris have to stay in hospital catch coronavirus we don't need? also, is life only cost £500? not even worth by Boris.
2171	112659	Good. You shouldn’t be working in the food industry if you’re refusing a vaccine during a global pandemic. Can we please stop being stupid for 1 day
2172	112256	@IanLaveryMP The objective was to flatten the curve.Anyone who believes that you can stop viruses without a vaccine is insane it will distroy everything else if you try.There is no vaccine for SARS CoV1 2003 MERS CoV or coronavirus that cause 30% of Colds.Stop living so that you don't die!
2173	111597	we need to find  a cure we need the virus erradicated vaccines dont do this why are scientists not finding source and cure ? @CDCemergency
2174	110413	Clarification that’s not 100% true, the flu vaccine is made using different techniques and not an mRNA vaccine. There are currently 3 different ways influenza vaccines are generated. The Covid vaccine is first mRNA vaccine but that technology has been in development for 30yrs.
2175	112291	Weird Stuff-Folks-“If they develop a vaccine for #Coronavirus I’m not getting it, can’t trust the government.”Same folks -“When’s the government gonna tell me what to do next”? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔

2178	111296	The side show is coming &amp; we hope there's not one news agency that falls for it. Trump getting a vaccine on TV? Oh please, supposedly he had covid, although it could have been re-election ploy, for all we know, its saline. means absolutely nothing, NOTHING! He has no transparency
2179	109121	Madagascar made a coronavirus medication, the world rejected it because it is from Africa. The West made a vaccine, we are forced to take it without questioning it, WHY? By the way Madagascar only has 42,800 cases &amp; 958 deaths, way lower compared to countries taking the jab
2180	109084	If we're not going to EUA the AstraZeneca vaccine now we really should export it. After about the next month we're not going to need it.

2186	111997	@islanderfb16 @wjxt4 The flu can absolutely be lethal, but the important distinction is that it’s less lethal than coronavirus and that we don’t have a vaccine that would help even 10% against it. It’s kinda crazy seeing how much Covid has killed in just 6 months in comparison to the flu so far. :/
2187	107912	We have to be so grateful for the vaccine...instead anti vaccine Americans are refusing them..medics have to trash the xtra vaccines while some counties don't have enough The press is not reporting the atrocious vaccine trashing.shameful

2192	110811	@goodmanxulu229 @EFFSouthAfrica @NalediChirwa @Julius_S_Malema How helpful have bricks been to us during this covid19 stop, even India is refusing to take back their fluids they call vaccine with less than 22% efficacy.. so the unity we claim to have as BRICS countries is only good when there is no disaster. BRICS is not for the needy
2193	108992	As the looney left tries to force vaccine mandates, the makers of the vaccines are now admitting the vaccines don’t work.  If they did work, they would not be suggesting boosters two months after vaccination.  Wake up, sheeple!
2194	110553	@Dr_Ellie In my 30s with asthma and not yet had pneumonia jab so getting it asap despite detesting needles ! Have had flu one. It can only help, even if it doesn’t for covid-19!
2195	108936	Does anyone know if it’s ok to travel from WA to Nevada with only one vaccine? My second isn’t scheduled until after my trip. Is quarantine required? It’s only a 3 day trip #cdc #COVID #COVID19 #vegas #nevada
2196	111680	Why do all these conservative Republican @gop suddenly want the first Covid-19 vaccines?? Don’t they keep saying it’s a fake virus?? Were they lying?
2197	110087	Another angle to consider - the first vaccine w/ an EUA will enjoy an unprecedented infusion of public-private funding + manufacturing. There are incredible resources primed to go. We don’t don’t want to unleash these resources on what turns out to be the “least good” vaccine.
2198	111051	@PolitiBunny @DeAngelisCorey My daughters are RNs and caught COVID19 while serving on the front lines during the pandemic. They are barely allowed to work because they refused the jab. They are already immune!
2199	108321	@Jim_Jordan @JkgaddisJulie Microchip everyone while they think they are taking the COVID19 vaccination!  Maybe there really isn’t a vaccine and the plan is for all people to be microchipped!  Scary!
2200	110967	When you see so many #COVIDIOTS out and about, getting too close in shops etc, I do think once we've all been offered the vaccine, we just let it rip. It will kill some of the idiots and many will get long #COVID19 but as least we can all just get on with our lives.@BBCNews
2201	108904	Question for those that know: if Biotech updated their mRNA vaccine to target the Delta variant instead of the original version, will they need to do trials again or can they go straight to the market? #Pfizervaccine #coronavirus
2202	111484	@derekobrienmp We know @MamataOfficial is very much concerned about Covid-19 situation but sir, it's an SOS, please place the order for the vaccine for everyone in the state, whatever the cost may be. Please do not go for another tug of war with centre. Everything can wait.
2203	110770	@weijia @CDCgov So it's not really a #vaccine  if you can still get #COVID19 after it.#NoVaccine #NaturalImmunity
2204	112268	What is happening in Melbourne will happen in Canada - before long.There is no truth or clarity of thought.*80% of Canadians are fully vaccinated.They are rejoicing. They say the vaccines work. But angry at the unvaccinated. They think they will get Covid19 from the unvaxxed?
2205	112890	@TweetTruth2Me_ Same. I’m worried the v is going to destroy their immune system and they are going to have to rely on a “booster” for coronavirus and flu for the rest of their lives. Imagine tge control they will have on people when they rely on the government to live. In comes digtal passports
2206	109434	@GovWhitmer Why is taking so long with covid19 vaccine what's going on why everything is slowing down now . ?
2207	109987	@Evar_Galois @strauss_matt Dying from Covid-19 or any reason is never good news. It is very sad, but is  just part of the reality in pandemics like this. We can't do much to avoid it, if we have no vaccines. In case of this virus, we didn't until now. Better times are ahead.
2208	109218	@MarkHubbard33 @Mihi_Forbes Further  the spike protein in Covid-19 vaccines is genetically modified to enhance the immune response and to stop it binding to cell receptors in the same way the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein would. Hope this clears things up
2209	112627	@jonathanec12 @ScottGottliebMD It's saying that we won't get herd immunity from the vaccine but if we get COVID-19 it will be less likely to kill us. What do you think it says?
2210	111381	@elemental @ASlavitt Where are those immunologist who understands that this coronavirus attacks humans who have an unhealthy body metabolism and pH factorsWithout a vaccine immunology and immunotherapy are the only way to combat this virus.It's an RNA protein has a fatal attraction for malnutrition
2211	108708	Could someone please ask Dr. Fauci why a vaccine will confer immunity that actually contracting the coronavirus doesn’t? #COVID19
2212	108244	So what happens is FDA only approved Pfizer and not moderna. How does everyone get boosters if they originally got moderna or JJ shot? Your not suppose to missmatch the vaccines. I think this is a important question to figure out before mandating  vaccines. #FDA #VACCINE #COVID19
2213	110959	It's GOT to be this way.We've got to save our country.If we have to fire people to do it, so be it.They need to simply get the vaccine.I don't feel sorry for them.It's their choice. 👠
2214	109182	I'm going to get the COVID-19 vaccine, but I'm so worried. It's hard to know what the right answer is because there is so much information about the risks and safety.
2215	112883	There is a certain irony between how the vaccine is being managed in contrast to the virus itself. #COVID19

2222	108634	@MissIgraine @corybernardi @PORTABLEAIRSYD Has anyone even come up with a cure in the last 100 years (100 years). It's a long time isn't it! All the vaccines are trash that is why influenza is so heavily monitored or was until Covid-19 became popular. The only risk is the persons age or current condition before infection.
2223	108956	@NotReallyIrish @realistgeo @EconomicsTeach5 @BBCr4today @BBCNews Nope, it's capitalism. But what loads of people tweeting about this want to believe is that there is an unholy Bill Gates-led Covid-19 plot to control everyone through a gene-splicing vaccine. It won't be rushed out on Gates' say so. And there isn't one anywhere near ready.

2227	110210	The problem is with COVID-19 and other pending pandemics, we need to monitor who is coming in to America because some could be sick and NOT all Americans believe in vaccines, so it is a national security issue. And yet they want to lock Americans and their businesses down.
2228	112508	With uncontrolled spread in various places (including India) there is a risk of a new vaccine resistant variant springing up.So the studies that say I'm safe from the standard variants are not good enough when I don't know the travel history of the person on my sidewalk.

2230	111783	No shit. I think we’re all starting to realize this. Good news for vaccine makers I suppose. Bad news for people who hate needles.

2232	109974	"""My position on how to deploy the vaccines is clearly stated in the Washington times op/ed.  We differ on that aspect."""
2233	112435	There are only two ways to get past this virus 1) everyone gets it and many die but the rest achieve herd immunity.😥 2) An effective vaccine comes.In the meantime we must believe a vaccine will come so we protect ourselves &amp; our neighbors with masks. #COVID19
2234	108970	@IngrahamAngle @Harley44650260 No, only American's have to, and I've not known one person that's gotten Covid19, or even died. It's just new world order💩from the government!! But ignorant people buy right into it.. Getting the Vaccine Is The Killer.
2235	112808	@menen_c @cspan @JeromeAdamsMD @COVIDOversight @FoxNews was caught covering up cures for the coronavirus. The vaccine isn’t the only cure out there.If you think it is or believe that natural immunity is no longer a viable option in the real world their mission is completed.

2239	108478	@temafudge @traependergrast Honestly, I am taken aback when my white patients start talking about the vaccine like it’s a magic bullet that will make COVID-19 a memory any day now.

2298	202360	Y’all can still catch COVID-19 with the vaccine just like the Flu. However, the flu shot is FDA approved AND you at least have options on how to cure it. With COVID-19, you’re just winging it and hoping for the best.

2321	201921	I cried quite a bit today but also was FINALLY able to schedule my first appointment to get the COVID-19 vaccine 😭✨
2322	110547	"Why? It's just a flu and it's safe to send your kids back to school.Clearly, if we wait just a little longer it will just go away.And this the easiest coronavirus in the history of coronaviruses to fix, so a safe &amp; effective ""warp speed"" vaccine will magically appear soon."
2323	109395	@talkRADIO coronavirus vaccines have no long term data and yes would never ever have a flu jab as effacy  low &amp; it damaged my mothers health.
2324	112293	Is it just me who thinks they are coming up with new shit to scare ppl and make them take the vaccine?
2325	112932	@hello2youz @king_wynn2810Q @Craig97640805 I mean it’s all out there. If you want to decide that this vaccine is not a failure, I will view you as pathetic and in denial. The vaccine is not effective, it is not safe, and wait for peak coronavirus season and that ADE to hit. It already has and we aren’t even in winter.
2326	109667	@Sharon81243753 @guypbenson We’ll never have herd immunity. Respiratory virus 101. There’s always a dominant respiratory virus. Most times it’s an influenza virus. Sometimes it’s a coronavirus. They never go away and no “vaccine” or mask will change a thing. Influenza will figure out how to be #1 eventually
2327	109614	@LukeMeliaTCh @InkedUpSHAQ You do know a vaccine is already in very advanced stages right? Same as Smallpox, Meningitis, Polio and others Coronavirus has already came to humans previously and has been broughtnto zero cases the same will happen with this strain
2328	108175	"I just don't ""get it."" What are they waiting for - the remainder of #LTC residents to die &amp; then they can pass the vaccine on to others?"
2329	112715	All anti vaccine folks out there, your children will get older and develop underlying conditions. This coronavirus will always be around. Do you really love you’re children?
2330	112195	@stillgray @woodens11563209 I’m not anti vaccine , I’ve gotten my vaccines as a child and I occasionally get the flu vaccine… but when it comes to this COVID-19 vaccine that was made in less than a year.. hard pass, ima wait awhile and then probably take it

2332	109421	"""Previous coronavirus infection gives people MORE protection against reinfection than the Oxford vaccine, PHE study finds..""ACCORDING TO MY QUACK I HAD THE VIRUS IN FEBRUARY WHEN we werent TOLD?-but CAN I have a Test for certain now-NO FUCKIN CHANCE they just wanna JAB me-UPURS!"
2333	111397	40 year old, unvaxxed coworker tested positive for covid. Told me that he “woke up drenched in sweat this morning before coming to work” like, bitch, this is how you spread. Don’t come into work sick #COVID19
2334	112477	Question, how do you feel about taking a vaccine for the coronavirus? Or for your family you know all vaccine is poison you know that right none of it is healthy none of it is save all vaccines are poison. That’s why they plan to force it on us.
2335	202156	Well, that's me all jabbed up. Second dose just received. #AstraZeneca so not looking forward to the next 72 hours but it's better than COVID-19 or Long Covid! If you're offered jabs, please take them! 🙏 Let's get back to some normality! https://t.co/jfYx7TDrge
2336	110492	I will preface this by saying I am not antivax. My kids are utd on all their vaccines.  This however is a completely new experimental shot with too many side effects to just shove under the rug.
2337	111619	? If you're suffered from covid-19 and you're admitted in hospital plz don't take vaccine. Because vaccine has work on immunity top to bottom in the first time and patient also loss immunity so my opinion is avoid vaccine if you are admitted.
2338	201881	@V103Atlanta @DjPnutMusic @djsturgess @KennyBurns I CREATED MY OWN PROSPEROUS WINE BBQ SAUCE AND I ALWAYS WALK BY FAITH AND NOT BY SIGHT SO I SENT MY BOTTLE TO FOOD NETWORK. THEY OPEN MY PACKAGE AND SEND IT BACK TODAY. I HAD TO THROW MY HARD WORK AWAY BECAUSE I WASNT SURE IF THEY INJECTED IT WITH CORONAVIRUS VACCINE.
2339	111303	"@FlowersEnglish Too true they are!  Thoroughly fed up with virtue-signalling anybodies on social media too...like the ones that add banners to their profile pics e.g. ""I've had my Covid-19 vaccine"". Yeah great but does advertising that make you feel better if you get 5 more likes before lunch!🙄"
2340	110951	It doesn't care who you are, what you did or said, how you feel about it or vaccines.It just tries to kill us all.Wake the fuck up and get the shots!
2341	110476	#Lollipop China offered its expertise in fighting COVID-19 and said vaccines that are being developed would be shared with the all three countries(Afghanistan,Pakistan,Nepal).
2342	202366	🇨🇦🛑  Two NUNS DIE after Covid Jab The outbreak comes just two days after the sisters got their first COVID-19 vaccine shot.Dr. says quite common ❓
2343	109555	The only acceptable reason for not getting the coronavirus vaccine is if you want to do kinky bug chaser play with your Dom
2344	110128	The so called covid19 has never been 1. Grabbed (isolated)  2. Visualised 👀 3. Purified, nobody on the planet can make a vaccine blindly!! Wake up !!!!
2345	109220	Well I signed up for the @moderna_tx COVID-19 clinical study today. I swore I wouldn’t take the vaccine, but have decided if chosen that I would go ahead and get it.
2346	108798	@AdamBSullivan Good for you Adam! Please help us remind folks that COVID-19 vaccines are incredibly effective in preventing hospitalization and death.  This is the way to beat the virus.
2347	108770	"I've created a new word for this shit:Propag-ercion""As you won't get a vaccine, we're going to tell you reinfection rates are going to soar with this variant"". Based on absolutely zero evidence or science!"
2348	111246	@torreymspears A Coronavirus mutates so fast. It mutates at every infection of a new host. Your vaccine cannot keep up with that and they know it. The Flu doesn't mutate, it drifts and shifts. LOL!  They can't get the Flu vaccine to work properly yet they can get a CV vaccine working?
2349	110090	if you see these vaccine things claiming COVID19 injections, then stay out of their way, especially if you are HIV negative. Always gotta be using another twisted distortion of another's research. I am US Gov't employee #COVD19.
2350	109798	@PeteDominick fascinating replies in this thread. next time @aaronecarroll is on pod, would love to hear if he’s seeing research on #COVID19 vaccine showing this
2351	110301	So remember, not letting the guidance out won't make the vaccines come any faster.  And if the vaccines aren't demonstrated to be safe, providers will not recommend them for their patients. The WH raising objections over safety surveillance is incredibly damaging to confidence.
2352	109626	@PeterNavarro45 @POTUS It is not the china virus. That’s racist. It’s either coronavirus or COVID-19. Any vaccine that takes any shortage of time Without taking every precaution will not be a vaccine that I can take. I need to know that it’s safe and I would think most people would but I could be wrong
2353	111593	The three stooges are going to present an illusion to the public.“Former President Obama, Bush and Clinton volunteer to get coronavirus vaccine publicly to prove it’s safe.”
2354	112776	So now Covid-19 vaccines will be ready for the first Americans in 3 weeks?? Yea I don’t think i’m getting it any time soon, somehow every company is just getting faster and faster
2355	201898	@MoHFW_INDIA @CovidIndiaSeva @PMCPuneI am a healthcare worker. I got my first dose on 6th March at Kamala Nehru Hospital, Pune. My name in the covid certificate has gone wrong. How can I change it?? Is there any process to do the same??#COVID19 #CovidVaccine #Pune
2356	111961	Hah!? So, doesn't that assertion begs the question: So what good is the vaccine? An answer: It's time we perform the ages old haruspex on such sacrificial animals.
2357	110061	@RepublicanSwine Marcus Lamb, founder of the large Christian network Daystar, died after contracting the coronavirus. Lamb's network during the pandemic has made the virus a huge focus, calling it a satanic attack that should not be treated with vaccines.
2358	109720	It’s tiring listening to these high sounding nothing speeches on “vaccine inequality”. The world is unequal do you miraculously expect COVID-19 pandemic to fix cleavages of  inequality ? 🤷🏿‍♂️ The pandemic is accentuating our reality. Let’s keep it going stop pretending you care 🙏
2359	112312	This Covid-19 vaccine shouldn’t be the people’s vaccine, it is a vaccine for those affected with the corona virus 🦠. Not even 1% of the world was affected, the covid 19 isn’t biological developed by the human body, why should it then be termed a vaccine for all?
2360	108871	@notinphilly69 @washingtonpost do you know how vaccines work? There are decades of research on how vaccines work. Coronavirus are NOT new, THIS strain IS. The more you know!
2361	112320	@robert_weiter @shootingsteady @kmoxnews @kmoxmaria @senatemajldr @VP @CBSNews Just to let you know, COVID-19 isn't going away without a vaccine. Even if everyone stayed home and never saw another human being for 3 months. It will always come back as soon as schools open and businesses reopen.
2362	109964	Logic tells me:If ppl can choose the vaccine they want = there will be a less popular vaccine = vaccine wastage Wastage of vaccine = wasting tax payers' money...unless we have Toyota inventory management techniques.
2363	107942	"@ArvindKejriwal I have already gone through a Covid-19 Phase in my life recently.""Is there any need for me to take that vaccine??"""
2364	109746	@BrianH618 I think it’s an absolute terrible idea. No way to even know if Covid-19 is better or worse in the spring. Also, even with vaccine, no guarantee fans, players or coaches will take it. One study said 2 out of 5 individuals surveyed said they would not take a vaccine.
2365	109851	I guess I'm curious as to why this is question with ONLY THIS vaccine. Why not MMR or dTap when we had a whooping cough or mumps outbreak in recent years? Those are easily transmitted, too. #VaccinePassports #vaccination
2366	107685	@jablamsky @JoTrader4 @GrowthStockDoc I added a lot to $DKNG in the 42s - after already having a decent size. Love this one for long term. They're looking great.Every bad covid-19 news might bring it down, but pro sports are still happening - The 2020-21 NBA season will begin on Dec. 22 and NHL will start Jan 1st.
2367	108005	@btckershi @btcbraj @ZLOK @MrHodl @maxtannahill i've had numerous coronavirus infections. i expect the vaccine will not prevent you getting another one. i think that is the opinion of medical people these days also. immunity is not a binary, thus the certificate is a fraud.
2368	108666	My question is this, The vaccine remains the same and yet the virus keeps mutating. How would a booster help if it is the same vaccine I took originally? Hope someone has an answer.
2369	112832	I would say it’s a positive step that pregnant women are now being offered the vaccine &amp; can make an informed decision about whether or not to receive it. Some won’t be able to get it, others will decide not to but the key word is choice. 1 in 2 is not a bad uptake so far either.
2370	109256	chromatica covid-19 vaccine is in stores tomorrow, give it up for chromatica covid-19 vaccine you guys!
2371	110224	@Shubham_Neuro @sciphi_Ananya @WHO @BharatBiotech I think Covaxin is the best COVID-19 vaccine available in the world today. It’s the traditional vaccine made from inactivated virus. All other vaccines are either mRNA or DNA based vaccines and we have no clue what are the long term side effects going to be?
2372	109979	"@PeterHotez They spent 16 years collecting any-and-every coronavirus variant that they could find.I don't think they were ""making a vaccine""."
2373	108894	@DCJanarchy Even after many years of research no vaccines exist that protect people against infections by coronaviruses, like the ones that cause WUHAN CORONAVIRUS DISEASE, SARS and MERS - so don't believe all the hype!!!
2374	109852	tw// needles, mention of sickness?  i just saw ppl making a coronavirus vaccine on my news station and got so dizzy n nauseous Christ JFODLD i hate needles
2375	112805	Mothers Husband was a trusted traveler in China. I created the Vaccines formulas for HIV COVID-19 &amp; THE BUBONIC PLAGUE correctly this time on my Facebook. And every single person deserves it depending what virus they have. And I have all of it. @POTUS I think you need to go back
2376	108027	@therumhammer @ImmunoGangster I think long non coding RNA is involved in cancers not sure if it's the case of this COVID-19 vaccine, isn't it?
2377	109311	@acidcigarfan @Tactical_review How long do you think coronavirus vaccine research has been around? It all began in 2002 with SARS and then continued with MERS in 2013. That’s a big reason it came out so fast https://t.co/axATzId7Rz
2378	108739	If there's any sentiment for giving Trump credit for the COVID vaccine, this has to be the second sentence in the statement.
2379	111555	In case you find this confusing, or think they don't know what they're talking about/doing, THE CDC HAS LOWERED THE NUMBER OF DAYS TO QUARANTINE FOR THE SAME REASON THE VACCINE IS FREE:💥CAPITALISM💥 They need us at work to keep the economy running &amp; the top 1% earning!
2380	110904	Should #Guatemala (and other countries) have to close their borders, it creates an interesting dilemma for those who chose to go abroad for their #covid19 vaccines. Because the country is one-two months behind them, so when they need a booster shot there could be lag.
2381	111706	So crucial for EVERYONE to get vaccinated. We've eradicated a slew of deadly diseases in this country this way. These vaccines work. PLEASE. Just do it. We will never truly be done with Covid-19 at this point, it's just too late, but we can regain our freedom and security.
2382	111302	@SnypLuciano @YouTube Yep but this is what we are dealing with on the left. This is why they are pushing for a vaccine and lying to the ppl that it is a vaccine for covid19. They are evil incarnate and have been planning this for decades.
2383	111050	@latimes yes this is true, i've shared meeting minutes from 2019 -conversations about coronavirus. how deadly it'll be - how it will spread - and which pharma will make the tests and vaccine. True - but no-one listens to me because they've meen hated too. BUT I been warning since AIDS hit
2384	110870	..This will go on, Mandates on masks first, mandates on the covid19 vaccine to attend school are already in place in some states for instance my own, now do we want to talk about a cashless society too?
2385	108526	You know I haven't seen this answered in the news. Are we going to have a #COVID19 vaccine shot every year just like the flu?
2386	202228	How did I ring in the New Year???... oh you know, vaccinated about 45 first responders... and a couple of my School Nurse friends/colleagues.. and, got my first Covid-19 vaccine! https://t.co/X8zBLxXQrx
2387	111374	@PhilOSo86839856 @RealJamieKay No I can't. However I know my husband  who also caught it and my GP know.  I stated a fact. I couldn't care less if you believe me or not but the fact is, you can spread Covid-19 even if you are double vaxed, my immunity will last a year, your vaccine will need 2 boosters a year.
2388	112360	The gap between countries who can &amp; can’t afford vaccines is growing every day. Vaccinating everyone, everywhere is our only way to be free from the #COVID19 pandemic. Tune in now for this once-in generation festival.
2389	111161	@PhRMA Decades of research that have never produced a viable vaccine for a coronavirus.  Thanks, but no thanks.  I’ll take my chances.
2390	111673	Great news to wake up to this morning. Britain has authorized the first COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, making it the first country in the world to do so. The U.S. and others likely won't be far behind.
2391	202376	“The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall have had their first Covid-19 vaccinations,” @ClarenceHouse spokesman. #vaccine #covid
2392	111624	$GRTS damn 100 days is fast, but the world is in dire need and I have faith CEPI has what it takes and what a partner in this stage of the game for @gritstonebio @CEPIvaccines @NIAIDNews it doesn’t get any better than this kind of collaboration team..
2393	110841	So maybe don't take the vaccines if you have diabetes or a peanut allergy or are female or whatever's on next in the Great Warped Speed Fiasco.
2394	108664	Malone contracted COVID-19 in February 2020, and later got the Moderna vaccine in hopes that it would alleviate his long-haul symptoms. It is people like her we will never get over this virus.
2395	111025	@Newsweek Does anyone really know how effective this vaccine is will it last 30 days 6 months or even 1 year in your immune system will you actually not get the coronavirus
2396	111405	How is this not going SUPER viral?They just admitted vaccines are worthless. @benshapiro Unpack this please
2397	107901	#COVID19 I will not be surprised if we have been told to take the vaccine 3 times a year, yep ones every 4 months. taking something that is so useless against any mutation.
2398	202378	I’ve even considered getting a pneumonia vaccine. But I’m going to talk to my doctor first. I’ve had pneumonia more than most people in my life (last one was about 14 years ago). So I’m considering it anyway. TBD. Gonna talk to my doctor first.
2399	109800	While we're on the topic of fat-phobia, who can tell me if fat people were included in any of the wildly successful COVID-19 vaccine trials? Cuz what you're NOT gonna do is give us a vaccine that's only made for thin people. (yes, there are precedents - like Plan B)
2400	109947	||• So tomorrow my writer is going to get the Covid-19 vaccine shot at around 12:45pm. So glad I don't have to work tomorrow.
2401	112462	@ChrisSprowls @RepMikeGrant @GovRonDeSantis #republicans are supporting an insane president #trump who is blocking YOUR #covidreliefbill  YOU will get NO #VACCINE , NO #UNEMPLOYMENTBenefits No aid for #hospitals #FrontLineHeroes NO #stimuluscheck They let #covid19 spread now they want us homeless and starving #COVIDrelief
2402	110618	@CDCgov What I have to inquire about is not the testing. I’ve heard pneumonia is what actually makes everyone so sick with covid19. If that is true why can’t potential victims of the virus get the pneumonia vaccine? I have COPD and no pneumonia since taking that vaccine.
2403	108123	There are certain problems with the Sputnik-V vaccine (this is the one being administered in the private sector). Details mentioned below:
2404	112923	Just a reminder, the rest of the  world is working together on developing a vaccine against #covid19 and the US is not included because they don’t trust Trump.
2405	107889	"This person thinks Anthony Fauci holds a patent to the Covid-19 vaccine, and is withholding for ""reasons""Their opinion on anything, from the price of tea in China, to the solution to 2+2 is invalid.If they get something right, it's by happy accident, the brainworms ate the rest"
2406	108418	@DavidBe53174057 Lower respiratory instead of upper respiratory.Causes deadly to humans immune responses, mini blood clots in internal organs,blood thickening resulting in organ failure.May trigger body's immune system to attack brain cells. No vaccine for any coronavirus.
2407	107678	@videogamedeals So you’re saying all you get is a sticker when they give you the T-virus?🧟🧟‍♀️#bogus #CovidVaccine #covid19 #ResidentEvil
2408	201994	Got my #flujab todayOne of the joys of being immunosuppressed.Hopefully the next jab will be the #COVID19 vacine
2409	108701	One problem with this plan is that the Indian Serum Institute (like our FDA) hasn’t issued an EUA for any of the COVID-19 vaccines manufactured in the U.S., so none can be administered there yet. The SII has approved Covidshield, based on the AZ vaccine, but not quite the same.
2410	109849	“Vaccines for the coronavirus is a frustrating subject. It could take a year, or 18 months to develop a successful vaccine for #COVID19. Most importantly, we want to creat a vaccine which can actually worked”
2411	107712	@FEDERMCF @FaheemYounus Exactly thatviscwhatcI am saying.I am unstupid enough to know facts such as...Vaccines have ingredients highly dangerous for the nervous system such as formaldehyde etc. Do you even know what is in your vaccine?Do you know Bill Gates owns the pattern for Covid19 (Phirbright)?
2412	111520	@EWoodhouse7 And THIS is why no one has been able to develop an effective coronavirus vaccine in decades!  Masks don’t work- vax doesn’t protect.  Let’s go back to the main truth- virus is gonna virus
2413	111968	No vaccine for HIV after 40 years of research.No vaccine for the common cold.￼No vaccine for cancer after 100 years of research. A virus mysteriously appears and within a year a vaccine is created and we are all expected to take it.Not. Happening! #COVID19
2414	110857	Okay normally this would be funny but this is just going lead to more not taking the vaccine and the longer we going have to deal with the pandemic.
2415	109441	February 25: “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.”  February 25: “I think that’s a problem that’s going to go away… They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we’re very close to a Vaccine.”??
2416	109645	So informative and interesting. Take any vaccine your offered, they are all effective and will help to protect against #COVID19
2417	110253	@HeidiWhitaker @POTUS What will they do. Arrest you if you don’t? They let dangerous criminals OUT of prisons to protect them from #COVID19 yet they will jail someone for not allowing a forced vaccine?
2418	110469	Why did we go for the cheap and less effective one? Why didn’t we go for the Phizer vaccine?Australia isn’t a poor country. But LNP members have stocks in Astra Zeneca so I guess their finances are more important that Australians, right Scomo?#auspol #ScottyFromPhotoOps
2419	108250	lol there it is, the deal with modernathe company who has never made a vaccine before yet is charging the highest price for a CV19 vaccine, all while insiders dump stock at unprecedented levels on the heels of their vaccine news driving up it's price
2420	109900	I have heard this same message 100s of times and my stance on taking the vaccine hasn't changed but now my football team says it that's totally going to change my opinion

2422	109153	Accept this fact that historically it took avenge 11 years 2develop a vaccine. Secondly gene based technology is new with no proven history so it should take more time then normal technology. Otherwise vaccines will take more life’s then #coronavirus @NileshShah68 @VijayKedia1

2424	112275	@TeemoCarry @KeenwaAcai @DrEricDing They have clearly said they aren't injecting part of the virus like they have done in the past that can cause these reactions. You're assuming things with no proof. I rather have the vaccine with its very low chance of side effect to getting the Coronavirus with no vaccine
2425	110830	@GorillaSIX @uk_domain_names as in there is no approved vaccine yet...Not for SARS1, not for MERS and not for RSV...all 3 are coronaviruses that we have lived for a long time already...all 3 can cause pneumonia...and neither of them a vaccine...so COVID19 is treated like a VIP
2426	111578	@newsmax I know people who don't agree with getting the COVID-19 vaccine, but the politics they like &amp; listen to are saying we need to get a COVID-19 vaccine. And so those people are now saying we need to get a COVID-19 vaccine just because the politics they like &amp; listen to are saying it

2430	108612	This legit sounds like satire.Imagine being this stubborn about taking a vaccine when you’re the face of a franchise. Kirk Cousins is showing horrible leadership &amp; judgement; just take the damn vaccine like you did for the measles &amp; chicken pox when you were a kid dumb ass.
2431	112341	I honestly had no bad reaction to the vaccine and I got it while pregnant and my baby is healthy and growing fine. It’s a choice to get it and I don’t judge people who don’t so don’t judge others who do get it.
2432	107925	Why the hell all this vaccine hype, when there is a 100% cure if you catch the flu? Sorry Bill I aint buying your arm poison. @21WIRE The pcr test is also a scam!

2439	112604	As a MA native living in CT, I often complain about the nutmeg state. However, after spending 6 hours helping my parents in MA get vaccine appointments today, I have nothing but pride for my adoptive state.
2440	107878	Mo once again legendary. Called those who don’t get vaccine as bad as his critics (disgusting anti-Muslim bigots who will burn in hell) honestly seems rude to anti vax folks but I respect it.
2441	112896	@Ozzytourer @LucyBattersby Exactly , we have no vaccine yet this will keep happening until we are all vaccinated with a vaccine that protects us from this awful covid19!
2442	108581	@EmilySilver29 @mels_lostagain @ABC7 @lapublichealth Stubborn? I’m looking at the science. Never have we had an effective vaccines against a coronavirus. Covid has animal reservoirs. Never had a vax for this. The current vaxs are not working as we told they would. All factual
2443	109598	Crazy I sure would not volunteer to have one.  to much bad information has come out for me to even having this years flu jab, I would rather have the flu
2444	111100	@FunTimeFred1 Delta variant is a good one! Mutating BENIGNLY towards the cold virus as ALL coronavirus have done since EVER!! This is why corona vaccines are a waste of time and money and why IF safety  trials were completed they wd NOT get to market but hey ho who cares about Vax injury?£££
2445	112254	Will this change MAGAt attitudes toward vaccination??  Things are getting dire and they just don’t care.#GetVaxxed #MaskUp
2446	112679	@willyobina @obera_a @AWICHSAMUEL @ahmednasirlaw You are there comparing a 2019 contagious virus with no vaccine yet to Cancer , Malaria and hunger . Statistics doesn't allow us, factors are independent so please don't compare them. Let's fight covid-19 for now any other fight like ignorance will be dealt wth later.
2447	110842	@Arshathz your POV on this would be appreciated. Kindly enlighten us on how far is this going to be safe &amp; effective over an mRNA vaccine for their second dose? Are there clinical efficacy data for mixing and matching vaccines, such as clinical trials or real-world studies? #lka
2448	111370	@andysmith113as @SuzanneOlbricht @LeftyGlenn @YahooNews Hey redneck... there isnt a vaccine, there may never be a vaccine. The common cold is a coronavirus and theres still no vaccine for it. I'm from NY, I've seen first hand how this virus spreads and what it does to people....
2449	110126	There has never been a successful #mRNA vaccine in human history.There has never been a successful vaccine for human #coronavirus in human history. Correct? Every attempt at both has failed, right?
2450	111299	So, why do we have astra zeneca here if Pfizer vaccine is this much effective. Is this not a set up for Nigeria bayi.#AprilFoolsDay
2451	111084	Oh fabulous,Now the government is pledging our tax dollars to promote a vaccine that is non existent, ineffective for viruses, and probably fatal to kids to nations they think need our help.A little presumptuous, racist, a little demeaning, obnoxious, perhaps @ScottMorrisonMP?
2452	108643	Okay y'all, really? We are going to hoard covid vaccines? This is the moment we all help each other!! THIS IS THE MOMENT YOU RESTORE FAITH IN HUMANITY. Not the moment where you capitalize on this vaccine, over people's lives!!! Just stop, stop, and be human.
2453	109617	@MediaSequitur know the WHO is complicit in this. If you listen and watch the videos very carefully (watch them a few times) what you will notice is that it is an admission that the oral polio vaccine doesn’t work, causes paralysis, and yet they are advertising it anyway. So a COVID19 vaccine
2454	110590	@Intuitive1966 Im curious to know how the vaccinated get on when they catch the actual virus . Will it be fine or create the cytokine storm coronavirus vaccines are known for !
2455	111385	It’s apparently unpopular to say this as a communist, but vaccine mandates are good actually. It’s just a systemic issue where declining one can ruin your life.
2456	111158	@TrueLoserCorp66 @Tama_Rama_SR …&amp; of course, that is impossible, which is why there have NEVER been effective vaccines for any coronavirus. Including, I believe, a common cold. So. This whole thing was a farce from the start. Fauci knew this would kill millions. He’s done it before. Why wouldn’t he do it now?
2457	110418	@Daily_Express Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
2458	110503	i don't get the premise of this. why should we put together the people in danger and risk yet another variant when it is the unvaxxed that are most likely to develop it?also this is essentially segregation.
2459	108740	Either vaccine completion is around the corner or Government has said “Stuff it. Drink lots of beer alcohol kills Coronavirus”. I hope it’s the former.
2460	112166	So apparently I won’t be able to go to the dentist for a while! ....they don’t like it if you travel for work...I guess we need a vaccine to alleviate the #fear #coronavirus
2461	111953	If I was seeing my country wrought by the crisis of coronavirusI would also want my agency to do all it could do to expedite the approvals process for vaccine candidates following their successful trials
2462	108141	can't wait for when the coronavirus vaccine finally comes out so all the antivaxxers get wiped out and the global average IQ goes up
2463	110742	I became suspicious when my own research back in Feb-March told me- boost your immune-system to fight it off if you get it. Then gradually I noticed the media said nothing re.that &amp; big tech was censoring .Why? B/c they  want you to take the fucking vaccine, not be healthy.
2464	112330	"""Anyone in Seattle area want 2 volunteer 4 @UWVirology's trials for a #covid19 vaccine? Plz contact them.  They need participants. I can't participate because I have a """"history"""" of immune-related illness ...  I did want to volunteer.  Researcher in Wuhan confirms it's here to stay"""
2465	111927	We cannot lower our guard. The vaccine will come when it comes, protect when it does. But till then, we rely on ourselves to keep safe.
2466	110774	@notatory871 plus i believe they are also testing if the milder version of COVID-19 makes you immune to the more serious strain thats hospitalising ppl and if thats true then we can either try and replicate the milder strain as a vaccine like you would do with a regular flu vaccine
2467	112220	How is a sitting Senator this fucking stupid?Biden wants everyone to be ELIGIBLE to receive the vaccine by May.No wonder 532,000 Americans have died with morons like this in charge.
2468	112602	Do it. Testing, masks and sensible distancing are the ONLY ways we can get to a reasonable existence, until a vaccine arrives.
2469	111710	@vienna663 @SofiaIb62241242 @business Better vaccine 🤣🤣😂😭They could not create effective vaxx against influenza for years. Do you really believe they can create effective vaxx against #COVID19 #Covid_19 #COVID1984There is saying in Turkish: hope is the bread of the poor 😭
2470	111152	I wouldn’t be comfortable simply because I’m not high-priority; that dose should go to a healthcare worker or someone in a nursing home. I wonder if that’s how people understood the question.I will get the vaccine as soon as it is appropriate for me to do so.
2471	110138	ATTENTION EVERYONE i think my DOG contracted COVID-19 need advice ASAP from a CERTIFIED doctor on how to administer FLU vaccine to dog!
2472	107791	@CDCgov Americans and Canadians need COVAXIN in their arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies.
2473	112066	Want to avoid begging for the vaccine when it's too late?GET IT NOW! It's free! Being intubated in the ICU isn't free. Don't saddle your loved ones with that kind of debt.#VaccinesWork #GetVaccinated #COVID19
2474	201820	@realaveryraquel Oh sh1t 4th!! We will have to ride them out now 90% have jab. Overall death rates are mega low now and in my mind will be for a while. My Phoebe aka Granddaughter  has Covid19 started  first job and gets it at work! No serious side effects though. So fingers crossed for you 2.
2475	108510	tw// covid-19 --i’m begging every single person on this app right now! retweet this or do anything! do not &amp;&amp; i repeat do not get any vaccine for covid-19!! it makes things worse. believe me or not! if you do please be aware of what i’m saying! i love you all
2476	111526	🏠 The PM has announced we must #StayAtHome under a new national lockdown.⚠️ In Eastleigh we are seeing the immense pressure our hospitals are under. We need to stop the spread of coronavirus while the vaccine is rolled out.🦠 If you are out remember hands, face, space.
2477	108755	Anti-Pope Francis has now revealed himself as an anti-Christ.  He says we will not be able to enter Heaven w/out Covid19 vaccine.   This is a direct slap in the face to our Savior Jesus Christ.  It is the mark if the beast from Revelations.  He us EVIL
2478	111682	We will see how many Deplorables willing to be dishonorably discharged there are in the army now that the Pentagon is forcing all military to get the Covid-19 vaccine or be removed permanently from service. If they claim they can't for health reasons they are unfit for service.

2480	112345	This pandemic will not be over until it’s over for everyone, everywhere. I’m calling on @Novavax to pledge their commitment to making sure the COVID-19 vaccine is distributed fairly and equitably around the world. #OneWorldProtected
2481	202413	Day 380437 of being asked if I’d ‘like to add a Covid-19 vaccine frame’ to my fb profile picture. It’s still very much a no.
2482	109317	@FOOL_NELSON HOW do we know that? All the people who had coronavirus vaccine years ago don't have spike protein anymore? Am I confused? Are you confused? It's probably me.😁
2483	110291	This sounds like unpopular opinion but what is so bad about taking the vaccine. Yeah I know it's untested but coronavirus isn't this imaginary disease. What else do you want them to do, wait 10 years to Test it....? We are in midst of worst global pandemic since the Spanish Flu.
2484	112837	".. People1st need to understand what a vaccine is.U cant &amp; Shouldnt ""INDUCE"" HIV  COVID19 Virus in a human's blood to Make th human being 'IMMUNE' to these viruses. What u'd b doing is make th human get INFECTED with these diseases. These viruses eventually grow in RedBloodCells"
2485	107771	It's almost like letting viruses become endemic is a bad idea!Seriously, though, I do hope we get a vaccine for EBV in the near future. Even if it is not causative for autoimmune conditions, it is so often at the scene of the crime that I am definitely suspicious!
2486	111802	This may be a shock but, Mike Pence is lying! @pfizer confirmed they did not work or receive any resources from the Trump administration while working on this vaccine.
2487	110178	Aw bless Pfizer doesn't need to spend advertising budget on this new 90% effective Coronavirus Vaccine (that we don't need) as the Media will advertise it for them free of charge. @LBC is currently dedicating whole hour to it even telling a student caller who it should go to 1st
2488	109453	If we weren't supposed to get coronavirus, virologists never would have let it out of their lab.We don't get influenza vaccines, yeah? Did you get your flu shot? Probably not. What's next? Government mandating influenza shots? Shit's been spreading since 1919.
2489	109699	@MarkJagielski The Chinese created this Covid-19 Virus themselves, are they too stupid enough to create an effective vaccine for it?
2490	109726	People need to be damned patient. We've only waited 9 months for a vaccine, which is extraordinary. I've already accepted it probably won't be my turn until Summer 2021. #WearAMask  #WearADamnMask
2491	111838	Only Science will eventually deliver a solution to the Covid-19 pandemic. A vaccine or a cure. Praying, fasting, singing will not help us in any way. Fairytale religions will not help us in any way#Covid_19 #TBJoshua #ScienceMatters
2492	112647	And then they'll say you have to get this little vaccine by Bill frigging Gates to keep your job.... Wake up people....
2493	110264	"(3/5) I mean that makes no sense? Who wants to be shot up five times a month with coronavirus vaccine, and I will say it again, you don't know what kind of ""stuff"" they are putting in that vaccine, and then it goes into your body and wreaks havoc?"
2494	108194	How COVID-19 vaccines workA visual explainer on how vaccines work, including how they work with the body’s immune system and their use in preventing coronavirus.
2495	112703	@John33840251 Stop posting shit like this. Ppl will get scared and abandon their pets. Coronavirus is a feline/canine threat and they have vaccines for it. It is NOT the same Coronavirus as COVID19. It's a different strain. Better to delete this crap cause it's FAKE NEWS.
2496	109386	The WHO warn that there may never be a vaccine for Coronavirus. Is Nippy going to keep Scotland shut down for ever more?
2497	109701	This is actually genuine.Heroism requires courage by definition. Are they suggesting taking a COVID19 vaccine is dangerous? Is this an unintentional revelation?
2498	111797	"Booster number 15?This is never gonna end.This is why mandates and waiting for ""no new cases"" is insane.It's all about power, they keep taking and taking and they'll never give those freedoms back."
2499	112371	"@charlesmurray 2. Because after the two months of clinical trials of the vaccine, there was only a 1% difference in mortality in those who took the vaccine and those who took a placebo.  Because covid19 is 99% survivable for most people, then this 1% ""edge"" to survive covid19 is very very low."
2500	107730	If it's due to antibodies, that's one reason, however, if this is not the case and someone could get this over and over, there goes the idea for a vaccine and the entire world is on lockdown for two years until it all goes away.
2501	202358	Fantastic service at County Hall today. Thank you so much to all the staff who helped me get the booster/4th dose for CEV. It’s such a relief to finally get it. Everyone was so kind and helpful - what an amazing service!
2502	111304	just heard someone (an employee) at serramonte tested positive for covid19 so good thing i’m not an idiot and going out to malls when there’s still a global pandemic with no cure or vaccine going on
2503	201889	Schedule my child's first COVID-19 vaccine shot and my third for the same day today! #vaccinated #kidsvaccine
2504	109437	@boomkj @atensnut @AprilRain100 @MedCramVideos So the no lose situation is that we fear God, we don’t fear death, and we can pray that Lord willing, they develop an effective vaccine. But it’s difficult. There is no effective vaccine for the flu virus. And unfortunately we see COVID-19 changing and mutating as well...
2505	111310	Make no mistake!As long as a covid19 vaccine isn't found in the so-called saner climes, @WHO may well not okay it! Take it or leave it.I'm not a scientist, but whatever is in those Madagascan bottles, even if it cures a million people a day, won't make sense to @WHO,
2506	111345	@DC_Draino They’re pushing back so hard on this because they don’t want to work if there’s an effective treatment out there for COVID-19 and they can’t force out a vaccine.
2507	109450	@MillerMattu @GOVUK @scotgov I’ve no idea, but sacking healthcare staff because they won’t take one of these injections is ridiculous though, they’ve been in amongst coronavirus and covid for 2 years, I’m sure their naturally acquired immunity is far better than what the vaccine offers

2509	109101	@RichardGrenell @realDonaldTrump If only we all had an army to shoot and gas our peaceful detractors, we could all feel safer coming out of hiding in our liddle bunkers. Oh, except there’s no justice in America. And, no vaccine for Coronavirus. And, no PPE. And, no leadership in the White House.
2510	111234	@AllisonLCarter Most are not anti-vax. They are anti-mRNA which they don't trust the technology which has no long term studies in humans. There also has been no successful Coronavirus vaccine due to ADE or the Common Cold would have had one. These are therapeutics as you still spread the virus.
2511	109345	@denise_dewald I would get a COVID19 vaccine in my eyeball every week if it meant we could end the pandemic
2512	112036	@Norma09 @Just_a_fox_ The COVID-19 vaccine has no mechanism for causing the virus because it contains no virus.
2513	110023	.@GovWhitmer just called for a vaccine that is free and safe for all. Sounds good to me, eh @uaem?#Drugprices #COVID19 #DemConvention2020
2514	111330	@scoot3r83 Given what we already know about covid I think there is sufficient data to say the vaccines are “relatively safe and effective”. Far from perfect but a great tool against covid19 and it’s complications. As for mandates, I don’t think they’re a good idea. No one should be forced.
2515	111671	And in the wealthy countries people decline the #vaccine. They laugh in the face of covid til they are hooked up to their very own ventilator - #getyourshot
2516	110352	Remembering in 2007 when Gov. Perry mandated a vaccine for girls to prevent HPV and realizing there is no at the wheel in the mansion these days. A goat could do this job. It would just eat any ideas places in front of it.
2517	108381	@joimonki @lara_bolivar @nytimes I don’t remember anyone needing a polio vaccine every three months - bad comparison. Also animals do not get polio, but some do get Covid-19 -meaning we might always have an animal reservoir.
2518	109696	Please, everyone, keep wearing your #facemasks This is madness! #COVID19 #COVIDBooster won’t solve it all. Ugh 😩
2519	107864	#vaccinationCovid #CovidVaccine ive been largely shielding since March 2020. Ive been balancing the risks of my kids continuing to go to school because if their specific needs, my work requirements and the serious risk covid-19 has over me. I know some of my BME/BAME followers
2520	109539	I just don't care if I get baned censored or whatever you want to do I will never get the covid19 vaccine I have had covid19 last year and I am still alive and well at 60 year's old I feel great,stop the lies .
2521	111684	Yes, In a very courageous step he forgot to place an order for vaccines. Those alive may win, the dead has lost it forever.

2527	112322	@Cleavon_MD No obstetricians I know are recommending the Covid-19 vaccine for pregnant women. Just as they have not approved the vaccine for 0 thru 12 year olds. I am very sorry this beautiful woman died. We know nothing about her medical history, and it is not our business.
2528	111692	Ordinary developed countries strive to produce their own vaccines against coronavirus infection.However, Japanese only think about buying foreign-made vaccines.The Japanese do not consider increasing the burden on vaccine-producing countries.
2529	108648	Indeed. These are the numbers that a longer process would cover, hence the rapidity that many feel fearful about.When my turn comes around, I’ll be having the vaccine:to protect my loved ones &amp; those who cannot have this.#COVID19Vaccine Such an incredible achievement.
2530	111043	@WideAngle_ @BreitbartNews Biden's coronavirus advisor Zeke Emanuel (Rahm's Brother) wants Biden giving out the vaccine to China and Everyone Else. While those in The US get the vaccine last it's how insane Liberals are.

2536	110533	2/4  In a world with anti-vaxxer numbers rising, we desperately need to: A) make sure any COVID-19 vaccine WORKS and is SAFE; and B) convince people to TAKE it. So what does someone as Ascientific and just plain stupid as DumpTrump do?
2537	108728	@LauraRbnsn Listen: God sent the coronavirus plague to punish this sinful world, fully knowing that scientists would seize the opportunity to implant the Mark of the Beast in the vaccine and distribute it to the Earth's population, paving the way for Antichrist just so... I'm exhausted  😫
2538	111167	A year ago, you couldn’t even mention this without getting censored, banned or deplatformed. Just think what will be uncovered next year about vaccine safety. Tick tock.
2539	108857	#Covid19VaccineReport Don't just accept the vaccine because they say so. Find out what it is all about because you are still not safe after been vaccinated. Be wise
2540	108280	Every person that breaks lockdown rules and those that repeatedly do so whether fined or not...should be a the last to receive any COVID-19 vaccine! They obviously believe they are immune or simply don’t care so they should be given to those who respect this virus! #covid19

2544	111211	The anti-vaxer nonsense on Social Media is getting out of hand. Ignorant people undermining the brilliant work done to develop  #CovidVaccine so quickly. Already encountered this on Twitter today before seeing this
2545	111541	Tier 0 is the new normal...Remember people the flu is a coronavirus and there is a vaccine ... guess what? The flu is still around.Lockdowns are not because of a virus! A virus so deadly you need to have a test to know you have it...which can still be false 🧐
2546	110400	@rheumacademy Is Covid-19 Vaccine SAFE for Pregnant Women ? ? ? HELL NO !!! Don’t you dare sign that paper unless you can prove 100 % there are absolutely NO BIRTH DEFECTS. (Testing will take 9 months plus 2 years) We don’t want any COVID BABIES.
2547	112868	my question is, how do we actually know if they are getting “the vaccine” and not water or some other shit instead
2548	109766	@ethanndg @Nlechoppa1 to cause that's what they want you to. People who have taken the COVID-19 Test, were healthy and after they took the test, then ended up positive with the Virus. The COVID-19 vaccine ain't a vaccine. It has a chip in it. That's why Bill Gates is tryna make it a Cashless society.

2554	110712	If it's not confirmed that already having COVID19, doesn't mean you won't get it again, why are some places trying to implement this antibody testing in order to get off of house arrest &amp; go back to work? Why would a vaccine help if the real virus doesn't give you immunity?
2555	107869	Apparently, No vaccine is going to be rolled out for the Coronavirus for at least the next 18 months? This is getting scarier by the day. 😌
2556	110340	People itch for like “positive coronavirus news” and maybe my head is just fucked now but literally none of it makes me feel even slightly better it all looks exactly the same. Only news I will accept is “quarantine lifted” or “working vaccine created”

2559	112753	I'm confused by all the different dates, and whether they mean the whole vaccine or half the vaccine. I guess the deliberate confusion is to help to continue with spreading herd immunity and fleecing the taxpayer? #Marr

2561	108474	@ding_gang Malaria huh? I’ve had my malaria shot and booster (the booster is a hum-dinger) I’m inclined to not believe this since a US Navy ship has #COVID19 and all sailors are inoculated for malaria in boot camp.
2562	110481	When a job trys to make you get the covid-19 shot saying its a requirement for the position but you got some for they ass 😭😭😭 … I went &amp; got a doctors out saying I cannot get the vaccine . Ion even play like THAT
2563	109062	Thanks to everyone who's spoken up and called for an advanced vaccine rollout. Now starting in February. #COVID19vaccine
2564	110699	i’m honestly so so fed up of people thinking they’re scientists when they’re just not Highlights include:- why is no cure for cancer when we got a vaccine for covid-19 -covid-19 is just another flu -masks are filled with bacteria that will make us ill
2565	107839	@JaggerMickOZ The vaccinated don’t realize the Delta variant they’re getting now is weaker than the original Wuhan COVID-19 strain. They assume the vaccine is why it’s not worse. Wait until a new full strength variant hits this winter. I think that’s when the ADE will really kick in.
2566	110581	"I mean, it might work as a sales pitch. ""All y'all nakers are gonna die! The racist COVID-19 is genocide! Now get this vaccine!"""
2567	112105	First dose of the covid19 vaccine is now in my body. My arm hurts like someone punched it, but otherwise doing good!
2568	111469	Why are we not surprised. How can you possibly have a proven, fully tested and safe vaccine after only 7 months? What about the long term side effects, does anyone have a clue on that one? Doesn’t make any sense.
2569	109184	I would happily continue to live like a hermit until there is a vaccine if it means my son can start kindergarten on time in the fall.
2570	108707	People want to know what is in a #Covid19 vaccine, but they don't even check what they eat or drink. They swallow pills like they are nothing - and they don't even check ingredients. You know why? Because they wouldn't know what E171 means. But yeah, go on with your stupidity.
2571	112831	There is a cabal negatively smearing this and azithromycin in combination because it’s inexpensive.  They want expensive vaccines big money
2572	109496	@Tom_Fowdy Because it's a smart (though shady) thing to do. Only time will tell which vaccine trials work out and which fail. ESPECIALLY when there has been no successful human vaccines for a coronavirus yet developed.Not saying they DID it, only they have good reason to. Same for the US.
2573	110523	Looks like Oxford has the best chance at a vaccine then, they can increase the antigen count quite a bit unlike other phases 3 vaccines that are currently being tested.
2574	202135	I’m not a doctor but I’ve seen people acting sceptical of the vaccine over this so I’ll give my opinion. My dad got vaccinated and his arm was sore like when u get a flu shot. It probably isn’t something serious. I kinda need your arm not to be sore to play baseball
2575	111861	Can we get paid to get every vaccine from here on out? So can checks be sent to us for prior forced vaccines. My state is paying 100/person for Covid-19 vaccine. Lol so can we make that a paycheck for 100/vaccine since birth. Also every time we get the flu vaccine too. Lol!
2576	111004	When are they going to admit the vaccine does not work . And it looks like the vaccine gives you covid .
2577	110565	@SChad71593015 They never were able to develop a coronavirus vaccine. And when they tried back in the early 2000's all the lab animals died!
2578	108761	also the essay is about coronavirus vaccines and it’s actually cool as fuck so i’m here purely to ask if anyone would be interested in a thread about current corona vaccine research and how different types would work?
2579	112383	@WHO @Sophie_Mokoena @DrMikeRyan Q: Can I stop wearing my mask after being vaccinated?A: No. We don't have proof that vaccines protects you against Covid19. You can still get infected and infect others after taking the vaccine.
2580	112090	@hrkbenowen It will be a winter of joy!  The vaccine in itself is an infection of the cells, just like a virus infection.  It goes into the nucleus and instructs the cells to replicate a foreign body; that being the covid19 spike, a virus component!  Wish the vaxxed luck!  They'll need it.
2581	111107	@waffaisback @dona17_mc They’ve actually been working on a coronavirus vaccine for a decade.  They just finally got funding to have the resources necessary to complete it.
2582	112361	@RobertEarnsha15 COVID19 is no better or worse than every other strain and every other virus or cold. If a vaccine is nothing but a small amount of the virus to allow me body to get over it, then I'll do the same on my own
2583	201854	That second covid-19 vaccine is starting to kick in. Feeling fatigued and some arm soreness, but it’s worth it.
2584	107760	I pray that these seniors families don't allow this to happen. This is extremely dangerous. Nothing is even known of this so-called Covid19 vaccine. The article gives no details concerning it.
2585	111812	They’re going to inject 100m Americans with Dr Trump patent snake vaccine days before the election? Or just announce it and hope it’s enough to win him some votes before people work it it’s a hoax? Either way everyone involved is a danger to the public
2586	112917	@POTUS @DeptofDefense - ENOUGH!  - make it a requirement while serving - we all had to get measles, polio, &amp; other vaccines to eradicate diseases and protect everyone.  This is no different.
2587	109295	There are millions of people around the world without access to any COVID-19 vaccines and they would kill to get one. Meanwhile Americans are going to continue to get sick and die this year because they think they are smarter than a virus. SARS-CoV-2 is endemic. It’s here to stay
2588	112365	No Vote No vaccine. This is business. So only in Tamil Nadu BJP is competing with Nota 😂. Never ever seen such a fool PM 🙏
2589	111895	@pfizer company has developed #COVID19 vaccine. Interesting fact is that Pfizer is the who invented Viagra. So, Whoever have consumed Viagra can tell that how effective this vaccine will be. Is there anyone?
2590	108946	@Minapina7 I hope so, because Iran is not far from my country, but after the issue of the Coronavirus has ended and I have taken the vaccine so that I am allowed to travel...
2591	112424	Please be a hero and volunteer to test for a coronavirus vaccine. You can’t get coronavirus from the trials. It’s not a live virus. I would volunteer but there’s not a location near me. Check this out, please.  https://t.co/sD1qvlgb6R
2592	111903	These are the industries that @MassGovernor is destroying w/ his phased opening plan. Is it any wonder MA has the highest unemployment in the country? Big box stores never closed, meanwhile no parades until a vaccine. It’s nonsensical.
2593	109205	•The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is reported to be effective against the Kent strain of coronavirus, according to the Chief Investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial.
2594	108273	#COVID19 is not going to go away. It is something that will have to take its natural course and become a normal virus in our ailment pool, just like the flu. We cannot be contained to our houses until a vaccine is released to the public, in an estimated 12 to 18 months.
2595	111965	This is how coronavirus in feline (FCoV) looks like ☹️ Before we freak out, it cant be transmitted to human. Cats infected usually wont survive, it is currently untreatable. I only have seen vaccine for CanineCoV. Truly sorry for your loss.
2596	108022	@tractorbadger @LukeJohnsonRCP @Paulrichardsmig No it isn't going well for them. Not at all. But with foreign aid and known cures and preventive jabs they don't need to.Ask yourself this simple question.If COVID-19 isn't that bad because they have 'statisically lower numbers'Why has the planet locked down?
2597	108508	WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TWITTER CENSORS JABBERING ABOUT? NOTHING ABOUT THIS TWEET NEEDS CENSORSHIP YOU MORON MARXISTS. OH, JUST GROW UP. KEEP THIS UP TWITTER AND YOU WILL BE THE MY SPACE OF THE 2020's ●
2598	109118	@KelvinBSP @johnpilger There's no such thing as a safe vaccine. They are never tested in double blind studies &amp; the covid 19 virus has not even been isolated let alone tested. Everyone has coronavirus in their system, the name for all flu viruses. Tests for the virus are not accurate.
2599	110048	Seeing how easy it still is to get head or pussy on the street.... Vaccine or no vaccineCoronavirus gonna be staying here for a while

2601	108061	I gotta get the other covid-19 vaccine 💉 to go the Forbes summit I’m so mad but i want my goals and dreams
2602	107727	@Pippov66 @GeorgeMonbiot That’s why vaccine equity is so important. The WHO has said that the whole world should have access to COVID-19 vaccines so we call all work in unison.
2603	111637	@funder Is it possible to gather some bats and study them? Why isn't there a bat specialist working on a covid19 platform? Go to the source. Find out why bats can carry their own vaccine and humans can't. A human  cannot handle viruses from bats but humans are larger in size.
2604	110089	in ireland we need to face up to the sad but true reality that #COVID19 is not going to stop till be have a vaccine but we can slow it right down and unfortunately a lock down is the olny way to do this there is no other way. We all know it as we need to wake up to fact that some
2605	107695	Being in law enforcement means following the rules. So why are police unions telling their membership not to comply with vaccine mandates? COVID-19 is the #1 cop killer in the nation. It. Makes. No. Sense.
2606	202113	Can’t get  my head around this .... they got a vaccine for the #coronavirus but still waiting years and years for a vaccine for one for #cancer
2607	111760	So we have been told we are getting our vaccine in July. Will it work then on the new variants. Or will covid be gone by then? Why do I need it then?
2608	107888	Well this is an option for us.. With My ASD daughters needle fears this will make our day a shit ton easier when we go in for our Covid vaccine.
2609	111227	Is my opinion that covid-19 influenza in disguise and now you've created this vaccine that we already had in my opinion

2615	110065	Yay! I got my appointment today to come and get my photo opp with one of the vaccine fridges. No-one must be inoculated until all the PR shots are complete.
2616	112449	My hospital system is requiring the COVID19 vaccine for all employees and I'm extremely glad they're doing this. I don't understand how some of my coworkers work here every day and still refuse the vaccine.
2617	110665	Joe is not only a real fraud but also a murderer, otherwise how could he possibly project anything like that, when there are advanced treatments/drugs; vaccine&amp; fast testing, can you enlighten me how? Of course the answer is: more fraud, just make up the data, right?
2618	111831	@carolecadwalla @globalhlthtwit You get no immunity from a coronavirus, but the vaccine does? This seems counter intuitive to me - what am I missing?
2619	110866	@htTweets @narendramodi No one knows what vaccine does.No one has guts to say vaccine is useless. For Ayurved medicines you are asking for data.Where is data for these vaccines.And if virus is mutating, will vaccine work? Show proof.#TikaUtsav #COVID19 #coronavirus @ndtv @aajtak @zeenews
2620	112521	@AbundantLandUse @jjhorgan @adriandix One California Vaccinologist has said if he wanted to do an experiment to test COVID19 ability to mutate into vaccine resistant strains, he’d give a sample a half dose or partial immunization, not enough to knock Covid out, just enough to see if it forces adaptation. Well Bonnie?
2621	111015	In my opinion we need to get used to live with “coronavirus” until vaccine is distributed to the population. Our grandparents lived during WWII. They worked, they even had concerts on the field and towns, dinners. It means we can live with corona too. Corona is better than war.
2622	111236	Bought this lovely mask yesterday so when I get my #COVID #vaccine &amp; start going out again, everyone will know that #Lucifer is my favorite show. 💜😈💜I'll #WearAMask until we've got #COVID19 licked. https://t.co/Adi2baOkkw #Lucifans #LuciferSeason5 #LuciferNetflix
2623	111883	@Officialj0nn @LeGoatJames6_23 @BrooklynNets @goatapp @_claxton33 i went to my clinic to take my Covid 19 vaccine but now I’m scared, all the vaccines are gone. Coronavirus star player Russell Westbrick took all the shots. he said “i treat my vaccine like I treat the court, i take all the shots”. Whyyy Westbrick. you built my house last week
2624	109092	@RachaelGreen I agree and the majority of people would. Only 6% in the article said definitely not its a non story, most people would as long as there has been rigourous testing. Whether there can ever be a vaccine for a coronavirus is another debate. Sky news just making news out of nothing
2625	110280	@AdamNutter This doesn't make sense. In what instance would it be mandatory? Someone gets Covid19, either beats it or has to go to the hospital for medical assistance but refuses? Has the flu vaccine been mandatory by law in the USA @RepThomasMassie?
2626	112494	"Just try to get off all the markets emails and social media stuff you'll get from all these ""for profit commercial"" vaccine hubs"
2627	111017	It makes you wonder why Trump and the GOP didn't exploit the creation of the covid vaccine to earn votes, instead they weaponized it against the Dems and made it political. They were in a perfect position to capitalize on it. Why didn't they? #COVID19
2628	108934	@Travistritt Read slowly: When not enough people get vaccinated to reach herd immunity like for the diseases you mentioned, viruses canM U T A T E as Covid-19 did. So the vaccine needs to be check and tested so it can be even more effective against the mutations.
2629	107982	@hmca19 @WPaulJones2 @khangliter @duty2warn It isn't as if Coronaviruses are new, the first human Coronavirus was in the 60s, and a vaccine was developed using much of the research and testing they had done for SARS in 2003. Furthermore, mRNA vaccination is new but not unknown, they have been researching it for decades.
2630	108421	@chrissteinplays @GreatDismal Wait, if we take this vaccine it will not only protect from COVID-19 but taxes as well AND fix my vocal cords and music pitch?!
2631	112561	@southsider35th @molly24742136 @AmyJacobson @ChiPubSchools It’s a simple concept for everyone except right wing extremist fools.  The vaccine greatly improves your chances of not getting COVID-19 or of surviving the virus if you get it.  For anyone with an ounce of common sense that’s a great reason to get the shots.
2632	108750	@CKnorcal @RealCandaceO Actually a vaccine’s job is to prevent you from getting a disease. The COVID-19 vax does not do that do it is hardly a true vaccine. More like a therapeutic. So if you got the shot(s) you can still get sick, though likely not as bad. So not really a vaccine.
2633	108712	@POTUS I got my 1st Covid-19 Vaccine Shot Today (Moderna)🙏🏾Praise God for the Courage to get this done @POTUS
2634	112926	COVID-19 vaccine.   With this low IFR for kids and young adults, why take the chance on a new risky vaccine?  naturally built immunity better prepares the body for the next virus.... and immunity induced by infection is naturally selective resulting in lower HIT
2635	111739	@hrprogressive @edyong209 um... it is a coronavirus with animal reservoirs.  there are no sterilizing vaccines, and there never will be. it is NEVER GOING AWAY.  EVERYONE WILL EVENTUALLY GET IT.  if you aren’t old or fat you’re more likely to be struck by lightning than die of Covid.  really. Do the math.
2636	108386	Now that we have open borders and people coming into our country from all over the world bringing coronavirus-19 with them.  So now will they take the vaccine meant for USA citizens? Then will we be locked up in our homes or studio apartments for another year?
2637	109474	My mom getting her covid-19 vaccine really has me in tears this woman deserves the world for holding it down 😭
2638	107935	@TONYxTWO It actually isn't a vaccine it is just a flu shot with strains they guess are going to be around that year. The covid19 vaccine will end up being the same thing, a shot. A vaccine is not needed every year. Just their way of making money and injecting shit into you, possible chip
2639	201876	This is so sad 💔My uncle in his 60's got a blood clot in his leg after the jab... Had to have his leg amputated below the knee. 😢
2640	111798	This past year has made me into more of soulless human robot than ever before, but there's something about my primary care patients who have survived the Khmer Rouge/ Cambodian Genocide now getting their COVID-19 vaccine in our clinic that gets me a lil emotional.
2641	108555	Not sure why it’s not being reported much but the Coronavirus has been found to have mutated in Denmark and would make ALL current trial vaccines worthless.
2642	109857	"""Govt may impose sanction on persons who refuse to take coronavirus vaccine – Oppong Nkrumah"" You dont have what people are deemed to be refusing. procure it first, and let all above 18 take the jab, the malady doesn't know who a citizen is or an illegal resident is."
2643	111038	So did I get that right? The fellow in the control group dies after being injected with the existing meningitis vaccine (supposedly safety tested) and already on the market? and they've bypassed the double bling gold standard altogether. Nice.
2644	108559	#COVID19 mutation found in Denmark. Evolved in mink and transferred to people. This new mutation is immune to the future vaccine - so now all 15 mio mink in Denmark has to be euthanised. This was not on my 2020 bingo card #CoronaMutation
2645	107966	@Aiims1742 @apoorva_nyc I feel terrible for the Capitol grounds staff that had to clean up the mess they left behind. Hopefully everyone working on Capitol Hill has gotten a COVID-19 vaccine, but I doubt it. There's no doubt that the entire Capitol Hill complex is teeming with COVID-19 now.
2646	111651	So SARS-COV2 has mutated beyond the previous strains. How in the hell is a vaccine the world's developing now going to be effective against these new strains😢🙄
2647	109185	I'm not vaccinated &amp; don't plan on it. That is my personal choice because I'm healthy. My immune system is good however if I had chronic illnesses that effected the COVID19 if I got it I would do the vaccine! I don't promote it or talk against it. It's a personal choice. MASK😷🎭
2648	108353	What do I do if my employer tries to force me to take a COVID-19 vaccine under threat of losing my job? How do I support my family if I lose my job by refusing?I'm really scared!
2649	201860	Pause so people been dying, getting evicted and going hungry for over 7 months and got ONE check for $1,200 and y’all giving the second one IF we get a vaccine.. as a BRIBE ??? I have no words
2650	108969	@TheScientistLLC If it is so good why he was not vaccinated himself?What could be better for publicity -- Putin is getting publicly vaccinated with Russian #COVID19 vaccine?I guess, Putin is not so sure how well does it work or even tolerated.

2655	108048	@1stnamenumbers @JustATh27580793 @MLive I have nothing against vaccines, in fact all my kids are vaccinated. I'm just against a vaccine when the premise is: you NEED it to protect them when 99.999479% of kids ages 11-younger (ineligible to get the COVID-19 vaccine) have all survived without vaccine for 18 months
2656	108575	This is insane. Blocking those that want the vaccine?  How does that impact you?  How do we have so many moons in this country

2659	110293	@Paul__Agha @TZ_na_Vijana They are very different and do behave in different ways, however unlike influenzas #COVID19 has no vaccine as yet and it’s seems to be more transmitted than seasonal influenza, nobody has prior immunity and the virus keep us new. Still there is a lot of unknown .
2660	202429	Never been more aware of my privilege than today. So grateful to receive my first coronavirus vaccine #docsforvax
2661	109307	@great_martis @AvidCommentator There has never been a vaccine for a coronavirus. People need to get the idea that we need a vaccine to save us out of thier heads. What happened to swine flu, bird flu, the plague? They aren't with us anymore. Preventative options and contact tracing are key. It'll be over soon.
2662	112352	Because Bill Gates prefers the trials with Africans over using animal testing.  And the African leadership makes them comply.  And they are the first ones to get the actual Covid vaccine when it comes out, as Melinda Gates stated.   They will be top priority.  Eugenics.
2663	110563	Hey...BLM...The Gates have so graciously decided you all get to be vaccinated first! What an honor!! The very people who want to depopulate the planet with the use of vaccines must really like you guys so much they think you should go first! Just a conspiracy theory, right?!
2664	108942	No vaccine in the 224-year history of immunology since Dr Edward Jenner developed the first smallpox vaccine has been developed under such an intense spotlight of media scrutiny as #covid19 vaccine candidates. Previous trials were paused too ... but nobody knew about it.
2665	110513	@porszag @StevenTDennis 1/COVID-19 has mutated into 30+ strains. There’s no way of knowing if a cure/vaccine is developed if it will work on all strains. Even if someone’s been infected with one strain there’s no way of knowing if the antibodies of one strain will protect from other strains. There’s no

2668	111435	Lost another family member to COVID yesterday. Then his wife, distraught and feeling tremendous guilt for telling him not to get a vaccine, took her own life…leaving their two kids behind. Will people PLEASE just get the shot??? #COVID19 #GET VACCINATED
2669	110459	Ok #Delco where are the vaccines? Was told the pharmacy didn't get any deliveries this week. WTAF is going on? We had appts, but alas no shots. #DelcoSucks #COVID19
2670	112483	So even once we all get the vaccine - by this time next year - doesn’t #covid19sk still persist, like a social condition, something to be avoided and never solved, like poverty, or like diabetes - manageable, but never in remission? This was simply #COVID19 Year Zero.
2671	108334	Watching @JustinTrudeau press conference - what is the obsession with the US and the response in the past. I, and my family and friends, want to know if a vaccine is being worked on? How close? What are the steps? Can we have money to pay for food and housing? #coronavirus

2673	110233	yeah idgaf I have trust in our scientists and I’ve gotten every other vaccine my whole life, it isn’t like it’s crazy chemicals it’s just dead virus cells of the coronavirus strain, only reason shots take so long to come out normally is the red tape of getting approved.

2676	109844	To anyone who says they will refuse to get the COVID-19 vaccine I say fine, but then I DON'T think that I or anyone else has an obligation to make any sort of accommodation to keep YOU safe.
2677	110940	To be fair, Europe has it in abundance too.  It is just in the fridge as people don’t want it after the disgraceful scaremongering of Macron, vd Leyen et al.  #vaccine #eu
2678	110329	Exactly. If you’re not sick, you don’t have COVID. The vaccine companies understand this, why can’t  we get everyone else to?
2679	112653	This is America, I am working hard to stop the exportation of any vaccine raw material and our hearts go out to the Indian people. Well, on behalf on the Indians or any human beings that needs help.FUCK YOU USA! You are so fake!
2680	109881	@hellodumbass2 @carrieinparadi1 @faggo4you @RealCandaceO The mRNA vaccine was being developed for years. They only had to adapt it to the Covid-19 strain like they do with the flu shot every year. Don't take it if you don't want to. No one cares.
2681	202131	And the first Pfizer Coronavirus vaccine is in my arm! Thanks #aqueduct and the #nationalguard, the experience was seamless, safe and speedy! I got punched by a jockey, but he’s just cranky bc he can’t race horses right now. https://t.co/81Zl2TKzKQ
2682	110654	This makes sense! The vaccine is supposed to be there to help stop the spread of COVID-19. Though there is not much long term studies done, it is helping to try and get back to normalcy. #UNCWJourno
2683	109404	@ellymelly @rob__angeles @ScottMorrisonMP I told people I would never take the #coronavirus vaccine because it is rushed and they looked at me like I was crazy. I have no problems with taking vaccines but I'm not willing to be a Guinea pig for one
2684	109587	I got my second shot for the coronavirus vaccine my daughter got her second shot from the coronavirus vaccine yesterday and so far so good we both woke up feeling great thank God mind you in 38 years I have not have the flu shot my daughter 16 has not flu since 3 years old
2685	109723	History is being made. We can’t get complacent though. It’s going to be 6 weeks before just this lady is covered by the vaccine.
2686	109650	No origin! No vaccine! This bio virus has features of SARS, and other viruses. After 17years of SARS outbreak, not even one effective vaccine is found. Hydroxychloroquine is not perfect, but saves life! Take down Communist Party of China!
2687	107958	How many will flu kill this winter&amp; will must be separate from coronavirus. Professor Valance said coronavirus wont be eradicate with vaccine &amp; it’s likely to return each yr like flu. To me WHO is problem with coronavirus world wide.
2688	109508	@Matthews_angst If there are only certain vaccines in the world that everyone is being pushed to take against the COVID19 virus worldwide, then there is no such thing as variants.
2689	109439	@rudigr88 @NimblyBimbly420 @BluzPower @Keefito33 @Sally40613367 @paulanoukas you can get it from covid-19 as well, since viruses can cause it. The link to vaccines is just another excuse by anti-vaxers not to get the vaccine.
2690	110856	@alexbhturnbull It's all about the vaccine. Things will never go all the way back to life as we know it until there is a coronavirus vaccine. Until then we are just playing for time and coming up with workarounds.
2691	109492	Correct me if i’m wrong pero i think only pfizer is the only vaccine effective against the south african variant, a variant who’s not only more transmissible but more fatal. Pero pinupush talaga ng gobyerno ang gawang china ano.
2692	111312	Well done @Pfizer_UK, I'll take a vaccine and a packet of viagra for the after party please 😂💉🍆🎉🎉🎉#vaccine #COVID19
2693	111772	Nobody will ever convince me that China didn't engineer the coronavirus as a weapon to be released into African countries to clear space for Chinese agricultural industrialization. They've been grabbing land for decades. It simply got out before they could engineer a vaccine.
2694	202040	I had my second dose Pfizer vaccine yesterday. Got at 2:15pm,  3:30pm start feeling weird at work. 6pm low fever &amp; fall sleep while in zoom class. Very unusual for me to fall sleep like that. This morning wake up with low grade fever, soar throat, muscle aches &amp; chills #COVID19
2695	112234	An oral history of Oxford/AstraZeneca: ‘Making a vaccine in a year is like landing a human on the moon’ - with thanks to @olifranklin @guardianscience and our incredible scientists for the story-telling. #science #vaccine #coronavirus
2696	112223	And the official #flu vaccine outcome is that is has a pretty low efficacy despite being around years. But of course a super rushed #COVID19 #vaccine will sort it out immediately. What could possibly go wrong???!!!
2697	112267	@peter_levy people need to wake up the covid vaccine is not a quick fix!! influenza and it's vaccine has been with us for decades and people have to have a flu vaccine every year the covid vaccine will be no different and coronavirus will never be eradicated
2698	109274	Only in the UK do 5 million asthmatics get told to be extremely careful and to minimise contact with everyone because they are more at risk of Covid19, then a week before their vaccine is due they get told they aren't getting it because not enough asthmatics have caught covid19
2699	112326	The world:We are going to make Vaccine.WHO :Vaccine cant be made,its so damn tough.The World:We will gather funds and start the Research in large scale.WHO : But but but ,vaccine for HIV could not be made ,and vaccine for covid-19 also cant be made.#CoronavirusVaccine
2700	201819	Earlier Today I received my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine during a visit to NIH. When it becomes available to you, don’t wait — get vaccinated. It's safe, easy, and it saves lives. KamalaHarriss  PresidentJoeBiden https://t.co/ifKu1GyGHT

2707	111640	@LauraSavino747 It’s a lot of strange stuff going on in my dreams and lately I’ve been a principal. I keep going back to this school on a hill. The last time I was there kids were being forced to get the COVID-19 vaccine. I remember seeing kids cry total nightmare. I woke up panting.
2708	107886	@HealthZA Want to know more about #COVID19 vaccine is not a silver bullet but intended to provide immunity against the virus? There, I wrote it again for you in @DrZweliMkhize words.
2709	201992	@9NewsAUS @Gabrielle_Boyle It's great news that at least everybody in NSW (Including myself and my carers at Parracare) have had at least one jab of a vaccine against COVID-19 however, there is still a long way to go before we can consider ourselves out of lockdown. I have my second jab on 9th Sept, 2021.
2710	112430	@MollyBeck @journalsentinel It is just plain selfish for 33 yo @AlexanderLasry to get the covid-19 vaccine shot. His excuse is unacceptable. Find a senior citizen. If you don't know any, then you're out of touch.
2711	108931	@nytimes We developed multiple vaccines for COVID-19, but there won't be one for #Trumpism. OTOH, it seems we did achieve herd immunity against Trumpism by Nov. 3, 2020, although many fools still refuse to accept the cure for that, just like many refuse to take the coronavirus vaccine.
2712	111112	Absolutely 👍 They should!! Just like smoker's pay more!! But this is a serious mutant virus that will ONLY get worst if unvaxxed people continue this route..cut the corde to the variant..we all want a safe healthy life too..👇
2713	202395	I was able to get a COVID-19 vaccine appointment for my dad after waiting TWO hours for the confirmation email, because the website was so overwhelmed. My mom, also a 65+ high-risk stroke/diabetes patient, won her vaccine appointment through a LOTTERY. It shouldn't be this way.
2714	109665	It can’t be the racism card 😂. If you’re white and don’t want the vaccine you’re labeled a ment chap ignorant
2715	110731	@joshjob42 @jeffreyatucker I VOTE NO to any COVID-19 vaccine! I will not be taking one for a virus with 98% recovery! The vaccine has more risks than the virus! I would rather contract the virus!!!
2716	107844	Can someone tell me what good the vaccine is then?Also, for those in the back...MASKS DON'T WORK. #Plandemic
2717	110650	@JorgeAMSandoval @mishacollins @Phillip59331183 @nypost No shirts, no shoes, no service. Why is wearing a mask so difficult for people to accept? There are asymptomatic people that can be spreading it. Even after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, masks are still required.
2718	111945	My grandkids have been vaxxed, except the ones under 12, now maybe they can get done too! I hope this goes well, and ALL kids get done quickly!
2719	112857	@ERtravelRN @NPGardener @BaddCompani My brother-in-law said he was sick (the worst he could remember) in January of 2020 so he believes he has already had Covid-19 and believes he is immune and therefore doesn't need a vaccine.  There is LOTS of bad thinking like this out here!
2720	111125	@MadgiePodge @StopNewNormal @triumph07 @JAGLeMans @supernan200 @rowlsmanthorpe @ProfKarolSikora Please look up the history of coronavirus vaccines . They still havent got one for SARS or MERS. And that was how long ago? And they say they knew NOTHING about this virus until december !?!?!
2721	109937	@PonnaarrBJP @BJP4TamilNadu @BJP4India Coronavirus vaccine was found already by our Tamil medicine ancestors.  It's called koraikal keerai ayush vijaya oil by mahamunivar agathiyar (cannabis hemp oil). My party #NTK 184th ward healthcare workshop is making this oil  for all those who are affected by coronavirus. Jaiho
2722	110738	@neiltyson Can you guarantee that a Coronavirus vaccine will be 100% safe and effective for people and there won't be any long term side effects that will pop up 10-20yrs down the line after we take it??
2723	110983	@PeterHu65796484 Paramount they get everyone vaccinated so they will be connected to the smart grid including children (important) so they're controlled in the future. They've just bought more jabs for next year and as the World Bank stated the Covid19 programme continues until 2025. Dark days.

2729	107845	@levy_o Coronavirus cases are not rising. Please stop lying. And why would I get a booster for a two year old virus when I was already sick and vaxed and there might be a better reason to wait for an omicron variant?  We can’t boost every three months.
2730	109655	"Myth: The COVID-19 vaccine was developed to control the general population either through microchip tracking or ""nanotransducers"" in our brains.Fact: There is no vaccine microchip, and the vaccine will not track people or gather personal information into a database."
2731	110463	Not that this is an unusual thing until the last trials are completed, imhao, but WE NEED OPEN SCIENCE!! Especially considering the high vaccine hesitancy in some countries. Hopefully @EricTopol and others will keep speaking up for transparency.
2732	201918	11/ So far, 36 hours after getting shot #2 of the #COVID19Vaccine (@pfizer), the side effects aren’t as bad as they were the first time — mostly just fatigue and slight aches. (For folks who already had #COVID19, we tend to react strongly to shot #1.)
2733	201878	Thumbs up! Received my first #AstraZenaca jab and looking forward the second one in 12 weeks time. Remember, this is a very safe vaccine with an extremely rare risk of side effects. When it is your turn to get vaccinated, please get vaccinated. Together we can fight #COVID19 https://t.co/uyeducO3hT
2734	110034	This is BS, but I've known since the beginning that's how they'd get us to take this rushed and unproven vaccine.If you want your normal back, you need to take it back!
2735	109060	Only snowflake sheep 🐑 subscribe to that bullshit. The strong actually don’t need vaccines. Our immune systems destroy viruses. Vitamin D and vitamin C.
2736	110794	"When asked about getting the Covid-19 vaccine, Biden said, ""I don't want to get ahead of the line, but I want to make sure we demonstrate to the American people that it's safe to take.""He says when he gets the vaccine, he will ""do it publicly."""

2739	111531	@uklockdown @Dr_Ellie The vaccine provide no immunity but reduces the effects of Covid19.It’s better to have immunity given that SARS CoV2 is here to stay. The vaccine provides no immunity whereas my immune system does.Corona viruses mutate hence its preferable to develop immunities as one ages.
2740	110789	the main downside of mRNA vaccines from the point of IP is the fact that once it is out (lipid formulation manufacturing process), it is out forever for any other indications too. It will be end of their exclusivity. So, they will not divulge it voluntarily.
2741	109693	We all need to work together to protect the world from #COVID19. Will @g20org states please step up and release much needed funds for response efforts to @WHO @CEPIvaccines and @gavi? Together, we can beat this pandemic.
2742	108506	This is just straight out gaslighting. I had my flu jab done by a pharmacist last autumn, well before we had ever heard of coronavirus and when Wuhan was just a place my husband occasionally went for work.
2743	111333	I doubt it’s China, the UK or the USA or any country that developed a vaccine or has an agreement with any vaccine distributer.
2744	112587	this is from last week. i wonder how govt will defend lockdown in #ThirdWave #coronavirus #CoronaVaccine #Covid_19

2752	112859	Come on people how do you really know what they are putting into the arm of @Mike_Pence or @JoeBiden as they go on TV to make a big show of them getting a Coronavirus vaccine. It’s probably just saline. people are so gullible they will believe anything
2753	110315	@zacyoga @TimothyPSmith7 @rexzane1 It will be with us forever.  There's never been a vaccine against a coronavirus or the common cold. It is simply science. Just because a vaccine works on something else doesn't mean it will work on a coronavirus.
2754	110929	@AndrewFeinberg Does he seriously think we're all as ignorant and gullible as him?  He.  Did.  Nothing.  They have been working on coronavirus vaccines for years, and really upped the work after SARS.  That's why they make them so quickly.
2755	111724	@Baz4Ppc @FARIAMAL The existence of the new coronavirus has not been proven.It's definitely not a vaccine, as you can't make a vaccine against an unidentified virus.There are various types of existing coronaviruses, and even their vaccines, including SARS and MERS, do not exist.
2756	109790	@ryanlee609 @RationallySassy @JoshuaBeraldo Wanna know a fact. There have been 2 other coronavirus outbreaks in the last 18 years. Neither of them have a vaccine. SARS and MERS are part of the coronavirus family and you're telling me that infecting everyone will protect against the next coronavirus in 8 years?
2757	111191	of course, we are going to find a vaccine that will work 100% against #COVID19. This is what every country is wishing for (some are already making plans). I think no one has talked about plans in case no vaccine will be available. If I am wrong, please send examples?
2758	108136	eh, by a bunch of eugenicists that are trying to thin out persons NOT like them and to get their minions to assist ans stay in line - or else. yeah, it'll be done just like the eugenicists said they would - via the vaccine.

2763	112026	Why would i get the COVID-19 vaccine if it doesn’t stop me from getting COVID-19 or stop me from spreading it? and I will continue to have wear a mask even if I get it.... no thanks.
2764	108751	Swedish media is reporting that a vaccine for Covid-19 might be available already in September, the narrative went from 18 months to 5 months, I don´t trust those energy vampires one bit, I aint having it in my body, rather take my chances
2765	202244	@CeeJaay761 Absolute insanity! Moderna, the NIAID, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill also signed a Material Transfer Agreement for “mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates” just two weeks prior to the emergence of COVID-19… Coincidence?
2766	112759	"Let's stick to what we know: ""...not yet possible to say whether the administration of any vaccine would result in herd immunity in the population, because it was not known how effectively any of the COVID-19 vaccines would stop transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus."""
2767	108410	Your health is not my responsibility.I am not afraid of COVID-19I have the agency to make my own personal health decisions.The harder you push the vaccine on me, the more defiant I become.If you're worried go get the vaccine yourself, stop trying to control me.

2769	110780	People in my area are fighting with other people in grocery stores over wearing a mask. Coronavirus numbers continue to climb. A vaccine is coming but it's going to be a long time before the average person sees it.
2770	202072	So I wasn’t allowed to say anything until today, but I volunteered for the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer. The vaccine was developed in Russia. It’s in 6 different stages and I received my first dose this... MOAR....

2778	201914	My dad and sister got their COVID-19 vaccine today! I feel better about them going into the OR now. My dad changed his mind after he found out his brother, niece, and her two daughters tested positive this week.
2779	109939	Could open above 30k! What has been pointed out is that #Moderna vaccine DOES NOT HAVE to be kept in below zero freezer.
2780	112409	@realDonaldTrump People who already had Covid-19 symptomatically or asymptomatically probably don't need to take any vaccine, since they already have antibodies to the virus in their body.
2781	108369	This bears retweeting.  I lwas really hoping to spend some time outside with my regular friendsgiving peeps, but we aren't even going there.  In 8 months, vaccine permitting, we can party like it's 1999.

2783	109013	@BusinessLiveSA Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines.

2784	110047	Oh heck @SoniaPoulton you're mis-informed. Prof Sarah Gilbert has been working on a vaccine for a human coronavirus for over a decade. I don’t want to ridicule you but I’d urge you to do your research, you could stop someone having the vaccine with this sort of behaviour.
2785	112136	Put the COVID-19 vaccine in Diet Coke or Coke Zero and two things will happen. All these anti-vaxxers will be vaccinated, or they'll boycott and I won't have to drive to three different stores to get them, because these fools keep 10-15cs in their carts.#GetVaccinatedNow

2787	110809	@MarineX @JD_Meadows @laurenboebert LOL. You can't compare statistics for the 1918 flu to the typical flu we have now. Again, a vaccine was developed for it in the 1950's.Actually Covid19 will compare pretty closely to that pandemic. The difference now is there are better health care systems all over the world.
2788	112053	My question it the anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists is this;If #Covid19 and by extension the vaccine is one big made up scenario, what is the end game?Give me a logical answer to that plz.
2789	110998	Just scheduled my appointment to get my 1st Moderna vaccine shot next week. They opened up the age eligibility range to 16 and older today here in PA. I can't believe I can get my Covid-19 shot that soon. #tuesdayvibe #COVID19
2790	109094	I found myself standing just inside the door of a restaurant yesterday to pick up my to go order, when I realized I'd forgotten to put on my mask. I didn't get panic-stricken though, because I've had my Covid-19 booster! I did get my ass outta there as fast as possible though. 😊
2791	110790	Hypothetical question:If you had to choose between being intentionally infected with the coronavirus or taking an mRNA vaccine, what would you choose?
2792	110376	@RichardBulling9 @nanbgood @latimes Yep. We’ve never made a coronavirus vaccine, and the one they tried to make for SARS-Cov1 ended up killing the animal subjects. The virus burned itself out before they finished. It’s unlikely this one will do that. Ive been fretting since january!!
2793	109876	Why is @JoeBiden ignoring the vaccine? Is Joe crazy? What is all this garbage? 1st masks don't work, then they do &amp; now only work with 2 masks. But China Joe apparently thinks none of this works. I guess @JoeBiden rejects science after all.
2794	109383	It fascinates me the inverse logic of these 🤡. It like using alligator repellent in the bathroom and claiming it saves lives. It’s a cold type virus. Everyone gets them and there’s never been a workable vaccine for common colds.
2795	112060	@NHSuk The NHS is lying. The truth will surface. #stayhome  is so you don’t find out their hospitals are empty. They abused care homes. This health service is evil. Do not by any means take the vaccine. There are no #NHSheroes, #coronavirus is a hoax not a conspiracy.
2796	108284	"As per the script. They'll just start calling it flu when a ""vaxxed"" person has it , ""covid"" when they aren't contaminated with experimental gene therapy passed off as a ""vaccine""."
2797	110778	I can't wait to get my COVID19 vaccine.I'm a little concerned how I will personally handle the vaccine. When I got my flu vaccine in 2020 I got a temp of 104.7.That's just me.Please people just take it.
2798	108081	Legit question for my followers. @RepJayapal tested positive for #COVID19 from reckless actions by her Republican colleagues. But didn’t she get the vaccine?  Can someone please help me with this. I’m for the vaccine but this just came to my mind and I’m curious.
2799	112285	This isn’t that surprising and honestly if this becomes like an annual flu vaccine it will normalize getting the shot and maybe more people will be willing to do it.
2800	111907	The pandemic in South Africa right now is not Coronavirus. Petrol prices are going up astronomically tonight which would affect the price of bread, transport, and basic items but our leaders have decided to listen to the UN, WEF, WHO to mandate a vaccine that does not work
2801	108498	Everyone is panicking over this vaccine and posting irrational and fake news on it. Listen to the ACTUAL FACTS. Get the vaccine or don't, but either way please shut up about it. I don't know about y'all, but I'm over this pina colada we are in and I'm tired of distancing #COVID19
2802	201974	Excited for my friends with younger kids to feel the same overwhelming relief I did when my adult children were vaccinated last spring. Where and when Johnson County kids ages 5 to 11 can get Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine https://t.co/i7fb4KbZdt
2803	110543	So the #FDA approved #Phizer #VACCINE, I still wont get it, not enough study done on it, not one person will say how the vaccine reacts with your DNA, my doctor told me I’ve had Covid and I have the antibodies no need for the vaccine, don’t forget #COVID19 actually has a nucleus https://t.co/3i9e7D4duM
2804	107781	You all can can the bullshit now. The vaccine doesnt work, has deadly side effects. You guys are pushisg it too hard. Give it up its a money maker for you guys.
2805	110202	@pmakela1 @ErikRosenberg89 @NickWhithorn @APHClarkson lazinessit reminds me the first outbreak of covid19, when we were dirty and coronavirus was our problem 🙄🙄early 40, started to work in my late 20, going to retire 68, do you still think i'm lazy? i need to be 70 to stop working?we know we need reforms but stop jabbering
2806	109158	No, no! This isn’t happening!!! NO. Not them too. Take the ones who refuse the vaccine, if anyone at all, not those who are naive &amp; innocent, please. Mother Science can be SO cruel sometimes. ❤️‍🩹😞😷💉 Why are we SO dead-set on destroying ourselves? This could’ve long BEEN over.
2807	112747	The only logical explanation is that these fools have the vaccine that’s why they don’t get the rona ..... you gona make me believe otherwise?
2808	110005	@Zackula2 @Sahil58560157 @bodharivoli @DesiPoliticks @kunalkamra88 They didn't mention the placebos.Vaccine Origin_ No dataWHO put up a team of scientists to track the origin of COVID19, but Fattu China, just like fattu @INCIndia , didn't agree 😭😭So don't have blind faith on the Vaccine But _ Prophet_blindfaith_Gaali_Riots_killing_😭
2809	112189	@OffGuardian0 @Deus_Abscondis @PiersRobinson1 @aier That's assuming a coronavirus vaccines will not not very effective. A better comparison is smallpox for which the vaccine is very effective.
2810	112527	@veraciousditto @BrentMa99363117 @MaximeBernier The COVID-19 vaccine is not mandatory in our country...is it?   Maybe I am missing something... I am a moron
2811	111569	Wherever #Chinese vaccine is being peddled, it's where human life is expendable.Vaccines with higher success rate will be reserved for politicians in those countries.
2812	202221	One day be going into space probably, but first to get my Covid19 vaccine passport so won't interfere with the Chinese on other side of the moon. Haha. #space #VirginGalactic
2813	110012	@IamRubberYerGlu @PattyHajdu So what group do you feel are the experts then. The W.H.O ?  The U.N ? Bill Gates ? Fauci ? Are you gonna get in line for the Covid-19 Vaccine. I'm not sure if I am aware of any group of experts that are going the same direction. Please enlighten me so I can do some research.
2814	112272	@billgatesvirus I had all my damn vaccines and I'm fine, I am healthy, even with this coronavirus stuff, legit nothing has happened to me, my family, or friends, or my mom's friends and so on and on
2815	108087	How do we send kids back to school in 6days? As parents we are not boosted and r 9 yr old has one vaccine dose only. Teachers are not boosted. Everyone is in cloth masks? #bced #bctf #bcpoli #covid19bc #COVID19 #OmicronVariant #covidvariant #COVIDisAirborne @VanDPAC @VSB39 @bctf
2816	111778	A white house does not have to take the Jab but once everyone else the reason they want you to take certain Pharmaceuticals to fight covid-19 Congress the Democratic party mix a fortune off of the stock if I'm making you take that back every time they make you do it
2817	107722	@duggo11 @DrAnneMurphy @ciananbrennan @morningireland There is ongoing trials and now real world data too, and if there was none complete they will still be getting the vaccine, I have seeing the effects the common cold has on my child and covid19 will be detrimental to them if the catch it!
2818	107784	So what you want me to believe is that coincidently while they developed the Covid vaccine it just so happens that a second dose and a booster of the same vaccine will work on the original coronavirus? Is that what you think I’m going to believe?
2819	109017	@moes_taverne @Yetta_HH @NDRinfo @ndr They shouldn't even be receiving the jab if they've had coronavirus within a month prior.If they already have it, then they need to let that pass, wait a month, then receive the vaccine. If you vaccinate while someone is already infected, it will not work as intended.
2820	109898	@beebdeaxoru yikes, my parents aren’t anti vaxx but ik some parents who are. omg how does she feel about the coronavirus vaccine?
2821	109885	If you get the vaccine you’re highly unlikely to get Covid, BUT if you do, you won’t show symptoms, BUT if you do they are likely to be mild, BUT if they aren’t you aren’t likely to be hospitalized, BUT if you are you won’t die, BUT if you do… sorry Charlie
2822	108495	So Canada has just approved clinical trials for a Coronavirus vaccine developed by a Chinese biotechnology company. The new (or same old) Steve Jobs business model: if there’s no need for your product, create a need then offer your product as the only viable solution
2823	202384	Just had my first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. Utterly painless. Another step closer to normality. Grateful to be given the chance. https://t.co/rJ6GUkzMjm
2824	109733	Not sure why this is getting so much criticism. Other than it not being available to 🇨🇦 stores (and me not being eligible for my vaccine yet), I think it’s great! It’s one donut. I’m no expert, but good diets include everything.
2825	107932	The vaccine advisors have multimillion stakes in the vaccines???? I’ll brb, going to Lowe’s for my pitchfork.
2826	108670	A beautiful human, donating $1 million so that researchers could develop the  coronavirus vaccine. I love how she wore the perfect shirt for the occasion. #dollysworld, I’m just living in it.
2827	112061	I'm getting the pneumonia vaccine because I had to go and question an overlooked test result and investigate it's bearing on my being infected with CoVid19 in the future. I'm getting a bit cabin feverish.
2828	111135	@Nigel_Farage  you will commit political suicide if you say this about the vaccine. We will not be taking it. No way. Don’t go down that road matey.
2829	108161	"As an unvaxxed person i'm not getting tested or using the joke app. It""s 100% certain i'm not testing positive."
2830	111972	@AlbertzRises @HugoGye Iv had the jab after having coronavirus, I didn't want to but everyone else had so went along with the rest but it didn't feel right.
2831	107967	50% of respondents are in favour of requiring proof of a coronavirus vaccine for “indoor activities such as restaurants, gyms and performances,” while 46% oppose the idea.I guess I'll never go to another restaurant, gym or kids play again.  This is like a dream come true!
2832	111436	@sciencecohen Can you comment on why they have had such great difficulty developing a human vaccine for any of the other 6 or so varieties of Coronavirus, but you're optimistic about this go at SARS-CoV2.
2833	202315	@theAliceRoberts @londoner_007 I am terrified of needles and wince at needles in the dentist etc..I had a nurse call at the door with a flu jab and i did not even know she had done it..literally not even a little scratch..cannot wait for covid19 vaccines so i can end my self imposed shielding.
2834	202181	Just received my first dose of the #covid19 vaccine! Thought it was worth breaking out my new @peatanddiesel t-shirt for, not to mention my Latha Math (good day) beanie from @graficanna.Stay safe, folks. #PfizerVaccine #coronavirusuk #StayAtHome https://t.co/kNQo4k6Fh7
2835	109233	@LeadHatter @Whatsin54282079 @Yishay__Majors @thehill Never said there was but we can’t all develop immunity in the country because of the unvaccinated, and more Americans will die to COVID-19 because they won’t get the vaccine.
2836	108914	@DanPriceSeattle @MalcolmNance Yes, that is true but…the doctors are not always that great, it can take a long time to get in to see one and there is little Covid-19 vaccine but…there is good wine, bread, cheese, and chocolate!
2837	109111	@MildredsSixthC @D3squire @WSJ Here in Australia we are paying people to be part of a medical trial for a covid-19 vaccine; no one is using African's as guinea pigs because it is being done in supervised conditions in first world countries. Stop trying to make this a race issue.
2838	109393	"Sweden has now gone out and said that ""herd-immunity is a myth"" and that only a vaccine can stop the coronavirus.They said just a few weeks ago that they could reach herd immunity in Stockholm in June.So they have now changed their mind again? 🤔Sweden is very inconsistent."
2839	110994	why is this a controversial opinion?! flu shots are free, coronavirus vaccines should absolutely be free too
2840	110977	@SUNYUFS @uupinfo  Can we vote on a faculty vaccine mandate!  I think a majority of faculty would vote for a faculty vaccine mandate.  We want safe working conditions.  So if you're really representing faculty interests, why not put it to a vote?
2841	111327	We need an Apollo-type program with public-private partnerships to develop a universal coronavirus vaccine AND a universal flu vaccine. It would take 2 major pandemic threats off the table.
2842	107776	@BuckSexton Here is the one suggestion We can all agree on.The Covid-19 vaccine should be tested on our politicians, MSM, and professional athletes first!If they survive, it is safe.If they don’t, We are safe!!!
2843	109591	So what happens when vulnerable people have had their #COVID19 vaccine? Will they be expecting to mix with others as if the risk had disappeared for everyone? They still pose an infection risk and this needs to be made clearer, surely? @MattHancock @doctorshaib @drphilhammond
2844	109004	@chrisyeem Thanks very much CJ. I guess this winter will be harsh for Covid19 spread. So after Christmas when it's warmer and safer is probably best to take the vaccine.
2845	111398	The notion that Covid19 Vaccines were developed to fight humanity is utterly wrong and cannot be verified.Do you think we'll all be alive and well if the previous vaccines we received where developed to work against us?Please be wise! Go get a jab.
2846	108249	The Healthy Families Tax Credit will make Coronalife®️, a Bayer-Monsanto COVID-19 vaccine product developed by NIH scientists, accessible to all who want it while fueling innovation

2848	201943	1. I wasn’t allowed to say anything until today, but it's now done so.... I volunteered for the test phase of COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer. The vaccine is the one that has been developed in Russia. It is in 6 different stages and I received my first dose at 6:20 AM...
2849	111364	"But vaccines are not a cure.Flu shots don't always stop the flu year in and year out.So, even after there is a ""vaccine"" for the Wuhan and somebody gets it.....WHAT THEN?"
2850	111406	UK to start rolling out the vaccine next week - such a relief, thisLet’s hope other countries follow suit soon
2851	109864	These assholes couldn't help the American people for the last 8 months while  also denying how bad covid is yet they think they should be first in line for the vaccine?!
2852	112421	I know a 20yo who has/had it. Hospital said no relation to the vaccine... because it had been 3 months since he had the vaccine. 🤦🏻‍♀️
2853	111207	So, my mom is racist and xenophobic and her cousin doesn't believe coronavirus exist and that the vaccine is to install government chips. The rest of my family is homophobic and fighting over money...again. I hate it here.

2856	108811	#Coronavirus Tomorrow I will talk about these seven #vaccines that has been aprroved only for limited or emergency use in only one country until now. None of those vaccines has complete all phases. Chinese and russian's are used before being tested in phase 3 (called early use)

2861	107713	We can’t do this to our health care workers. They’ve already endured unimaginable tragedy. Get. The. Damn. #Vaccine!
2862	110714	Data after data shows the covid vaccine is very effective against severe hospitalizations and death.. If you can make sure to get vaccinated. With numbers like this i still dont know why folks are not prioritizing the vaccine over other unproven treatments #TwitteRx
2863	202284	@AljawazatKSA -taking into account that I received the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine when I was in Saudi Arabia.
2864	107943	Vaccines are nice, but it still doesn’t stop long-term effects and spread. We still need to care for ourselves, which in turn, takes care of one another. Do your part, please.
2865	111180	My grandmother was born in 1945. She told me that when the Polio vaccine came out in the 50s they lined her and other kids up at schools to get it. Unless you had a medical or religious exemption you had to get the shot.You lived through this too Joe.It’s not hard.
2866	112742	Let’s assume that what they would take is actually the vaccine. Pretty easy to have saline. Didn’t Barack stage swimming in the gulf while they were covering up the deep horizon oil spill...
2867	108503	@cmosl101 @larsp2740 @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I agree numbers are worse, clearly due to reopening efforts and human behavior (please, everyone wear a mask!). But we are still ‘flat’ compared to original estimates. Would you agree the Coronavirus will be around just like the flu? A vaccine will not stop or eradicate only slow
2868	110440	Dumb idea I might actually do: If you're taking a coronavirus vaccine, buy far OTM puts on the stock of the maker. That way you're partially hedged if there are some bad long-term effects to the vaccine (the lawsuits will probably kill the makers).
2869	111725	Oh my God! Babies Killed to Grow Vaccines ... This Is So Scary,... in less homosexualized times, they would already be hanging from streetlights.
2870	108742	@thehill Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
2871	112427	Not like I’d have the vaccine anyway but why are these getting them before the tax paying, good people who want the jab? If it’s to protect the staff then only the staff should get them not these sickos 🥴
2872	111611	Even if they by some miracle get a viable, safe vaccine quickly, getting enough doses to stop the virus around the planet will be maybe not impossible, but a huge challenge.
2873	201977	So I’ve got covid-19 pneumonia. Had to spend a few days in the hospital on supplemental oxygen. Go figure the very weekend I was gonna finally go get my vaccine I get sick. At home on bed rest slowly getting better. Still on supplemental oxygen. I’m just relieved to be home with-
2874	111380	Listen, don’t get me wrong I know people in this world are stupid. But my gosh how could a population of this century get fooled by Elon Musk and his colleagues. This virus is a scam to cut down on the worlds population. Anyone getting a vaccine, dumb! #COVID19 #CovidVaccine #uk
2875	201897	@kit_chrisr My BP was high couple of years ago.I got it down by loosing weight and reducing salt. Ironically I put weight back on during lockdown.I get very bad asthma if I get flu. I require dexamethasone and antibiotics .So now I always get flu vaccine.Dr told me to avoid Covid19
2876	109639	The four panelists on this 9th series are all medical lab scientists and the discussion will focus particularly on explaining the human immune system and immune response to the COVID-19 virus so that we can better understand the disease symptoms, the COVID test and the vaccine.
2877	112812	This is actually a really good idea. DisneyParks is one of the companies with the skills and experience necessary for something like this. They’re just handling long lines to be jabbed with a needle instead of get on space mountain
2878	111109	@AkulFred @CBCNS I live in the real world. I wish COVID19 wasn't here. Wasn't real. But it is.I know you don't want it hear it, but until there is a vaccine, pretending it's not something to take precautions against just endangers us all.I hope you consider wearing a mask to protect others.
2879	202448	I am a disabled man who would like to get the vaccine covid19 Palombara hospital Sabina province of Rome sent me home. i have my right to vaccinate to cover my health. i went site only over 80years and too slow  #CNN #wednesdaythought #FoxNews #MSNBC #bbcnews
2880	107702	@funder If we can't develop a vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, if people who have had Covid-19 don't really become immune to the new corona virus for long, what does that mean for the future of humanity? What is life going to be like?
2881	112397	We have No idea... But yea...Go ahead and get the vaccine...We'll find out later!There's Side Effects &amp; then there's Adverse Outcomes...
2882	108945	And this could all be a stunt to “miraculously survive” COVID-19 and his base will think he is a warrior. Once he gets better he will use it as a way to advertise the vaccine he is backing. How do we know this is real? All this con man does is lie!

2888	109137	Love this thinking ahead. Would have been all too easy to go all out on creating vaccine &amp; then have to think about how to get it out there. 👍
2889	107790	According to our 6th research work on  COVID-19 issue. the recent types of vaccines that are stated as if they are efficacy, not only are useless to contain the pandemic, but also we are in doubt about their efficacy!!

2893	109115	@NphcdaNG Hi, i have registered for covid19 vaccine. How and when do i get vaccinated, how do i know if it's in my area pls.
2894	112596	I'm not for or against the #CovidVaccine but I am surprised by the hype for it when it's only on stage 3 of testing and they can't even determine if its stops you carrying the virus. The vaccine is far from a saviour right now #coronavirus #COVID19
2895	202120	@JadeGurss Nothing else to tweet about.  Just waiting for my COVID-19 vaccine shots.  It should be soon.  I'm in the next list for people eligible to get the shots in Wisconsin.  So I've got to play the waiting game.  I'll tweet to you later.
2896	110775	Ang nakakatakot dito, we're trying to paint a picture that a vaccine will be readily available this year when it's in the early stages of human testing? With the entire world needing the vaccine, where and how will we be able to pay for the vaccine? Exclude private ulit?
2897	110495	No one has stated anything about a person already having the COVID-19 and survived with anti-bodies, no one addressed that they would be tested for COVID first before insisting on vaccine or those who have anti-bodies!
2898	201937	My experience not getting a COVID-19 vaccine, at age 36 around February of 2020 I got COVID-19 and most of the symptoms moderate to severe level. I never got tested for COVID-19, but I'm sure I already had COVID-19 and probably all of the variants.  #DeltaVariant

2901	109625	Make that nearly one billion guinea pigs LMAO...they wouldn't have released the vaccines or approved them if they didn't actually work. They had a year to isolate coronavirus strains and properly figure out how to counter the effects. So far side effects are minor and not...
2902	111401	@AnalyticsEqv A vaccine expert reiterated today that there will not be enough COVID-19 vaccines for everyone in the USA until May 2021.
2903	112394	Until a safe and effective vaccine is developed and globally disseminated, countries need to use some combination of social distancing measures to work to bring their Rt below 1 #COVID19 #Coronavirus
2904	110613	#WHO is playing with people’s lives. These vaccines were not tested in pregnant women. Nothing has changed to indicate that this is safe for them. This will most impact low income pregnant households who can’t afford to get sick and will take an untested vaccine #CovidVaccine
2905	109531	@PaulPleiger @2012gaily @NeilClark66 @TheMindsculpter If, each time time we made an immune response to the vaccines and to viruses, we reduced our fertility, no vertebrates (all of which have an adaptive immune system built on the same principle as our vaccine responses) would have survived. And COVID-19 would itself do the job.

2911	110270	@yaneerbaryam It’s Laine saying we need to eliminate the common cold. Without a pan coronavirus vaccine like DARPA is working on coming to fruition we’re stuck with it.
2912	109457	@hammy413 Trump could spin this to a positive.It's true there is no vaccine for AIDS. 37 years of research yielded no vaccine.So who is to say a vaccine for COVID19 will ever be created?Blue state governors banking on one to open their states is a bad strategy. What if one never comes?
2913	112567	Oops, Bertha, my mate 'stuck in the attic' @ThornfieldHall won't like this being in MSM. She LOVES vaccines and thinks that any doctor suggesting fruit and fermented foods improve the immune system should be STRUCK OFF 🤔😂😂😂Not one for the holistic approach, old Bertha..
2914	112259	@CNNBusiness Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
2915	110824	That's my hospital. Thanks, @MountSinaiNYC @MtSinaiQueens.However, I know that my OR team is already vaxxed because we did it together.
2916	109212	@ElCerritoPD @KRON4Desk Why is Covid-19 vaccine out and yet business still closed? why are things not back to normal why is it taking months on purpose who is be hide the bull shit who is getting rich?          Peace on earth
2917	110899	Good luck with that!  I am not going to take the vax.  There are oral meds that cure Covid.  Why would I subject myself to an experimental vaccine?
2918	109149	Just wondering, when or if Evangelicals will or ever notice PENCE just took the covid19 vaccine they claim covid19 will bring on the end of times and only they will go to Heaven. not to mention their JESUS Trump just said he would take the vaccine too. (((HELLO)) Evangelicals!!
2919	109933	These are very good news coming in So more vaccines are going to be got and every one will be vaccinatedSo as to chase away the virus#staysafe #BuildUG2gether #WhyUGDecidedM7
2920	112785	I find it appalling that while millions are desperate to get the  vaccine, the LAFD has to bribe firefighters to get it.
2921	112817	Surefire way to have half the population NOT take the vaccine.Cuz I wouldn't even eat a steak with trumps name on it.

2924	110426	With no Coronavirus vaccine in sight. It’s unlikely if BBN would hold this year and for the fact that Mercy just launched her real estate business, She will reign for a very long time and make it big before new stars pop out of the next BBN
2925	107989	How come they've never gotten a vaccine for ebola, malaria, HIV, cancer?, this covid19 thing is a plan to get some hidden agendas done.

2928	109127	@F1ght4Future @DrLiMengYAN1 The COVID-19 virus is a unique coronavirus pathogen, and the so-called new coronavirus vaccine is just a placebo.Any medicine has a toxicological effect, it is recommended not to vaccinate the new crown vaccine to prevent unknown side effects!
2929	109888	@DoniTheDon_ Delta is only mandating coronavirus tests for its “unvaccinated” workers. If you’re going to mandate testing, I truly do not understand why you wouldn’t test your entire workforce (the vaxxed and unvaxxed). The vaxxed can get infected and spread the virus too. Totally weird.
2930	111239	@JoeBiden You're a FUCKING IDIOT. The @potus does NOT approve a vaccine. A #coronavirus vaccine will be approved like ANY OTHER vaccine or drug. YOU ARE CAUSING PANIC AND DOUBT in a vaccine when it becomes available. YOU ARE A FUCKING WASTE!#HarrisBiden @TheFive #TheFive
2931	108047	@darakass The Covid-19 “Vaccines” (which they are only therapeutics, not actual vaccines) do not stop infection or spread. Neither quarantines nor masks stopped or greatly slowed the spread. If we want to get back to normal, just get back to normal, without trying to stop nature.

2943	108997	@fordnation Dumbass Doug...'there is no reason'? What an idiotic statement!!! One good reason is that there has never been a vaccine for a coronavirus...MORON!  How's the cure for the common cold going?  Ontario didn't bother to do research in that area?  Vaccine complication/death rate??!!

2957	108781	Dehumanization of the unvaccinated is 100% fascism and it's against human rights. People have the right to choose if they want to take a vaccine. #CovidVaccine #covid #coronavirus #antivaxxer #antivaxxers #unvaccinated #humanrights #fascism
2958	111523	@BBCPolitics Politician playing with people's lives!  Coronavirus is deadly! Like it or not we do not have a vaccine. Yes it is terrible we can't go out and businesses may close but we must try to contain the virus.
2959	108101	So your scare tactics won't work. CDC is a company not an Agency, and they produce Vaccines for Profit. Do you all get it now? CDC has a motive behind their actions, keep us locked down, so they can make their vaccines for profit.

2966	109462	Everyone who gets flu this winter is going to think they’ve got Covid and will have to self-isolate. Flu jabs are going to be critical for the working population. The strain on the NHS of a coronavirus and flu double whammy is hard to imagine. Get prepared, @MattHancock.
2967	110450	@healthyspecimen @Surfsand3 @suechitown @nathaliejacoby1 I think they messed up in trying to message the Vax. They should have said that each vaccine improves your immune system, and that since we are all inevitably going to get covid-19 as many times as probably the flu, it is reasonable, to a vax every now and then like the flu.
2968	111433	So Coronavirus is gone, huh? No vaccine. No treatment. No information. It's just going to be gone bc the orange dufu says it is. 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
2969	111275	This is the problem. The Govt want to stop misinformation on vaccines to ensure uptake. Yet this says to us that even if you've had the virus, despite t-cell immunity, you still have to isolate. If there's no endpoint, why have the vaccine?
2970	112862	I don’t trust Kenny what’s so ever...but this is ok with me. You want the vaccine go for it, but I won’t be getting it
2971	108855	Being a soldier for 6 years, made me hate vaccines.The Army forced me to get a penicillin shot, smallpox vaccine, 5 anthrax vaccines, and countless other vaccines.I'm not government property anymore.I'm not getting a coronavirus vaccine.
2972	111464	@Tigress58774042 So what are you trying to say here? all of it is deadly and should be feared Like Pneumonia you have vaccines and the Flu every year you have a different Vaccine for that due to mutation of the Virus. Who says there will not be testing for it? Vaccine is now being worked on.
2973	109803	@LJ_Pritchard @dgurdasani1 What do you mean”common coronavirus” she’s just outlined what it is. We already know you don’t become immune without a vaccine, how would it irreparably damaged their long term immunity? Are you suggesting letting children catch it? It’s not chicken pox. Leave it to the experts.

2975	112133	@MichaelGershon5 @Mssarahmssarah @NYCMayor @DOEChancellor @NYCHealthCommr Masks are not protection, people with Covid-19 think if they wear a mask they won't spread it. My 92 yo Dad died from Covid-19 before vaccine. In a locked down nursing home, all wearing masks. He got it from his masked caretaker. He wasn't the only one, it spread like wildfire.
2976	112373	So let me get this right, some peeps wont take Covid-19 vaccine because they dont know what’s in it or because of a so called chip in it, but would happily carry mobile phones around and eat whatever Mcdonald’s dishes out to them? Hilarious this aint! 😩🥺

2985	108252	It truly is a gift- I’m in the phase 3 Pfizer trial and still not sure if I had the real vaccine or not- I think I did due to the strong effects after mr second shot !
2986	108534	@out_th3re @ConservUSA38 @AP You obviously aren’t very intelligent, there is no stopping this. Have we stopped the flu after decades? Coronavirus is here to stay even with a vaccine. Shutting down the country will cripple the economy to no return. It would take decades to recover from another shutdown
2987	108086	This is a good analysis. Consumer confidence will likely be low as long as immediate testing and a verified vaccine are in place.
2988	109957	@AWokeZombie Not sure if this is a vaccine death or not. But it really has to be fully investigated. And if parents are reluctant to get their children vaxxed because of this uncertainty, I cannot disagree.

3032	110796	@HiiragiYuu_Vt It's not just about the COVID-19 Vaccine either but alot of these people tend to be full on Anti Vax/Medicine tooI myself was skeptical about getting my vaccine shortly after it was released, So I waited until there was some information, I got it within 2 months around May
3033	112529	(HOPEFULLY) EASY 2 READ (VERY BASIC) SUMMARY OF HOW THE COVID-19 VACCINE WORKS N WHY YOU CAN STILL CATCH THE VIRUS IF U ARE DOUBLE VAXEDdisclaimer: i am not a doctor/scientist, i just did high school bio n we had a unit on immunity, feel free to correct me if u are qualified to
3034	108932	People just have no sense of adversity when they are pro-herd immunity, @jkwan_md is bang on, without vaccine this plan is brutal

3036	109144	@FriendsofNancyP WHAT???  Russia  has become the first in the world to approve a vaccine for the coronavirus,  Putin announced on Tuesday, without clinical trials!!Looks like tRUMP  and MOSCOWMITCH sent their marxist buddy our vaccine technology!!!   TRUMP IS A TRAITOR!!!!!
3037	109368	@alphaorbust Pfizer has yet to come up with an effective vaccine for any Coronavirus. Last one killed more cats then it protected and is still on the market. Do your own diligence. Thats a joke!
3038	111800	@RachelRileyRR Whilst the vaccine can have short term side effects, if everyone is vaccinated then they are doing their bit. Those who think they know better should realise that #COVID19 will not go away. Just get vaccinated! I want to get back to watching @ManUtd instead of shouting at my TV!
3039	107806	"@latimes ""How do I get my coronavirus vaccine if I’m 65 and older? Here is what we know ""Hey, thanks LAT's for not answering the question we all want to know.HOW?"
3040	107923	@TheStarPhoenix How can we get heard immunity, when it is my understanding that  the vaccine doesn't make you immune from getting covid-19 or its variants.  Does it not make your symptoms less likely to cause hospitalization but you are still able to catch it and pass it on to others...
3041	112916	@CamJunior1972 @ChrisCuomo vaccines prevent you from infection because it trains your immune system to fight the specific virus. This vaccine doesn’t contain COVID19 you imbecile, you positioned yourself and your family, they will get sick because you took a mysterious ingredient injection
3042	111631	Everyone is already wearing masks and have been for I don’t know how long in blue hellhole states like mine and it’s clearly not fracking working you idiot. Trump already took care of the vaccine. Trump wanted schools reopened in September. So your plan is nothing. Got it.
3043	107948	@NaijaArsenal @10DowningStreet @BorisJohnson Coronavirus is incurable. Are you going to live like this forever? Or for the years a vaccine will take?
3044	112524	My parents had the Moderna vaccine on Saturday but she did not like that they could be up to 98 days before they get the other one.
3045	110901	@Faith_Sugar143 Stoke victims effected sides typically go downward like a sad face. Apparently, this is cerebral palsy, a reaction after taking the COVID-19 vaccine.
3046	112736	I actually talked about this with my friend yesterday.Its not the vaccine that scares me, its the corruption in the country. They will choose money over human life. Abeg exercise caution oh!
3047	111011	Are there any scientists out there who know if it's likely a vaccine can be developed for the virus? My mum told me it's not possible because it keeps changing,  is that true? #COVID19
3048	108135	What absolute BS by Hunt1. Couldn’t give a simple yes / no answer = spin as he is hiding something 2. If vaccine is safe why the indemnity? And just because other government do that as well is not good enough !!!3. We want to see the politicians and their families go first
3049	112018	Do they know the vaccine is free and effective against COVID-19 unlike every gun on their deck and roof.
3050	109302	“The weather’s getting cold, people are going to be inside more, the holidays are coming up and people are going to ignore the rules about not getting together. We’re very concerned.”Vaccine distribution is around the corner. Meanwhile, don’t be complacent. Please! #StayHome
3051	109789	Today I'm taking care of me. Gonna go for a run after my meetings. Then gonna go get my #COVID19 booster and my #FluShot. I am kinda ridiculously excited about that.
3052	109502	What? I've just seen someone smoking a fag after their #COVID19 #BoosterShot. How does that make any sense? Do people actually care about their health or are they brainwashed...
3053	112577	Just got my second dose of the Moderna #COVID19 vaccine.Will I be wearing my mask and continuing to social distance? Oh you bet. Why?Yes I'll be immunized, but not everyone is. Not everyone can be vaccinated and we're nowhere near herd immunity. We have to be safe.
3054	110880	Interesting!Why can’t we have antibody test before deciding if we want the vaccine? If we’re already immune, we might not need one!
3055	111618	@eadyIofficial i don't think so,as long as this global pandemic still going on and we haven't found the vaccine, it's not safe for the student to back to classes. like imagine if there's a student positive covid-19 in the classes, it would spread to the others student, teacher, and their family
3056	107706	"Don't undersell need for masks.Smartypants @DrPaulOffit  ""What keeps me up at night is that vaccines are going to be sold as magic..."" We're going to need to still wear masks after vaccine is widely available until we get COVID19 spread is truly under control. #AAP2020"

3058	110660	@AlbertoThomas @60rudeluddites @simondolan @davidicke @MattHancock No vaccine is 100% guaranteed to be effective, and with an extremely low Covid-19 death rate, why would someone take a chance on an adverse reaction without #BigPharma assuming liability.
3059	108107	Keith Gill: the Sun Belt will not mandate COVID-19 vaccinations, but I encourage everyone to get the vaccine.
3060	111244	They desperately want AZ vaccine. Pulled out all the stops, they tried to convince the U.K. to hand some over because it would be ineffective in too vulnerable groups. Now why? Maybe transmission blocking is very effective
3061	201844	I recently had the COVID-19 vaccine and my penis has shrunk in size (by around 3 inches). I’m very concerned, is this meant to happen?
3062	108219	@CDunnart @DraganOrlich @Hganoihs @RACGPPresident I study this a lot. Question is- why can’t we hear BOTu sides of the debate? Why is it just corporate support? And why is it we’ve never found a sustained vaccine for a coronavirus yet now these experimental ones are OK? Ask questions! This is about control- not our health.
3063	107724	@NickCavaciuti @liverpoolLfc07 @SkyNews My degree is in Biology....with a significant focus on Virology.  But there you go.COVID-19 has already mutated more than 300000 times.  That's expected....just like Flu etc.  The vaccines are still effective.
3064	110471	@W7VOA @RepCheri @RepWalberg We are all going to get it or the vaccine so let’s get on with life! #COVID19
3065	202280	They've been shockingly slow with the vaccine roll-out over here so I am Very Excited that I FINALLY got to make my appointments! 🥳 First one is next week.For those with health issues/sensitivities who've already had it, any problems I should prep for?#COVID19#CovidVaccine
3066	111417	@andersoncooper wants you to believe we have to have a vaccine and everyone tested and all the people in contact with the virus called on the phone to leave our houses. No Anderson. #coronavirus
3067	111321	Yo what if the vaccine to coronavirus is the mark of the beast ?! And you can’t go anywhere without the proof ? 🤔
3068	109180	I could be way out in left field, but my read here is LiveNation’s betting the 💰that all their artists will want vaccine proof &amp; tests so they’re not risking themselves and/or their crew getting sick and wiping out whole legs of their tours
3069	201835	Still no side effects from AZ vaccine 2nd jab.#COVID19  #COVID19LK My latest book is going to be pretty boring after a Pandemic

3071	202373	No side effects of any kind from my first COVID-19 vaccine (received on Monday);  when you get chance to get yours, I encourage you do so.   #gotmyCOVIDvaccine #CovidVaccine
3072	109661	@justinamash You must be new here. I’ve shown my yellow vaccine booklet from the 1960s to enroll in schools, college and grad school. It went overseas as part of my visa to live in and/or visit numerous countries. My COVID-19 vaccine card is now with my passport and Global Entry card.
3073	110981	I'm guessing this will be for healthcare workers. I've long said that we'll get the first vaccine and that it may also be kinda shitty.To some degree, I'll just take it if it won't harm me. And I'll keep using PPE (I have reusable) and we'll maintain our testing regimens.
3074	109141	@StephanieGridl5 @NBAonTNT The vaccine doesn’t protect you from catching COVID-19 so how can it prevent them from contracting it if you can still get it &amp; spread it to them? For a teacher you aren’t very smart. You are why we need standardized testing to weed out teachers who lack the ability.
3075	112385	Vaccine, Vaccine, Vaccine, VaccineCoronavirus please don't take my manVaccine, Vaccine, Vaccine, VaccinePlease don't take him just because you can

3077	110318	@FugitiveMn @Djpmidlo @sophiaw15813990 @GovTimWalz There *was* no vaccine for a coronavirus. Just like there *was* no cordless telephone but now there is. Technology changes. Time marches on.
3078	110859	Serious question I had booster in left arm yesterday and two jabs in my right arm months ago Why is my right arm aching today and not my left ? Weird #COVID19 #BoosterShots
3079	109593	@_DigitalIndia @IndiaPostOffice #cancelcompartmentReasons:-1. Students got compartment only in one subject.2. Students failed by very few marks.3. Coronavirus cases still increasing with precautions,no vaccine yet.4. We are stressed and depressed. 5. Students who did not appear for exams get promoted.
3080	108709	The vast majority of people already have a 99% non hospitalisation rate if they contract #COVID19How did it get to the point that people think getting a vaccine against hospitalisation improves their odds when the odds are already in their favour?The world has gone insane.
3081	108546	If that’s the case then doesn’t that mean a vaccine is out of the picture? Because a vaccine is essentially a small does of the virus enough to help you create antibodies so that you don’t get sick lol.
3082	110512	The UK Government states the #coronavirus vaccine is safe and effective. Why would we believe this? They have been telling us lies for years! Unfortunately, the nature of the beast!
3083	110574	Well, our country's president said that we'll never return to normal until a vaccine is formulated..I had several questions in my head like, when's that going to happen, who are the receipients, what will happen to those who wont be given the vaccine? 😐
3084	111455	@chiefagbabiaka I'm happy ooooGod please answer my prayers. We know that Buhari Don die since but they fit use this Covid19 vaccine to claim that he died because of it
3085	110084	This vaccine is extremely effective and extremely cheap, pure insanity it's not going out to the world right now
3086	112445	@Nucleics_Inc @LeslieTeng1 @MartyMakary @MartinKulldorff Just as there is no long term studies on the vaccine. I'd rather take my chances with my immune system. it's a coronavirus, just like common colds,.we have immunity for life.
3087	107723	How long do the vaccines last ? a year , two years/ ten years? I am going to get my Tetanus, Diptheria and Pertussis vaccine after Coronavirus , due to interactions perhaps? anyway WIll I get covid again from injections after I recover from the current epidemic?
3088	109470	@willsutton @NOLAnews @LADeptHealth Will, I guessing you got the vaccine. You should be safe from getting the virus correct? I believe you are not safe because the vaccine doesn’t prevent you from get COVID-19 or passing COVID-19 so if it doesn’t do either of those things why fucking why get the vaccine? TTU
3089	112165	This is appalling reporting. Enough. #AstraZeneca is a safe and effective vaccine against coronavirus
3090	109242	Good news keep coming about the vaccines#CovidVaccine #Pfizer #Moderna #COVID9 #coronavirus #pandemic
3091	110452	How can we establish a baseline with covid 19 when we know that the testing does not satisfy Koch postulates?!They never isolated the virius!Trickey at its finest, just like how pharam say they use a placebo  their safety trails for vaccines.But their placebo is not benign!
3092	107701	First I wanted to donate my vaccine to Bill Clinton. I take that back. I would like to exchange my vaccine for Big Willy’s dose. I’ll take his and he can have mine.
3093	108869	@jazzdude4 Among old/immunocompromised, COVID-19 has death rates up to 7%, or 20 times influenza. And there's no vaccine. So as much as I'd love to follow your condescending advice and calm down, it's my job to take this seriously and recognize it for what it could be.
3094	108463	A #coronavirus #vaccine is not a return to normality.  It's a hedge against stupidity. The stupidity of others.
3095	107856	"My first COVID19 dream:Everyone started turning into zombies. Vaccine gets made.Some people eagerly take it.We people decide ""it's Zombie world now"" and deliberately get bitten.Vaxxed people try to jab their loved ones on the sly.It's debated hotly."
3096	107720	@GOP @realDonaldTrump I cannot imagine putting my well-being or my family's in the hands of the most corrupt, criminal Admin in USA history.So, although we'll get our usual flu vaccine, we will not take a Covid19 vaccine offered before next spring.#GOPComplicitTraitors
3097	112134	Getting there little by little. Either the unvaxxed will die or they will get CoVid-19 and then get themselves and all family members vaxxed. One way or another, I’m gonna find ya…#CovidVaccine Peace NOW.
3098	109497	@dougducey @AZDHS For the flu? One that I don't get the shot for in 20yrs and will not take the covid-19 vaccine either. Im healthy so no need.
3099	111711	"Lol Politicians getting ""the vaccine"" in public. Don't even know where to start with this. I mean, I know they're stupid/careless/trusting enough to do it, but why would any conspiracy theorist believe it weren't saline? 90% of what the elite does at this point is lazy handwaving"
3100	202002	I had my first jab last week (Ox-AZ)! In &amp; out under 15 min, then a 15 min wait post-jab before driving - couldn't have been easier or better organized.  Didn't even feel the actual jab, no side-effects aside from a slightly achy arm &amp; mild headache. Very happy! @NHS @UniofOxford
3101	109586	I just got my first COVID19 vaccine! 1 year into a devastating pandemic and the human world is (largely) coming together to fight this common foe. Please sign up for your vaccine shot, wash hands, distance, and mask, all signs of respect for each other. ❤️
3102	112725	just read this whole thread - spooky in its implications - amazing work!  Only ? I may have is there any difference in vaccines used and do they follow the 2 shot protocol va Ontario and I am now pondering what the hell is going to happen when Ontario starts 2nd shot in 4 no
3103	108958	@ShaunaLeas @Gmant055 @washingtonpost A mass vaccination strategy against an airborne coronavirus in the midst of a pandemic with a leaky untested vaccine is a very bad vaccine use case. It is very stupid, and as Geert VDB predicted has been a disasterScience is not your strong suit, I can tell
3104	109190	The vaccine should be tested on politicians first. If they survive, the vaccine is safe. If they don't, then the country is safe!!!#TrumpVirusDeathToll193K #coronavirus #indiawithkanganaranaut #ModiFailsIndia #ChinaIndiaFaceoff #COVIDー19 #DelhiRiots2020 #ImmortalSushant

3106	109507	The work @NHSuk has done with the @pfizer @BioNTech_Group vaccine has been truly incredible. Shout out to the amazing @Emily_JR_Lawson 👇🏾👇🏾👇🏾
3107	111115	@UmarNaseerMV There are many reasons why herd immunity may not work for Covid-19. There is no vaccine, which is the most safe way for a population to practice herd immunity, scientists don't know if one can contract the virus &amp; develop Covid-19 more than once, n/1
3108	112554	going out on a bleak limb and officially predicting a certain someone is going to take credit for this vaccine (which will not work) in order to get votes from dipshits and then the dictatorship REALLY kicks off
3109	112901	What if this is all because DT doesn’t want to take the vaccine that he’s going to push on to Everyone else?! #DonaldTrump #COVID19
3110	201840	COVID-19 just took away my last bit of happiness by closing my gym. That’s the last straw. Get a damn vaccine out
3111	109135	Mxm, the vaxxers are quiet 😒. Not only do they spread bs💩, but they be spreading the “super variant” 😒. SN: hope this makes y’all realise how annoying y’all sound when y’all got something “smart” to say about people who exercise their RIGHT to NOT take the CV “vaccine”
3112	107772	"@WIREDScience And after one year with covid-19 there is still no as an exact answer for the question ""does it work?"". I wonder if it is 'the rush for pruducing a working vaccine' takes the biggest portion of the medicine industry's time and resource?"
3113	112300	@jacobkornbluh Don't have one, don't want one and everyone mind your own business,You believe a lie ,I am 60 year's old,I had covid19 last year it was a bad flu but I got over it ,I recovered ,weak people should get the vaccine if the live in fear , because fear will kill ya.
3114	109002	What's the point?Testing results enable contact tracing and inform those who definitely need to isolate.  Without rapid testing, cases will increase until there is herd immunity (70% or more of population infected) or until there is an effective vaccine.
3115	108362	Everyone during the shutdown: “I can’t wait until this virus goes away and everything can get back to normal” *COVID19 vaccine comes out*People from my hometown: “I ain’t getting no damn vaccine. They’re implanting tracking devices in you”
3116	110923	They also have ZERO liability on any vaccine they produce. Major conflict of interest as they have no financial risk of making a dangerous product. Yet the sheep will flock to it. Ill take my chances with eating right, working out, and building up my immune system.
3117	202127	@Alixxa shore does 😕 2021There's a major covid-19 out-break in my area😷all because an anti-vaccine pastor, who caught covid-19,well on vacation in Quebec; then passed it on to his congregation😈i've been to all the hot spots and i still feel fine🤨so does that mean pfizer works💉
3118	110652	@gemmaod1 As the COVID-19 virus is just a cold virus, and COVID-19 is just the common cold (and has directly killed absolutely no one), only an idiot would take a vaccine for a cold virus!  Ahchoo (excuse me)!

3125	110521	Friendly reminder: A vaccine isn’t going to magically end corona. Please remember that when it comes out, we will still need to practice social distancing + washing our hands routinely + wearing masks before we can see any return to “normalcy”.
3126	112356	Get jabbed, or get Coronavirus now if you're young, enjoy the summer, save the winter. We don't want a reopening wave then.
3127	110873	In the meantime we can all continue to play our part. We are urging all residents to get their COVID-19 jab - it's not too late to get the first or second jab if you haven't already - and encourage everyone to get their booster when eligible to do so.

3135	108873	This is why no one trusts this govt. Who are these sources? Who is on the panel? What is happening considering till a few days ago, consensus was that one should get jab after rapid antigen test which showed level of antibodies. Just say you dont have vaccines, dont make up stuff
3136	111146	I’m not surprised....if only the rest of Kansas could get with the program. Spreading awareness and education on the vaccine helps.

3138	112488	@AldoAvina Been people in America getting reinfected. The flu is a version of coronavirus so why do we believe a vaccine will be 100% effective. Is it more realistic that developing better treatments is the way to go?

3150	108910	Seen three posts on my TL of people getting COVID-19 vaccines. This is promising, hoping my parents get theirs soon 🙏🏾
3151	202441	My family lost a very dear friend to COVID-19 over the weekend. Lena Warren is part of my earliest childhood memories and was more like my aunt. Our hearts are broken! And I type this tweet on the eve of my second dose of the vaccine. We have GOT to stop the spread of this thing.
3152	112148	@aurorabennu @CSaulnierHfx Then you clearly dont understand what science is. Science is the study of information. Humans can be biased but science isn't. As for the scientists that developed the vaccines. Their work wasn't sloppy and this isn't the first coronavirus vaccine to exist
3153	108203	After the election.They've also been conditioned to think that a vaccine will be their savior, despite the fact that no coronavirus has had a vaccine.
3154	108988	@CloydRivers Folks liking this acting like they weren’t saying the COVID-19 vaccine wasn’t FDA approved and therefore they couldn’t trust it. So do you want the government’s oversight or not??? Lmao
3155	111656	My job is having certain people try to get an anaphylaxis shot approved for those who are elderly that will be administered the covid vaccine. It has been shown the shot causes anaphylaxis shot in elderly patients.
3156	201888	As of this morning, me and my parent got our first COVID-19 vaccine!! We did it. I’m so proud of this accomplishment! https://t.co/Nc7ELgVr6v
3157	107859	@NotDevinsMom No I am 55 and in Wisconsin the registry has data back to 1960's.    It all depends on their ability to gather data and what the state requires of providers.    My COVID19 vaccines appeared immediately after I got the shot.    Then again WI is not Alabama.
3158	108011	@piersmorgan True but the research on a SARS vaccine probably dried up when  SARS disappeared.  It doesnt mean a vaccine isnt possible . SARS was technically a Coronavirus
3159	108667	Even #Jharkhand announced free vaccine.. But Shameless #Maharashtra govt is no intention to give it for free.. @OfficeofUT When are you going to announce it???? @priyankac19
3160	109106	"@newscomauHQ @BaronBlacky @ScottMorrisonMP is quite mad!  Based on his past behaviour, we can expect it to go from ""free vaccine"" to ""everyone MUST get free vaccine""!  Why?  He's not stupid enough to think a vaccine will eradicate COVID19....surely!  Perhaps he’s hoping to ""flatten the curve"" again."
3161	108469	@Goat_Jump_Ranch @_lorieeee @disclosetv Natural immunity from the original strain of COVID-19 is WAY better than the vaccine. If you’ve already caught covid once then you don’t need to get vaccinated. EVIDENCE has shown you’re more likely to catch it a second time if you get the vaccine. Don’t go by what the say!
3162	112104	It's looking less and less likely that there will ever be a vaccine for covid-19 so is @T_Deeney never going to play football again?
3163	111298	Wonder what the real answer they want to track and trace Black, Indigenous and elderly.  Couldn't pay me to take that vaccine if Gates has any part of it!
3164	112469	They stopped offering Covid19 vaccines anywhere in my area because most everyone is so old that they were eligible months ago. Now I am eligible and can't get one. I knew I was going to fall into a crack. I'm going to have to wait for herd immunity.☹️
3165	109046	"No.  I have NEVER HAD a flu vaccine, never had the flu.  Don't get ""tested,"" don't get the diseases they test for."
3166	109551	Coronavirus vaccine will take 'many months' and 'there are no guarantees' one can be found, Business Secretary Alok Sharma admits as Number 10 announces first trials will begin next weekscientists are confident they can get jab for the incurable disease rolled out for millions
3167	112251	I think about this every time someone brings up the vaccine. I’ve seen I Am Legend one too many times lol
3168	201961	@SunilKumarAus My friends 23 year old daughter got the #Moderna shots last spring. She just got her booster shot last Monday, then she tested positive on Tuesday for #covid19.
3169	112408	@realDonaldTrump The medical experts will find a vaccine for Coronavirus but we need a vaccine that will stop you being a racist, mad, ignorant and psychopath! Only way to fix half the problems in America is by people voting you out.
3170	108499	@AnnastaciaMP Remember coronavirus isn't Covid-19, the testing can't distinguish between influenza A or B, let alone Covid-19. But they hope you don't realise this because it blows the lid off their illusion to push the vaccine!
3171	111558	To leave unjabbed frontline workers in position over the winter period when the system is most stretched and then to sack them in the spring proves that these are really punishment sackings for not obeying Government orders. If they were a real danger, they would be removed now.
3172	109095	"It's as if the vaccines work and ""healthy immune systems"" don't know what they are doing with something they've never dealt with before... Weird!"
3173	111061	Take NO risk! Get the Vaccine!A Missouri couple say they dragged their feet on getting the Covid-19 vaccine. Then they got sickhttps://t.co/DIzSHwPUiX
3174	109512	Looks like my January trip to Italy is a no-go 😡Tightened #COVID19 restrictions, a new #SuperGreenPass requirement, the new #STATODIEMERGENZA, and the no acceptance of my @sputnikvaccine are huge red flags.This is awful.
3175	202409	Got my COVID booster shot! Fingers crossed my arm being sore is all I deal with #johnsonandjohnson #COVID19 #COVIDVaccine
3176	111434	@dg101799 @johnnymcqueen4 @free_man789 There isn't a vaccine. But you know what Covid19 is don't you?.Far worse than they're telling you. See.survivors now getting really sick? Those with mild symptoms progress to getting all sorts. Only those under 18 that are unscathed. The Chinese only want the gullible to survive.
3177	111507	Trenton NJ is really on that “Who do you know” and “Which Church do you attend” to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. Which is why I must depend on County level to get my shot. Some of these folks would rather I die so they could walk their crusty ass into my Wake, than answer my email.
3178	112451	“Some models suggest.”🤨During the Jan 2021 surge (basically no vaccines) the US only hit 4000 deaths/day on 5 total days. And now, with HALF the population fully vaxxed, the models are showing it’s going to happen again?? Either the vaccines don’t work or these are bad models.
3179	109727	@JustinTrudeau So Twinklebud… how many times is this you’ve had #COVID19 … yet you’re still pushing these useless #Pfizer #vaccines Time to give it up… we knew you were stupid but really! You’ve taken stupid to another level! How bout calling an Election! Go Get #Boosted! 🤦‍♀️😢
3180	110819	NO VACCINE FOR ME! Bill Gates and Fauci can stick mine in their own 🍑. #wewillnotbevaccinated #HCQzinc4prevention #BillGatesBioTerrorist
3181	108264	This doesn’t actually surprise anyone, right? We all remember the millions of doses of Pfizer with nowhere to go.They were so busy taking their victory lap on getting the vaccine manufactured and approved that they didn’t bother actually planning to distribute it.
3182	108010	Already booked in for my first COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday. That’s how confident I am that it’s safe. #Iwillgetvaccinated
3183	109498	Actually the scientists all said they don’t know if the vaccines will work on the current strain. Studies are being carried out. What they said is if a vaccine was available they would take it irrespective. But since we have access to only a handful of doses it’s largely academic
3184	111092	So basically the vaccine requires boosters after 8 months 🧐 does the vaccine work or not which is it ????
3185	112415	Got my first covid19 vaccination with the biontech vaccine today, feeling pretty good right now, but my arm hurts a bit 😅
3186	202319	Orange juice, gatorade, soup, vitamin C gummies, water, blankets and Kleenex, all the essentials for Pfizer shot #2! #GetVaccinated ...even if it hurts a little. 👩🏽‍⚕️💉🧬 #CovidVaccine  #COVID19 #Medicine #Vaccine
3187	108824	@Cheezman20 @Noahpinion So tyranny and death? Anyway no way to keep the number that low now. We are easily 18 months out from a working vaccine being mass distributed. That means we will be in the second covid-19 season. So buckle up.
3188	112545	"President Biden says it's Americans' ""patriotic duty"" to get the COVID-19 vaccine when they can. ""We're going to beat this pandemic, and because of the great docs up this staircase, we're going to beat cancer once and for all."""

It was the Message in whole the Twatter Ass Maggots don't want exposed.[BILL GATES] FUNDED THE WHOHAN LAB,SPONCERED EVENT 201,HAS A PATENT ON VACCINE FOR COVID19,HAS PATENT ON MICROCHIP IN VACCINE.Does anyone smell fish yet?
3190	110025	@mattgaetz The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is by far the safest one for cancer patients like myself, and in general the best protection from the ROOT cause, SARS-2. An adenovirus-moth grown, safe alternative to those currently on the market, why isn't it approved yet?
3191	109261	@Str8Knightmare @CMiner65 @Bathtileplaster @EdricBrown @HackBlackburn @KathyBurke This COVID-19 vaccine doesn’t actually have the virus in it either.
3192	109778	@Telstar22995931 @emmavconroy @SepsisUK All viruses travel they have done since time began this is the 7 th coronavirus we don’t have a vaccine for the other 6 but now have one for this
3193	109678	@bennyf99 I stand corrected, apologies. I would still question a genetically engineered vaccine and I'd still be skeptical of its effectiveness as opposed to a healthy immune system. I don't want to take a covid-19 vaccine, my body, my choice.
3194	108187	Yo, like, if you’re an antivaxxer, I just HAVE to assume you’re literally too stupid to know how they work 🤷‍♀️ #COVID19 #CovidVaccines #sorrynotsorry
3195	112864	Coronavirus is a respiratory virus that doesnt have a vaccine. instead of not getting it (ala when u get a flu shot) some ppl will get it &amp; difficulty getting over it. Healthier ppl will get it, get over it, &amp; move on. It’s the inundation of treating the sick that’ll be annoying
3196	112381	It only applies to Canadian citizens, it's weeks away, and you may still have to quarantine at home. So the government's line is: Vaccines work, but only if you got 'em in Canada. Non-citizens, meanwhile, are an existential threat.It's just bonkers. It makes zero sense.
3197	111029	Why? It doesn't make sense when they have said the vaccine doesn't prevent getting infected or it  spreading, only the seriousness once infected. So therefore it wouldn't make any difference 🤷🏼‍♀️
3198	109998	Why is anyone getting a vaccine? I’m vaccinated because they said do your part, u can’t travel protect yourself  etc. I got sick after second shot. I will not be risking my health for a booster that does nothing to protect me or anyone else. Vaccines only benefit those selling it
3199	108156	I think that this is a great way for vaccine public awareness. And it’s not like majority of us are going to go to Krispy Kreme everyday anyways. 🤷🏽‍♀️#krispykreme
3200	202442	@Laurie_Garrett Doctor Garrett did the Pope receive the #COVID19 vaccine and said it wasn’t against church? If I were the Pope I’d say to my flock I practice what I preach. Encourage people of all religions to get vaccinated. This is a all hands on deck kinda thing.
3201	109751	The U.S. needs to ship out the remaining vaccines now. If the idiots anti-vaxxers don't want it, stop wasting it and get it to people who do.
3202	112446	The question is why did US start to develop vaccine if they haven't had any case in US or if China hasn't shared the gene sequences with world yet . Can't you get your lies straight? #COVID19
3203	109830	@J_Effing_B @Dmack2407 @EthanStarr45 Because living a healthy lifestyle &amp; building your body's immune system will do more to protect you from a virus than an untested vaccine when I had covid19 back in July I quarantined but I also jogged &amp; walked around my yard to strengthen my lungs. Being healthy saved my life
3204	111683	@realDonaldTrump This idiot still doesn’t get it! CoronaVirus is at a 4% death rate and spreading with NO VACCINE YOU IDIOT!! It will continue to spread and take lives with no vaccine. Then when they do get one, it still has to be administered, &amp; we know how well that’ll go with you at the helm!
3205	109590	The French govt sends their jackbooted stormtroopers to disperse the masses protesting a stupid fucking idea. Like that's gonna encourage them to get the jab. Get pissed. Cos it won't be long before it happens in your area...
3206	110519	@ewarren I heard got #COVID19 even with so-called #vaccine.  Huh, another one shows #vaccines don't work.
3207	108096	Hey @krispykremeUK can we get this over here? Or is it a US only thing? I've had my first covid vaccine and I love Krispy Kreme 😀💞
3208	112641	You are Part of the Great Vaccine ExperimentNot every American will want to take the new Coronavirus vaccine once it has been approved.  But there are many who have already stepped up to take the vaccines that will help to determine if and when the rest of us should.
3209	112305	If the new COVID vaccine is free, and it’s not patented, then it will alleviate a lot of the civil unrest happening now. People will stop dying and getting ill from Covid. No BBQAnon rallies. Families can hopefully safely go back to work. And the learning gap will slow down.
3210	108551	@MontagueTerrie @RayUngerer Do you, or your ageing parents take the flu jab annually??It’s a virus, it mutates…. Annually.Covid-19 is a virus, it too will mutate…. Annually.
3211	108641	As I recall, and I may be wrong, when the Polio vaccines came out there was NO charge for them.  My concern is the price Big Pharma could charge for the vaccine as they already do for most drugs. Jus' sayin.
3212	112129	"@JimMFelton I CANNOT WAIT for the advertising campaign where this lot roll up their sleeves up, look directly into the camera and say their catchphrases, but all Corona-y. ""I'm getting the vaccine because my doctor's got an -ology""""Coronavirus! You are the weakest link, goodbye"""
3213	202226	What a fantastic experience today getting my first #COVID19 vaccine injection at The Royal Hampshire County Hospital 🏥 Clear signage, great instructions both verbal and written just a great system from start to finish 👏🏻 👏🏻 #Pfizervaccine #COVID19Vaccine https://t.co/wTs4JbvifH
3214	111547	@wagsSC The vaccine doesn't stop the virus. It reduces the symptoms. The virus is called SARS-Cov-2The vaccine deals with COVID-19 which is the symptoms not the virus
3215	107960	@RichardGrenell @TwitterSupport Rachel, why are you spreading misinformation about COVID19?  The vaccine does not stop it.  You can still get Covid and infect others even if you’re vaccinated.  Now stop or we will have to report you to Twitter. Just kidding. We know they don’t care what YOU say.
3216	111614	@tr6pilot @BuckSexton He was. The novel coronavirus is not an influenza virus.Flu vaccines are not mandated.
3217	109513	@miffed_slightly @DebbieL59701084 @delbigtree Like I said, go ahead and be the first to take the coronavirus vaccine, oh you might of taken one with the flu shot. This one will be special though, I don’t want to bore you with the details. I’ll let you look into how bill gates and, WHO, NIH, NIAID are connected to eugenics.
3218	110511	. #Moderna says #COVID19  vaccine 94.5% effective.Good news.But vaccines cant put an end to a pandemic just like that.So keep those masks on please
3219	110316	@BorisJohnson No need for lockdowns, masks or vaccines if you actually ran the country like a properly run businessIt's not our job to protect the NHS, it is yours to make sure it is fit for purposeThe buck stops with you BOJO #TheUKisAMess
3220	112346	There will never be a coronavirus vaccine.The Coronavirus family are RNA viruses and mutate like wild.By the time you brew a vaccine, it will be a completely different strain.Thanks China!
3221	111203	@cziriak_ I'm actually feeling like death warmed over upon waking up this morning. Received my second and final moderna covid-19 vaccine yesterday and although yesterday I felt super great... Today I feel just the total opposite... 😐
3222	112686	How stupid do the red hat anti maskers have to b to1. Think the vaccine contains live coronavirus 2. The vaccine keeps them fr being exposed to the virusThe vaccine ISNT A FORCEFIELD. You will be exposed to the virus, and your body will easily fend it off bc of the vaccine!
3223	108699	Good now people will hopefully shut up about “it’s not an approved vaccine, it’s only emergency use, I won’t be a SHEEP”They probably won’t….but god I hope.I’m sure most of my followers are vaccinated but if you’re not please please please get the shot 💉
3224	112568	I know this is a high plateau but it’s working! The US will get this under control. Because, well, loads of money and vaccines. Which we may not have - however, we do have the reassurance that the vaccines seem to be helping with reducing spread. That’s enough for me to hope
3225	109297	This is the NHS Chief Midwife, urging pregnant women to get the jab, even though we DO NOT have the data to say this jab is safe!! @TeamCMidO - we would formally like to invite you for an interview to defend your stance. Could you kindly get in touch please? 👍 PLEASE SHARE! 👊🔥
3226	109074	@tweettruth2me Antibody Dependent Enhancement. It’s been the fate of all prior Human Coronavirus vaccines (trialed in mice/ferrets, not humanity). Wrecked cellular Immunity, coupled with the shots still being coded to the Wuhan strain. I am worried for my vaccinated friends and loved ones 😞
3227	110954	@Nick_Pye If it ever ends 😡 and aren’t they protected by the Coronavirus Law 🤔. Just like they will be with the vaccine 😡
3228	111185	Remember when Right Wing religious extremists would go around murdering abortion doctors for Jesus? Well, those same people believe that the coronavirus vaccine will kill everyone who gets it...
3229	108993	@YahooFinance @denitsa_tsekova Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
3230	112510	Repubs when a private school teaches kids that racism is bad: 🤬🤬🤬Repubs when a private school purges all staff who get the vaccine: 🦗🦗🦗
3231	111336	@bluebug1954 @GovSisolak No thanks to everything you said. You’re welcome to get an experimental vaccine, I’m happy it exists for the elderly, but the young and healthy don’t need it. Especially not those of us who already had Coronavirus.
3232	201826	Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday took the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine at Delhi Heart and Lung Institute here.His wife also took the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine here. https://t.co/cVcp49xjHs
3233	109977	@axios Not surprising. GOP are virus sceptical so don’t take precautions, which leads to getting infected. How many more times will we see this? How many times will they open up too soon and let COVID-19 run wild? Add in vaccine hesitancy and it could take a long time to get rid of.
3234	109240	@IsaacMadengu @thehill He's very much connected with Anthony Fauci, who is making the vaccine push here. And many outlets do recognize Gates as a leading figure in the international Coronavirus response.
3235	108689	@DrEricDing I am sorry, but He is not a Doctor. So He should not have a say on what is needed! Only the Doctors that have made this vaccine know how many shots will bring a person 95% coverage from #COVID19!
3236	108114	Happy News: just made an appointment for my 90-year old mom to receive the coronavirus vaccine! So excited!!! 🤗
3237	108983	@Jgfleet661 @DemocracysBrnr @NBCNews The next coronavirus will be novel, but they will have a head start on a vaccine because of what they learned this time. Talk today was of a pan corona vaccine that addresses some more basic trait the family has in common. It may need to be tweaked each season like influenza vax.
3238	108853	People really think they’re gonna get a vaccine for COVID19 and it’ll all be over with 🥱 this is our new normal,  you can’t completely eradicate a virus
3239	111034	Please get vaccinated if you are eligible. Our great teamwork is our only way out #CovidVaccine #COVID19Aus
3240	111795	"@BigDaddyLiberty That profile is the kinda idiot who STILL doesnt know masks do nothing to protect against Coronavirus.And that profile believes so intensely in its satanism,it is threatening employers they'll""meet their makers""if they oppose the misnomer #MarchToSaveLives for vaccines that kill"
3241	109187	I mean we all want to return back to normal. But you can’t say that vaccine is proven safe. I won’t be apart of taking that. Plus I’ve had COVID-19 before and am younger, so I feel my body will fight it easier and have built up immunity for it. We need to look after the elderly.
3242	112664	When they develop a coronavirus vaccine -will the anti vaxxers use it? Or do they just oppose some vaccines
3243	109006	I know Coronavirus panic is being used to try and put the boot on our necks, but what if it makes people realize they need to be a little more self-reliant in an uncertain world?  I'm hopeful that 55% of New Yorkers wouldn't take an experimental vaccine,
3244	112528	I don't even want it around like the flu. Wish people of today were smarter about vaccinating. 😔😔😔 Vaccines are the reasons we don't worry about polio, tuberculosis, the flu, measles, and so on. Maybe we won't even worry about cancer &amp; HIV w their own emerging vaccines soon.
3245	201810	I just got the COVID-19 booster shot. Let’s see if I’ll feel like I just woke up from a seizure again like the second shot. Seriously, that shit hurt.
3246	111205	"To COVID-19 antivaxxers: The government already put  microchips in everyone (&amp; has continued to do so on newborns) when the ""Freedom Act"" was put into law after 9/11. They don't need to waste money on implanting ANOTHER microchip in you with the COVID-19 vaccine..DUHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
3247	108747	So great to hear the Moderna vaccine is 94.5% effective against coronavirus. Any good news is so welcomed. But our reliance on getting this information through a press release without seeing data needs to change.
3248	107952	Title: Asymmetric information and its influence on the distribution of the Covid-19 Vaccine. Meaning: no one is gonna go get it.
3249	202021	My spring break summary:- 923 tweets sent- 8 virtues signaled- 2 masks worn (one over the other)And I got my COVID-19 vaccine. I forgot to announce on Twitter that I received my vaccine, but thought I would let every one know that I got one, because I’m a teacher.
3250	108017	So they know not only that there will be another #pandemic, but also that it will be a #coronavirus again. Interesting.Thinking faceYou can bet that if they actually do come up with such magical #vaccine that it will be basically mandatory - even moreso than the jab for covid.
3251	107883	If it is true my beloved government will steal the vaccine and sell it to our neighbors then vaccinate us water ( fake)
3252	109221	Great for us. But American exceptionalism is dying.   The problem with this is that poverty stricken countries cannot afford any vaccine and there wont be any left for them. Covid-19 is world wide. Its even in Antarctica. The WORLD needs vaccine. @JoeBiden
3253	112455	@TheSiuloir @Dr2NisreenAlwan @jeremycorbyn So would you approve ‘unvaccinated HCW(because they don’t believe in the vaccines) vaccinating patients with covid19 vaxes?.
3254	110184	@elonmusk Why not Tesla get into producing vaccines for masses in poor countries against Viruses such as coronavirus
3255	108084	@itvnews If the ‘vaccine’ doesn’t stop transmission, you’ve had #covid19 and recovered, why the hell would you waste a vaccine rather than protect someone else?!? This is the most absurd statement so far. Absolute rubbish.
3256	110098	If there is no cure or vaccine for the old common cold coronavirus why would there be one for this newest coronavirus?
3257	108465	This election is lost. Declare it a fraud, move to state legislators appointing the electors.  Take next 2 years to work on a true fair system, cost not object. implement it and test it, like moon shot, or covid19 vaccine priority. All chips on the table. This is it.

3260	111295	@ZLoescher @rauzersg1 @9NEWS What a bizarre response. It’s not as if doctor Fauci is the only expert supportive of vaccines. The vast majority of them are. Covid is a novel virus. That means it’s new. And we’ve never had a vaccine for a Coronavirus before.  The rest is just an odd series of deflections.
3261	112760	Thank you @ReneeMerrifiel3 for bringing attention to this. It is too late for my grandmother, but many elderly will not receive vaccines for months. They deserve all the resources we can provide.
3262	110583	The liberals are having a talk about the importance of working together during covid while they are in charge of the only country in the world where they didn’t work together and thus have Canadians rationing vaccines!
3263	110591	My hunch is that a lot of EU expats got their #vaccination in their home countries, like me (though I then got my GP in Brussels to register my jabs in the Belgian system)
3264	108346	I’m going to get my COVID Shots soon but I need to take my time with that. It’s fairly obvious that vaccines work but not all the time, which is why you take your time getting them. I became very sick and more autistic from vaccines but the stabilized versions do work.
3265	109785	Well if distancing and masks are still needed then the vaccine obviously doesn’t work!                          And if virus doesn’t stimulate immunity then the vaccine won’t work!
3266	111700	@timacheson @MaizyDaizyZzzz There goes getting COVID-19 under control  Especially with those South American numbers I bet they get the vaccine before US citizens like they have done in the UK  Yes Britain has the same problem and liberals suggesting mainland Europe is not safe for immediate
3267	110321	@thelionrawrson @Conserve321 @GovAndyBeshear Science will tell you that children don't get sick from coronavirus. Science will also tell you the vaccine does not stop the spread it just lessens the symptoms. If kids don't generally have symptoms what is the vaccine for?
3268	111708	@Abba_Annabelle @funder Between fighting Covid-19 and ignorance, it is easier to get the vaccine since it is very difficult to talk to an ignorant person.
3269	112544	How to convince a conservative to get the vaccine:What? You want me to pay for YOUR ICU bed because you didn't take PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY and get vaccinated? You are so ENTITLED #cdnpoli #antivaxxers #covid19 #CovidIsNotOver
3270	108387	@johnthefocuser @j88KBF @zev_dr The vaccine renders the coronavirus a non issue. It’s for the greater good to have it. Please do when the time comes.
3271	107882	Or until you decide to give up your power, which everyone with a brain knows you never will.This is not about the vaccine, this is about control.
3272	112610	@heatherschatz @WJCTNews Thanks for work on this.My two-bits --&gt; If no definitive vaccine in 2020 for #covid19, we would be best using resources to help restaurant workers transition to things we need today.
3273	112563	@2000Nhgt @brad224 @JoyceWhiteVance All my loved ones are vaxxed. If I had young children, I would rarely go out—and would go NOWHERE w/o absolute precautions. I worked too hard to get my kids and would die for them w/o a second thought, #COVID19 #FullyVaccinated
3274	109409	Say no to Chinese vaccines. China hasn't explained how they let coronavirus get out of control. They lied from the beginning. Now they want us to take their vaccines 😫
3275	110621	Layering and masking up with my quarantine buddy to go stand in line for a vaccine. I live in one of the zip codes and qualify under the 1B criteria. I really hope that when we get there, the line is obnoxiously long bc folks are wanting to get vaccinated.
3276	108691	Covid-19  I just cannot take the governments seriously, not while they are still allowing anybody to fly all over the world, I am not getting any more vaccinations until they stop toying with us, they wont trust the vaccines, neither will I.
3277	202067	I got vaccinated, but it’s my choice and not anyone else’s. #EducateDontMandate #vaccine #COVID19 #FJB #LetsGoBrandon
3278	107984	If we are healthy then world will be healthy he says. Pandemic has no cure or vaccine says @narendramodi Keep away from crowds and maintain social distancing. It is v necessary to practice as it will play a big role in combating this pandemic
3279	110462	@DrMadej I am a Korean. He has one son and he is a Christian.. I don't have faith in vaccines either. I hate vaccines. The distrust of covid19 vaccines in particular is very big.
3280	110080	Ethically &amp; morally the right decision.  Especially if the US already has enough supplies. I'll actually think we need to be proactively working with health institution to make sure vaccines gets to everyone. This action is a form of leadership and a lesson about our character
3281	111678	Lol what? You've been keeping morale of the populace up by telling everyone the vaccine was the answer, and life would return to normal. Well, now we have the vaccine, and you're telling us the pandemic still isn't over and to still follow all the precautions?? Get bent.
3282	109571	I'm so glad I don't have to deal with the possibility of being at school for 🗣️ IN-PERSON CLASSES IN A GLOBAL PANDEMIC WHILE THERE IS NO VACCINE OUT YET. 🗣️I'd nope tf out if I found out someone I shared a classroom with got coronavirus.Risking myself &amp; family is not the move.
3283	110946	actually that's not so accurate.. we can get infected again with other strains because the virus is always mutating, and mutating very fast. That's why Moderna started on making improved vaccine for #COVID21 group. In Aug 2020 already 29 #COVID19 strains were found in Malaysia
3284	109672	"@BrexitStewart  We trusted a dodgy ""Scientific model"" which has proven to be dramatically flawed. Yet we are pressing ahead with a vaccine, why? There is plenty of evidence to the contrary, which states a vaccine is not needed. Who decides if we need the vaccine?"
3285	108173	It could be a blessing in disguise. More opportunities will come my way. My greatest achievement was getting into the University of Edinburgh Law School. I am very proud. Sadly, I think I have to defer until next year when there is a COVID-19 vaccine.
3286	110243	"The ""no way we have a vaccine this year"" to 2.1 million vaccines initiated in first 2 weeks of rollout and extrapolating that out years ahead is an interesting new narrative."
3287	202296	Not wanting an untested vaccine in my, or my family’s, body is now “extremist”.  If this doesn’t dissuade you from this vaccine, nothing will.
3288	110362	@GiuseppeConteIT @robersperanza Several scholars have been raising warning flags about this imminent possibility in respect to the coronavirus vaccines aggressively being rolled-out, particularly the Bill Gates-backed Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
3289	202109	Mom and Dad got the jab. I'm so happy. Im the last family member to get the #vaccine. #COVID19 #vaccines #covidNL
3290	112024	@GobiernodeChile Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
3291	110786	Where is the “science” to mandate vaccines for kids but not for teachers? So a Governor who is NOT a physician or scientist won’t go against the unions? This is so wrong. #vaccinemandates
3292	111503	I think in Ireland we should do something similar but swap the inmates for the idiots marching in Dublin against lockdown and vaccine Clean to covid wards without PPE and if they refuse stop their dole #COVIDIOTS
3293	112484	@UBI4UandI @EricTopol The #COVID19 #vaccine is free for all Americans.What is going on @US_FDA defies simple explanation. But we should all ask why @POTUS hasn't named an FDA Commissioner. Leadership matters, especially in a #pandemic .
3294	110290	@laurenmill3r93 It doesn't change the fact its a human experimentation, hacking our bodies, never before this synthetic DNA or RNA has been tested on humans. There has been already many deaths reported but clearly they died cuz of covid19 and not this so called vaccine.
3295	108800	@RichieAllenShow My main problem with the vaccine- if they haven't yet tested for a virus, but genetic material, then the virus can't possibly be what they say it is. SO- what exactly are they trying to force on people?? What is in that syringe? #StopTheNonsense  #COVID19 #KBF
3296	109039	@Chadwick_Moore If I get a #COVID19 vaccine I will identify as a castrated, beta sheep.But I prefer being an #alpha biological male #dragqueen 💅🏻
3297	110248	@feraljokes If the unused vaccines go in a dumpster, the dumpster will be locked, just like it is at the grocery store. Also, COVID-19 vaccines actually *are* expiring unused and being thrown out.
3298	108222	Gonna commit all the crimes leaving behind tons of my DNA just to get the vaccine and then change my DNA.
3299	109194	This is only an observation from practice..has anyone else seen a #HSV episode after a person has reported having their #COVID19 #vaccine recently? Any research done on this?
3300	201834	@T_Bloyd @jspalding79 @GovAndyBeshear The vaccine that my neighbor received earlier this year yet still tested positive for Covid-19 last week.  Oh that vaccine?
3301	107818	I've added my name to a queue for the COVID-19 vaccine through my employer. All of the people who need it first will get it, but I am relieved to have started the process! I'll happily wait my turn while our first responders and most vulnerable are vaccinated.
3302	108396	@atrupar What does he even know about the coronavirus vaccine? Someone should ask him. It sounds like in order for the vaccine to be effective, a person would need two doses of the vaccine for it to be effective. So like a vaccine and then a booster?
3303	111514	I am an expert in logistics and distribution in the province of Ontario and would like to offer my expertise to the vaccine task force
3304	110203	@CobbSchools great news!If you’re serious about “encouraging vaccination”, it’s time to set up vaccine clinics, like many other metro school districts have done. Make it easy for parents to get their kids vaxxed, making school safer for everyone. No time to waste⬇️
3305	108859	On my way to get my first shot of the Covid-19 Vaccine!Im not a fan of needles. But it needs to get done.
3306	111641	@Porter_Anderson @PeterHotez @Acosta @JoeBiden Those who launched Covid-19 Pandemic as Great Reset of the world, they will not end this pandemic until they fulfil their targets in changing the world to the new world they want &amp; maybe this is why they are against Dr.Hotez vaccine because it’s effective &amp; may eradicate pandemic
3307	110551	The government has had since December 31st 2019 to come up with a plan for us in multiple scenarios, what are they actually doing, this thing aint going away and a vaccine is not arriving tomorrow
3308	202232	PM @narendramodi Ji got the first  dose of Covid-19 vaccine this morning. My appeal to all Corona warriors who are yet to get the vaccine and all those eligible for 2nd phase to take the vaccine. Let us make India &amp; Andhra Pradesh Covid-19 free.@BJP4India @BJYM @JPNadda https://t.co/qEPUgevlgZ
3309	111652	Sorry for the barrage of negative news but I truly don't think many people understand what we are dealing with here.  I'm praying for a vaccine so we can get our lives back to normal.
3310	108328	@OregonGovBrown @OHAOregon What on earth did you think was going to happen? Oregonians will not stand for your tyranny any longer. If vaccines work, why are you shutting down? This is the WRONG way to motivate people to get vaccinated. You are out of touch with reality.
3311	110863	@ann_eann @MrStevenCree @caitrionambalfe Exactly. My understanding is that you may still get exposed to COVID-19 but the vaccine lessens the severity of the symptoms. Ultimately, isn’t that what it’s all about? Not overwhelming the hospitals when they have a limited number of ICU beds, ventilators and staff to run them?
3312	108483	"Unfortunately, yes.  You cannot take the Mark of the Beast. Staying away from the vaccine is critical. Please DO NOT get vaccinated. It is not a vaccine at all. This is a deception to capture souls while the world chants ""COVID"" or ""DIVOC"" and evil spirits latch on to the Godless"
3313	109148	Boorah for @realDonaldTrump - We do not want to follow a corrupt organization like the WHO! They are heavily influenced by the Communist Chinese Party! They want to force the world to take vaccines &amp; that is NOT possible! Too much unrest to get it done!
3314	108034	I worked in a research lab in a hospital and went to a patient floor ONCE A WEEK. I had to have antibody testing, get vaccines I didn't already have, and have boosters for others.If I didn't - NO JOB!If you don't believe in science why work in health care?😡
3315	111322	This is excellent. Every teacher who feels uncomfortable in the classroom should be offered a vaccine now so that we can get school back in person, five days a week, ASAP.
3316	202059	Lost my shit with the '5g causes Covid19 and Bill Gates wants to tag us all with a vaccine' girl this morning on FB.
3317	107725	The insert in flu vaccines said getting the vax made one 36% more likely to get Coronavirus, so Oz is right.
3318	110828	@RepBalderson #republicans are supporting an insane president #trump who is blocking YOUR #covidreliefbill  YOU will get NO #VACCINE , NO #UNEMPLOYMENTBenefits No aid for #hospitals #FrontLineHeroes NO #stimuluscheck They let #covid19 spread now they want us homeless and starving #COVIDrelief
3319	108069	Now that the #mainstream media has called the #USElection, I won’t be surprised if an effective vaccine for #COVIDー19 is swiftly found or the #virus suddenly disappears altogether ...#USElectionResults2020 #coronavirus #Lockdown2 #Trump
3320	109597	Vaccines vs variants. This is an example of why I rant like I do about vaccines not getting into arms fast enough, it literally is a race. Whether the vaccines are effective against this variant is unknown, but so far they have been effective against others.
3321	112073	Covid-19 vaccines are like prayers. Even if you commit 100%, you still need to do everything like a person who commits 0% for them to work.
3322	108734	The entire family is waking up early to try to get my grandpa an earlier COVID-19 vaccine appointment. They have him scheduled for June right now.
3323	108315	@coronavirus @coronavirus Thank you for nearly ruining my life and hopefully this new vaccine will eternally destroy the stupid shit coronavirus
3324	112094	@tburages I am so sorry @tburages. Truly. This is devastating. You are pro-#vaccine, and now struggling w this death in your family. An idiosyncratic reaction to anything like a vaccine or a medicine is possible. Yet on a global scale the vaccine is saving millions of lives. See👇
3325	107762	@matthewjdowd 💯% Precisely.Besides, Coronavirus Vaccine has been in the process for nearly ten years.
3326	111240	My mum (62y) has tested positive with Covid-19 for the first time after getting vaccinated by four days, would I blame on vaccine for weakening her immune system or thank vaccine for bearing this disease.
3327	108921	@matthewstoller Theres never been an effective coronavirus vaccine for humans. Maybe this will be the 1st...
3328	109810	Listen folks, I am triple vaxxed, my whole family besides my 3 year-old too. I am fairly left in my politics. But this is bullshit and such a slippery slope.
3329	109237	@GeoffRBennett @maggieNYT TRUMP COULD PASS A VACCINE TODAY FOR VOTES 🇷🇺 BUT PROBLEM IS THE VACCINE'S GOTTA WORK AND TRUMP CAN'T BURN OUT COVID19 LIKE PUTIN JUST DID.. #SNAKEOIL @PTPGOfficial @IntlCrimCourt @HouseJudiciary @allontheline @ICCT_TheHague
3330	110528	My wife is a rheumatologist and has a masters in epidemiology. She tried to enroll our kids in the vaccine trials. That didn't pan out so we'll have to settle for as soon as they're eligible.
3331	108656	COVID-19 vaccine #AZD1222 showed robust immune responses in all participants in Phase I/II trial. #AstraZeneca is not making any profit on this. 🇬🇧🇸🇪
3332	108909	the two questions:why is this vaccine different from all other vaccines?why in all other pandemics do we act like normal humans but in this pandemic, we act like idiots?
3333	110305	So the Moderna Vaccine is 95% effective against COVID. These companies like to play it safe so chances are it’s 110% effective. Soon as it drop, I need y’all to line up for it like y’all did the PS5. Take the vaccine and stfu about Corona and masks and social distancing. Thx
3334	108901	@Trinhnomics Why would anyone under 70 take or need a vaccine not to mention an mRNA any mention big ADE coronavirus??? Humans so much to learn... Wake the hell up
3335	111556	There are lots of reasons not to want to get a #covid19 vaccine.But none of them are any good.#VaccinesWork
3336	109707	@genesimmons @FoREVer_A_BAT and @jerogan  If everyone got the vaccine they wouldn't have to worry about getting or spreading the virus. If they were to get the covid-19 virus and they had been vaccinated, their case would be very mild or asymptomatic.
3337	202351	This'll take 5 minutes of your time if you track 👌🏾 (I religiously track mine as my migraines fall in line with my cycle!) - my cycle length changed after my first vaccine &amp; my first worry was impact on my migraines! This is important research for many reasons...
3338	112102	@HoarseWisperer Actually, some good news on the vaccine front with Moderna, with rumors saying more good news later this week on the Oxford vaccine. It would be destiney if on the day Biden takes office, multiple companies announce Covid-19 vaccines. Hey, we can all dream, right?!?
3339	109610	@karlamarie171 @aubrey_huff I don't know if you are or not. It sounded like you weren't going to get either of the covid19 vaccines. Did I misunderstand you?
3340	112633	How does that work? I mean you said we can still get covid if we get the jab so we can still get delata too,right? You keep contradicting yourself. Wth?
3341	202379	UPDATE:As a frontline NHS worker I was lucky enough to receive my first dose of the Covid vaccine last weekI can honestly say I’ve had ZERO side effectsI am proud to be doing my bit for my patients, community and wider public.Please go for yours when invited!#COVID19 https://t.co/8qamZY1KVq
3342	202427	I got the first dose of the AstraZeneca Vaccine 💉 against Covid-19 today at exactly 11:15am. Well, no side effect so far.  Kindly go for the jab cos it’s safe to be vaccinated.

3347	111153	@_DBirkhead @TechCrunch @kirstenkorosec Prioritizing profit over lives... greed. I used to be a big Tesla fan, but I can't help it.

3348	109925	I tweeted about this 2 hours ago, hoping the VA would move to a COVID vaccine mandate: voila! Ok, lucky timing on my end, but this is great. As the largest healthcare system in the US, this is huge. Grateful the VA is following the science. #VaccinesWork
3349	112138	@Bodyfatcoach @thehill @marcorubio You need to Google what a vaccine actually does and what a cure is. They are very different in what they are meant to do. The Covid-19 vaccine isn’t meant to be a cure!

3353	109595	How will they know if the vaccines are good unless they open everything up and stop mask wearing and social distancing etc.All these measures being in place  after all adults vaccinated is not going to give them the answers they are looking for surely? #vaccines #COVID19

3360	108301	@THEWRENCHLEFT @charliekirk11 It's not a vaccine quackie doctor.   They didn't even isolate the virus. They never could. They've been trying this on the oldest coronavirus in the book!!   The common cold.  Now tell me how is this PCR test possibly even accurate.

3395	112396	@CNN @drsanjaygupta Just now GOD/ALLAH/SHIV has suggested one mentioned below vaccine for this Coronavirus ---------  Don't visit any Church, Mosque &amp; Temple...until you permanently QUIT Smoking, Alcohol, Drug, PORN, Premarital Sex/Extramarital affairs.
3396	110251	Police please, please remove the police and vaccinate restaurant workers if you're going to insist they go back to work! #COVIDIOT #COVID19 #CovidVaccine #DefundThePolice
3397	110035	It may get to a point where the only way to not get #coronavirus due to multiple strains is to never leave your home because it will take a long time to come up with viable vaccines for all variants
3398	111762	@VoiceOfFranky @kinsellawarren Actually, we don't know if a vaccine is on the way. Remember there was a vaccine (Lymerix) for Lyme disease in the 1990s, but it turned out to be too flawed. 25 years later there still isn't one.Maybe there'll never be a vaccine for COVID-19 either? We just don't know.

3400	108045	@meenaharris @mayaharris_  @PadmaLakshmi @mindykaling we need videos like to this to explain the vaccine in simple terms to common folk. Please amplify this so that we can get more jabs/day and combat vaccine ignorance.
3401	111219	Mr President, can you just get us a vaccine and stop this childish tweet. It took you forever to take the #COVID19 threat serious and now you're tweeting rubbish. Act like a president of free world and wake up from your slumber please.
3402	110532	So thinking about how you need to find a carrier (antigen) to get the virus in the body in the vaccine, let's talk about COVID-19 and vaccines. #NESBC2020
3403	108351	It's my two week anniversary with dose #2 of the COVID-19 vaccine. We're very happy together. Amazed by science, grateful for frontline workers and my health.💉+ 👧🏼 = ❤️I'd like to pre-order my booster shot now because I never want to do this again😅
3404	112931	I cannot believe how many uneducated fucks are claiming they refuse to have the COVID vaccine because they have not found a cure for cancer (a disease) but that there is a cure for coronavirus (A VIRUS!!) 🤯
3405	110434	You denied us Super Computer, thinking we will never make it. We did.You denied us Cryogenic Engine, thinking we will never make it.We did.You are denying us Raw Materials for COVID19 Vaccines, thinking we will not be able to make it.Guess what, we will make it again.@POTUS

3407	201984	I was being a responsible adult this year; I got caught up with my vaccines, got my much needed dental work, I was about to go to an eye doctor for glasses, and I was saving up for an apartment on top of it all. But the coronavirus had other plans.
3408	202132	I got my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine last week. I urge every one to get theirs as soon as it is offered.  It's our chance to return to normal and save those who are vulnerable!
3409	110326	@simonnread The country is COVID19 weary.As palliative nurse I've seen the virus effects first hand. We have to do what we have to do to stop the spread whilst the vaccine is rolled out.  #christmasiscancelled #StaySafe #StayHome An end to this is just on the horizon. #BeKind #Christmas
3410	111256	The vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna set off a persistent immune reaction in the body that may protect against the coronavirus for years, scientists reported on Monday.  NY Times
3411	111947	@johnsonave You didn’t repaid to any of my concerns. Something not being new doesn’t mean it’s safe and good in the long term. Also, mRNA is new as far as injection into humans. Another also, The other coronavirus vaccines were abject failures, and all vaccines have inherent risk.
3412	107947	@LarryOConnor This is just Fauci's way of admitting that he, like 50% of the NIH staff did not get the Covid-19 vaccine
3413	110797	Is Russia first to a Covid-19 vaccine? Not so fast.  Strange how come China did not have any comment for Russia which they claimed they have the vaccine first w/o even approved? Seriously, if now the US claimed that they have the vaccine first then China will definitely comment
3414	201954	@rachneil34 @RoloWimbush @nickystevo @rachneil34 Hey thanks v much for following me still i know I've not been around my #mentalhealth has been pushed as I've not seen my family + friends for a year so its caught me out as normally i can cope i feel bit better as had #COVID19 #vaccine  #benwimbushSCORD #quadriplegic
3415	110162	Rather arrogant aren't you! If the prov governments had mandated vaccines for all those of age and distributed rapid test kits earlier then we may have had a chance to get out of this pandemic sooner. And not having paid sick days was unconscionable for those in low paying jobs.
3416	202050	@kyrstensinema That being said i already had Covid19 and it only reduced my smell and taste. Now i have antibodies to Covid19. I still took the vaccine which didn't hurt me either. Also took the flu shot and booster from Pfizer. The main thing it was my choice and that's what America is about.
3417	108552	Tbf the headline is accurate. I just read ‘Coronavirus’ and ‘vaccine’ and jumped to my own conclusions
3418	108827	Want no anti-vaxxer “it’s my opinion” BS on my TL today. We’ve lost so many loved ones to COVID-19 that we can’t not take a chance on the vaccine. It’s not a guarantee, but it sure as hell is a better fail safe than getting critically sick or dying.  #VaccineRollOutSA

3421	110854	@catturd2 I am human so a PSA from a dog and I mean any dog will not move me to do what I don't want to do.  You are equating a four legged animal to a human.  While it's catchy for some it is still a dog.  Last time   I checked dogs aren't getting Coronavirus or vaccines.
3422	108925	This is deeply concerning. 3 times in the last week I’ve been asked by my over 80’s clients when they will be getting their vaccine. What do I tell them? @fmwales doesn’t want to rush it?? Disgraceful.
3423	110703	My bigger concerning is that nobody knows how long the vaccine last effective, not even CDC. If this is something we have to get every 6months or less, there's going to be huge delay of plan bc then whoever categorized in high risk group needs their second shot around summer.
3424	111347	can we speed up the COVID-19 vaccine so I can get in on my 21st birthday because that would be the best thing that ever happened to me in my lifetime
3425	111356	This is really fucking sad- people are so #selfish and since they think it’s a hoax, they needed the #COVIDIOT #VACCINE.
3426	109953	Seemed like a good healthy man.  Surprised people believe their are computer chips are in vaccines.  Then again you can create a religion centuries ago and people today will follow just by word of mouth.  Sad times

3431	107848	#BillGates history with population control and Planned Parenthood should tell you all you need to know about why you do not take any vaccine that he is involved with.
3432	111881	@izzie_izabel @CahillKellie It’s because no long term side effects have been tested. You get the vaccine now and don’t get COVID-19 which is good, but what if the trade off down the line is mitochondrial dysfunction? Nervous system damage? Especially since this vaccine/virus works with mRNA.
3433	108480	I will be having my Flu jab as normal &amp; this year so will my 2 year old for the first time - it’s never been so important to protect ourselves, our loved ones, patients &amp; people in general #InThisTogether #FluVaccine #COVID19 #flu #StaySafeStayHealthy #prevetion #PHEHealthMatters
3434	108991	@brianma68 @Jamestrex @ben_butler1992 @piersmorgan Are you out of your mind?? How long does it usually take to develop a vaccine? Never mind the fact that FOUR coronavirus are already in circulation, and how long did it take to produce a vaccine for these, the now common cold? Exactly. I’m no Tory, but please get a grip!
3435	202211	@impact_gov @impact_gov  I just registered my family  and myself to receive the #Covid19 vaccine in #Lebanon Since day 1 through the @impact_gov platform.Please register so we can beat Covid and be able to hug our loved ones again. The process took me less than 1 minute.
3436	109579	@squawkying @TraceyOMahony81 She says Covid19 is like the flu? It is not, the R numbers are different for a start R0 for the flu is 1.3 R0 value for covid19 is 2 to 3, there is no vaccine for covid19, there is for the flu. Honestly using Dolores a woman with a failed science career is not a good idea :)
3437	110395	"""They've put Covid-19 in the new flu jabs, please do not take them. Don't ask me for sources. Do your own research."" LOOL how can you say this with such conviction... Too much coke and conspiracy sessions."

3439	108635	@AJA_scenarios does the COVID-19 vaccine after injected  in the human could make the immune system to produce self variant  proteins or incubated viruses that does not affect the person who carry it but  may be transmitted within the respiratory system and affect others ?
3440	111815	Democratic leadership has called for a COVID-19 vaccine to be ‘free and accessible to everyone,’ the Trump admin has only said that ‘vulnerable’ Americans would be given the vaccine for free.

3442	108539	"@SarahD31523908 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump If you take the gamble then that is your choice. There is no treatment on the mass market, no vaccine, one day COVID19 with have a cure and we can go back to normal but until then you have a duty to yourself to reduce risk. If you don't,  you can't then say ""its not my fault"""
3443	108662	Interesting , don’t think 🇬🇧 is  doing any post vaccine testing?We should, it’s important monitoring data
3444	109134	We need to be on the lookout for an effective foreign-made #coronavirus #COVID19 #vaccine because this administration would 100% suppress the news if it competes with an American company that #Trump has investments in
3445	112649	@for_seagazer @_EMazing @emmy_angelle Yeah, the problem with vaccines in the past is they rarely got any attention or funding.  Hell, there was a vaccine in the works for I think MERS, which is another Coronavirus and it got it's funding pulled because politicians didn't think it was worth the time or money.  Idiots.
3446	109770	My only opinion on the vaccine is this: I got one shot Sunday &amp; I’ll get another May 2nd. I’ve got people close to me who have contracted Covid-19 &amp; suffered &amp; people in my house with immunity issues so I’m going the safer than sorry route &amp; I’m 100% confident in my decision.
3447	109370	@FRANK_SINATRA7 @Breaking911 All the shots are booster shots. If one is vaccinated they would have sterlization immunity. They would not pass on or get sick from the virus. Hence reality is there is no vaccine for this virus. Highly unlikely there will be a vaccine for a coronavirus anytime soon if ever.
3448	202108	As of yesterday, 56.5% of the UK's population have had  one Covid-19 vaccine dose and 33% have had both doses. An incredible achievement.
3449	112388	People getting outraged by this.. Vaccines don't make you immune, just makes you more resistant to the infection.COVID-19 isn't going away, just like the flu.
3450	107976	get'er done folks. Let's go beach whaling! Would u like to join me? Tons of food, sun, camaraderie and fun, but if you like to be trim, jogging on the shore or swimming will keep u healthier!#CoronavirusPandemic #VaccinesSaveLives
3451	107905	Face it right now - if we do not inaugurate #PresidentJoeBiden Jan 2021, we have NO WAY through this. Would you take a vaccine touted by this admin? Would u ever give it to your children - (no trials being done on children yet?) Honestly, I would not. #JoeBiden2020 is our hope!
3452	110275	Hold on. #immune45 may figure out a way to make a buck from coronavirus and get involved big time. A fake vaccine?
3453	111276	1.1 Billion people across the continent need the mechanism to get vaccines. Until we all come together to make sure they get it we're never going to get rid of COVID.
3454	109064	@mynameisme91 Thank you! He’s the MAN!This virus has a bunch of mutation, which helps in getting to a universal coronavirus vaccine, but can sometimes be catastrophic.He just relieved so much anxiety.
3455	111197	@aznananc @JesseUno @TulsiGabbard The vaccine is meant to prevent serious illness. If the elderly do get it, they don’t get sick. The vaccine does not prevent COVID-19 from spreading.
3456	111448	Fort Detrick has the vaccine. (They had already been injecting soldiers with MERS vaccine in Summer 2019).
3457	109628	I work in health policy, am immunosuppressed. I’ve had my first #CovidVaccine, can’t wait for my second and my 4 year old child will be vaccinated as soon as a vaccine is approved for his age because #VaccinesWork #cdnpoli
3458	108631	Like any epidemic, there are still only three options to keep it under an epidemic threshold1. Indefinite lockdown2. A vaccine3. Enough immunity
3459	110710	To be absolutely clear: Get the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine as soon as you can. It is right the experts are investigating, but almost certainly there is no real issue here, and even if there is an issue, we know it's very rare. The risk of getting Covid-19 and dying is worse.
3460	110937	This is sad. I’ve been rooting for all the vaccines. I’ll be shocked if it gets approved here in the US...
3461	109313	@Altxk @tariqtramboo You should get one serologic(antibody) test done cuz according to CDC, If someone who has had COVID-19 recently wants to take the vaccine, then ideally, that person should do so anytime between one to three months after symptom resolution, following infection with SARS-.CoV-2
3462	108230	If we pay attention  to people like @BDUTT  we give them importance .yeh l trend ke bhooke h..bas dhayan dena band kar do. they are worse then coronavirus ,corna does have a vaccine in future but people like this dont #barkha repeat #sushant was not bipolar #UddhavResignOrCBI4SSR
3463	112191	"Joe Biden is God, I just heard him say ""He is not going to shutdown"" the Economy, he is going to Shutdown the CoronaVirus! Does this make anyone else think, he's been secretly working with a vaccine company in SECRET?"

3467	110661	Had my 3rd jab.I choose to get it for 2 reasons. To protect my family as my wife is middle risk. And if there's any chance that we can escape covid I'll do what I can to help prevent it.#COVID19 #OmicronVirus #Pfizer #GetBoosted #GetVaccinated
3468	109316	This is why myself and my family won’t be having this vaccine. We’ve managed perfectly well without it all this time, and it’s not going to give us our freedom back anyhow. No thanks @BorisJohnson
3469	108743	This is why anyone with a half-functioning brain knows the thing about a widely-distributed, effective vaccine in the next couple of months is... well... bullshit
3470	108103	I I think getting a vaccine developed is a good idea – vaccines have saved a lot of lives and this is a very weird virus we can’t hide out for three years.  I’ll take them back soon because I want to see my grandma!
3471	108142	Since so many red-staters don’t want their vaccines, why can’t those of who may need a booster just take theirs right now?
3472	111829	I'm confused. As far as I am aware these vaccines do not prevent acquiring OR spreading the virus.The conflicting information is troubling to me which is why I'm waiting and NOT getting a vaccine.Media, medical, and government need to pick a lane #ldnont @fordnation @WHO
3473	112241	From what I'm reading, it looks like the coronavirus vaccine process is going to be in multiple waves over the course of years. The first vaccines will only give temporary immunity and the population will have to be revaccinated every few months or every year.
3474	109485	So it looks like people are going to be forced to get the covid-19 vaccine if they want to go to college or keep certain jobs, it seems like none of the representatives in office are doing anything to stop it.
3475	108407	#unitedstates, please get vaccinated. The #vaccine is 95% immune to #coronavirus . Every #american can be 95% immune to #COVID if we all work together
3476	111767	I can’t imagine how are the Americans allowing this lunatic out in the open. Even a tyrant Putin is vociferously against vaccine mandate but the gold standard of democracy has resorted to coercion and force! Shameful
3477	110972	Second wave.  🤷‍♂️ It won't end here. There will be another, 3rd wave after this one.Until we have a working vaccine, it will just keep coming, killing us.We KNOW how to slow it down.So why don't we follow medical advice?🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
3478	107735	Just felt my heart sink when I realized we’re gonna get hit with a deluge of coronavirus vaccine truthers.
3479	109340	@EmaGabrielaS @IngrahamAngle The premise here is completely wrong. We know the flu has a shelf life, and we have new vaccines for it every year.This is a NOVEL CORONAVIRUS. That means we have never seen it before and that we have no immunity to it. Also we still don't know how well survivors will get along.
3480	108714	I find it frustrating that people didn’t get the vaccine UNTIL it affected them personally. Not doing it out of wanting to protect everyone around them and themselves, but until they were affected.
3481	112746	this most likely will be what ppl will get every year, like the flu vaccine. new boosters for variants. this vaccine is still in “trial stage” and they don’t wanna admit it
3482	107893	We need to make the #CovidVaccine mandatory.  Those that don’t want to take can move to #Detroit , can’t fuck that place up.  They can then play the herd immunity game with each other.  Once #COVID is gone they can return to society.  ##COVID19

3484	108736	Okay. If the #vaccine has to be 80 degrees below while shipped &amp; stored. Will they pull it straight from freezer to administer? Wont that be like a hotshot only backwards? How will that feel???? #COVID19 #COVID19Vaccine
3485	107815	@TheAnswerer1 they may be. no vaccine is going to work against a coronavirus. that's why they have new ones each year for new strains. that and the $$ it generates. And of course, if JJ sees everyone else getting paid on the booster train, they are jumping on board.
3486	109809	Allowing #Covid19 to spread uncontrolled across US is just prolonging the pandemic. And we are creating perfect conditions for a worse variant to be created that will evade the vaccine even further.It feels like US is on suicide mission and taking whole world down with us.
3487	107998	Why are people tweeting about the covid vaccine with “JUSTSAYNO” included in their tweetsOh right, they’re idiots who think Covid-19 is a lie. I forgot.
3488	112167	I still wear my mask inside places. It doesn't take much for me to do that for other people.We know vaccines only help ourselves, that's what all vaccines do, they protect the person who gets the jab but we still have to stop the virus from spreading.
3489	110037	@FCN2go Ya.. this is how they SECRETLY give you this so called vaccine for the Covid19. Plus whatever else they have in mind or up their sleeves.
3490	110073	"We have called this ""Data Tax"" for a good reason. If you are poor and have no money, and you don't get a Vaccine, then people get that it is cruelty. But if you refuse to part w/ your data, and don't get a Vaccine, it might be called Kindness and people may not notice."
3491	112318	* Gates and Fauci PREDICTED President Trump would face a global outbreak.* Gates gets a Patent on Coronavirus. * Gates DEMANDS population reduction by 95% via vaccine.* Gates already has a Coronavirus vaccine ready for use!  #ChinaVirus #GatesVirus #Globalism at work‼️
3492	112937	Why ffs!? A gorilla coughs, they swipe it with a pcr swab (probably false positive) then create a vaccine for it....WTF!
3493	111307	So now we have famous musicians trying to encourage people NOT to get vaccinated? I don't even know what to say anymore. There are vaccine mandates for other vaccines, and COVID should be no different! I can't believe there are parents out there who won't get their kids vaccinate
3494	110638	So what if we don't get a viable vaccine or medication in the immediate future and it takes 2, 5, 10 years? Or worse, we never get one.
3495	108251	We’ve had a vaccine for a good 6 months now?I can’t &amp; won’t have any sympathy for them anymore. If they’d rather listen to an ex reality tv actor, twice impeached *president than DOCTORS &amp; SCIENTISTS, may God have mercy on their soul🤷🏼‍♀️

3503	112598	@LBC @NickFerrariLBC This is not about a virus, this is about getting EVERY man,woman &amp; child to accept Digital ID’s (sold to you as vaccine passport)so they can impliment their financial reset &amp; social credit scoring (China style) covid19 is just their tool to get you to accept it.
3504	108292	@Astartiel @JustMarilyn7 @KitterleCathy My concern is considering this is a coronavirus (the same kind that are common colds) that they won’t be able to make a vaccine that is effective. We don’t have them for common cold coronaviruses. I am hopefully, for good treatment options though.
3505	109433	Yeah, but it’s Biden’s vaccine rollout that violates muh freedumb, so we certainly won’t get vaccinated. Plus, having a national healthcare system is socialism. So I guess we’ll just have to get sick pay for it out of pocket.Makes sense, don’t it?*Sarcasm*
3506	107830	@thegriffin666 @RichardDawkins Since you are some kind of expertise in this field. Do you think that it is likely, that the world’s population of humans get vaccinated. Before the vaccines available will be outdated, due to new Covid-19 mutations. Like the common flu virus?
3507	112244	@Daily_Express @susannareid100 Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks.

3508	108903	It is not necessarily a question of antibodies.It is about how our T-cells function.There is doubt, that it's advisable to have a jab, if you have had Covid19 infection, as your immune system could go into overdrive (Cytokine Storm/ ADE).Q: How long does immunity last?

In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including deaths if my idea doesn't work.
3515	111796	Good God @joethevoter #lie : Vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus. #coronavirus #moronavirus #covidiots
3516	112211	Vivid  virus has never ever been isolated how are they testing for it ?????????They aren’t and they can not !WAKE UP - YOU HAVE ALL BEEN FOOLED !The vaccine is the virus!
3517	110289	Vaccine is the main tool to fight against this PANDEMIC BUT rich and powerful countries have continued with their nationalist approach, vaccinating under 25s when healthcare &amp; frontline workers around the world havenot had any. #Morality #Justice @POTUS @JoeBiden @WHO @DrTedros
3518	109642	@gold18002 @POTUS When the Influenza Vaccine came out, no one was ever forced to take it so why would they want to force us to take the COVID-19 Vaccine...Tim your statement doesn't make sense at all.  My grandkids were able to say NO at their job and they are still working so where is the force?
3519	110544	Interesting notes:Initially, vaccines protect the individual—it’s not until larger percentages of the population get it that it reduces population-wide rates.People with #COVID19 antibodies should still get the vaccine.

3521	112778	@GPrime85 @Fynnderella1 The flu is an RNA virus that could've been eradicated if most people got the vaccine. Just like the coronavirus.

3523	108860	If those effers in other provinces steal our vaccines after we put in all of the hard work this past year(+) and they did practically nothing, and cause us to continue doing hard work while they are vaccinated I will lose my goddamn shit
3524	109644	Do we think vaccine is the solution against corona? Do people in every country need not REPENT of their SINS? Why not try solutions on bended knees my people.

3526	111184	I've heard, here on twitter, people suggesting that Bill Gates is responsible for covid19 &amp; that the vaccine is just a way of getting us all chipped like we do to our pets. Just crazy what they come up with.
3527	202151	I got a flu shot for the first time this year and got the flu pretty bad approx 1.2 wks later, lasting just shy of a month. So if I were to need a covid vaccine what's the chances I'm basicly being stabbed with coronavirus?
3528	110826	On this #InternationalWomensDay I would appreciate a RT! I’ve put my heart, soul, and body into this #COVID19 vaccine trial series
3529	112632	These spikes are crucial to the virus’s ability to infect and spread. Because spikes are such an integral part of the virus, it is unlikely that any variants will not have them. Therefore, the vaccine will work against them too! Go science! #COVID19
3530	111853	@ObeyWide @HighWireTalk Yes it's called animal testing. They have never successfully developed a vaccine for the common cold (animals usually die when introduced to the wild virus)That's what a coronavirus is. Now they have to test on humans to further the research. Your statement was partially correct.
3531	112400	Did coronavirus come from a lab? Or a seafood market? https://t.co/8OmJqgzqJ5 My Research and Development is on and the vaccine will be out soon. China has the vaccine. Why the world doesn’t ? Why the world is under a pandemic?We are living in the 21st century. We have a cure💭
3532	109819	Good thread on vaccine testing, retweet to any unquestioning vax advocates night make them think (if they could be bothered to read).
3533	110371	A literal miracle of science. Can’t wait to get my vaccine later this spring or early summer when it’s my turn.
3534	108891	This is the Vaccine that made dosing errors and now has to redo the trial. So why are you rushing this through before the trial takes place
3535	202361	I got my third COVID19 vaccine booster today in honour of the #KarenConvoy This shot goes out to you. #GoHomeTruckers https://t.co/Prj8dY8Hnr
3536	111272	When the virus hit the US, I immediately said “this is gonna be an extinction level event”. At this rate we will catch up to the Black Death in no time. To get a legit vaccine now would mean risking A LOT just for a MAYBE. We have not been prepared and it’s showing.

3544	112253	@BeachGirlJan No vaccine will be cause it’s a digitally created bs virus - Coronavirus is yep the common cold/flu - can not be isolated so everything that comes is nothing but created BS
3545	108130	our government spent billions to create a defense against the CCP biological attack weaponized virus and yet people still won't get the vaccine...guess they just don't love their country enough and they want the communists to win
3546	108070	@profamirattaran This is the serum Switzerland/Germany won't use on older adults. As for desperation, seems the whole world is in dire straits when WHO  has granted the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine an emergency use listing, paving the way for a global rollout.
3547	112912	@TarikCyrilAmar Tarik, I can't imagine how excited the western world, especially in USA will get if COVID19 vaccine made in Russia will be a bad one. They will thrash Russia and Putin inside out. But if their vaccine will be a total success, they will keep silent, omit such news from circulation

3550	110161	@GavinNewsom Wearing a mask is selfish. Common cold is a coronavirus! There is no vaccine for common cold. They've diligently looked for one. Catch a cold. You can catch it again next year. That's why vaccines do not work on coronaviruses. Period. Full stop. Only defense is herd immunity.

3563	108557	@EricTopol We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies. Ask the FDA about it.

3566	110437	@futurepundit This coronavirus is similar to SARS so it may be that developing a vaccine will be similarly challenging. It may be that some of the horrible reactions in Wuhan are similar immune system overreactions and not inherently due to the virus itself. (This is seen in dengue too.)
3567	109330	@szn_holiday It’s almost like we don’t already know a lot about coronavirus strands and have a vaccine for sars🤔
3568	109201	If these folks give us free vaccines as donations,do you think they will allow us to manufacture our own Covid19 generic vaccines  in Africa?

3573	202185	NEW: Ontario is proceeding with second dose administration of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, beginning with those who received their first dose between March 10-19, 20211/2
3574	108501	A vaccine is unlikely. The virus will evolve and mutate.The population needs regular exposure to develop T-Cell immunity.It's beyond control and elimination.Get back to normal. Use vaccines against the worst strains, and target the vulnerable.You know, like flu.#COVID19

3577	111998	The flu pandemic lasted for two yrs and they never found a cure why you think they give you the flu shot. This coronavirus pandemic is gonna last for two yrs they making a vaccine because there is no cure
3578	109649	I’m definitely going to say I got the vaccine if this is true.I’m just being as truthful as they were.#CovidVaccine
3579	109109	*sigh* And here goes the first.(I know it doesn’t mean the end for this vaccine but not looking good).This is why vaccine research usually takes years, and why I don’t keep my hopes up. Failure in vaccine research is part of the process.
3580	112088	#DrFauci has lost my trust. He now tells America, there will be a #Vaccine by the end of the year. On whom will they test this Vaccine, prisoners? Formerly, Fauci said a suitable Vaccine would take between18-24mths to know if it works. Has Dr. Fauci fallen foul of #GOPCorruption?
3581	112429	Will we eventually reach #HerdImmunity when the #antivaxxers either die or create their own antibodies? #CovidVaccine
3582	112904	Yes... if my slippery snow covered sidewalk, that belongs to the city can get me sued if a person is injured... then not much of a stretch for Covid spreading when vaccines are available.
3583	110461	@maestramarney I'm so very sorry for your loss. Because of the Trumptards scientists are starting to say that covid-19 in all four phases is most likely going to be with us forever. I suspect until they find something like the pneumonia vaccine we will probably have to get a shot every year

3587	112489	“I never get sick. I don’t need the vaccine.”1. You can still be asymptomatic and spread #COVID19 to others.2. You can still give the #coronavirus a chance to mutate into a more virulent strain.
3588	108962	And if the vaccine works those who take it will be immune to the virus. No reason to worry about me who doesn’t want to take a vaccine. Right? So there’s no reason to mandate everyone taking it just those who, “want to live”. At least according to THEM!
3589	110401	#bbcbreakfast What do you mean it's not yoghurt?What the hell have I been growing in my fridge if it's not a coronavirus vaccine?
3590	108822	They have coronavirus vaccine but it's for the elite. they'll start threatening us that we can get the vaccine if we agree for the microchip. This is how they're going to control ppl. Dont call doctors dont contact ppl. Stay healthy as long as possible 🖤 #WhyImNotVotingForTrump

3600	112614	This is so great. I'm going to have all my vaccine information tattooed on my body in case I lose my card--but where?
3601	111349	Yeah then they’re gonna tell you the vaccine only makes you immune for 6 months and you need a booster
3602	110996	@andrew_lilico @dumbrill We don't. It can't be done without a vaccine. There isn't one. Yet.That has always been the fundamental flaw in the 'herd immunity' thesis. It was based on plans for a flu pandemic. A coronavirus isn't influenza.
3603	108049	The #CLOTSHOTS aren't vaccines! Please don't just take my word for it! Do the research! Don't take what anyone says at face value..especially the government &amp; particularly not the people that are going to make a lot of money out of what they're telling you to do!!.eg..Big Pharma!
3604	107704	@GandBLawyers The Victorian government are lying about test numbers? The question is why? And the answer is to keep this fraud called covid going until a vaccine arrives. Then most will jump at the vaccine to go back to normal &amp; those who don’t take it will be persecuted.
3605	111840	I am never taking this vaccine for sure. If anyone isn’t providing trial data and publishing them, they can’t be trusted.
3606	202118	I was fine after first two shots of Pfizer #COVID19 vaccine... but the Moderna booster absolutely wrecked me.

3608	108841	@dobermankahn @Tennscarlett1 @Richard63052724 @CanalZone66 @poeticpotion111 If you get the vaccine you are safer than if you didn't take it.But if you think it's smart to get covid-19 to be even safer then you are dumb af. You can die from it and pass it out to others!
3609	110350	Y’all are killing me. So the virus is gonna end by us all collectively staying on lockdown... forever? And not the government using this time to create a vaccine and tests for immunity? America is trying to patent the vaccine before it’s even been made whi-#Day13 #StayHome
3610	112749	I don't want a vaccine!!! That there could or will be a vaccine for #COVID19 is a ruse 4 something all 2gether. Many sticky fingers in the COVID pie! COVID=VIRUS &amp; as such, it's constantly mutating! That's why there's no vaccine for the common cold, which btw, is a COVID virus!

3619	111174	@zanaturalhealth @rcr_pereira @geoffreyyork @MarianneThamm The purpose of not going for ‘herd immunity’ is that there is more time to find a cure. The concept of herd immunity in the absence of a vaccine just means everyone gets sick - it is not a cure. For Covid19 80% need to become infected and then immune. How is that good news?
3620	108848	"Is there data on how long immunity from COVID lasts once a vaccine has been administered? The ""post-vaccine"" hype is getting out in front of what the reality may be."
3621	109461	@NJKMcG @gaelmcl @Aintropy @BorisJohnson So what good with a vaccine do, if it mutates and changes so quickly? And I'm quite sure there is just one strain of COVID-19, hence why all the vaccines are focusing on COVID19. So How can Boris get the virus again if he's already got the white blood cells or t-cell immunity?
3622	109264	You blew flu vaccine. Does that mean you're due to get one right like the blind squirrel finding a chestnut?
3623	107708	I used this exact rubric to figure out whether I should get #COVID19 or not, and it convinced me to get the vaccine. BTW, being vaccinated *can* stop you from getting and spreading #COVID, but just like every other form of medicine, results are not 100% guaranteed.

3632	108852	@CDCgov Natural immunity is good. No one wants to get Covid19 but vaccines aren't stopping break through cases. So if you've already been infected why would you need a vaccine for protection when you already have protection?
3633	112271	Today I had my first dose of #COVID19 vaccine. I got emotional. In one year we rapidly developed and produced millions of vaccines. I fear for what’s next,  being a COVID-accelerated financial crisis or an even deadlier pandemic.

3636	107852	@ifbacongrewont1 @FatEmperor Nope and neither will coronavirus they have been working on trying to find a vaccine for it for years so long in fact that some researchers actually gave up trying...and yet we are expected to believe the vaccine narrative now as well? as for Polio..maybe Bill Gates can chime in.
3637	202014	So it has come - fully vaccinated! Second Pfizer dose today.#COVID19 #vaccinesafetyadvocate #vaccinated #getvaccinatedtoday #bepartofthesolution https://t.co/bc4JKcJ6sg
3638	109554	@MukherjiSudipta @CaptainOctavia @TheSun Well since they haven’t found a vaccine in 70 years of trying for any of the other corona viruses; I seriously doubt they will achieve that in a few months for this one. Also, there’s multiple strains of Covid-19 so it won’t be affective even if they do.
3639	202259	"One Brockton resident wasn’t sure about getting a COVID-19 vaccine at first because of side effects.But once his mother got vaccinated, he soon followed her example.“I was like, ‘If you got it done, I’m going to get it done. What am I scared for?’"" https://t.co/pNOezJ4WHH https://t.co/dKoSqTjncs"
3640	110690	@aaronboggs66 @kyle_boutilier @gina_ault @amyklobuchar So I guess you don't like the idea of a covid-19 vaccine. Don't forget the government is paying for it.
3641	202195	Because of my history of #braininjury from a #TDAP booster in 2018 my Dr recommended that I not be Vaccinated with #CovidVaccine Besides i had covid19 it in 2019!
3642	112260	The IOC flopped on an opportunity to lead a global vaccine campaign with WHO or something. Even with a global vaccine shortage, the IOC has to be corrupt enough to get vaccines for every Olympian headed to Japan
3643	111639	@Oregonian I am all for vaccines as they are proven safe, and often the side effects are little compared to what the vaccine is for. I even get flu shots and stay healthy. As long as a Covid-19 vaccines was properly tested as other vaccines, I would get one.
3644	108784	The only Project Fear is the one against masks, all based on anecdotal evidence like 'an imaginary friend of an imaginary friend had to sit down for a minute after wearing a mask to go and buy cigarettes - that proves Bill Gates is trying to murder us with an untested vaccine'.
3645	109616	If they tried to pay me $3000 I still wouldn’t get it. Idc I don’t need a vaccine for a disease that has a 99.9% survival rate.
3646	110890	The employees that got fired for not taking the COVID vaccine took all the other mandatory vaccines to keep this job. They chose to politicize Covid… and to fundraise on GoFundMe. #COVID19 #antivaxxer
3647	112097	If you will say NO to BJP in Bihar,BJP will say NO to vaccine for Bihar!Ye vote maang rhe hain ya dhamkiyan de rahe hain?
3648	112284	My relatively savvy parents are thoroughly confused about COVID-19 vaccine protocols (they aren't in the eligible groups in their area, but news coverage made them think that they were, without providing guidance on how to sign up when they are eligible).
3649	112174	So you're feeling judged upon about the fact that you are refusing to do what is best for the world as a whole and get a fucking vaccine against a contagious illness that has killed millions?'huh. who'd have thunk
3650	202401	My cousins girlfriends brother got the #covid19 #vaccine and 2 weeks later, boom, he was suddenly a #DallasCowboys fan. Terrible sad news. Think before you get the poke.
3651	108286	@MonoyashaDvC @cheetah_spotty You can use it for humans. It also is an effective treatment for COVID-19 that has been used in countries like India to treat poor folks and even unvaccinated. While the vaccine does not prevent the effects of COVID so...you're really the uninformed one.
3652	109811	@GeoffBell2 @yairlapid @IsraelMFA You really think the Israeli government are giving the vaccines to the Palestinians because they really care THAT much for the Palestinian people? Hardly! They’re doing it because they know how contagious COVID-19 is &amp; it’s just a way they can protect their OWN people.
3653	110410	@dbongino Which is why you see what you see in the media where they’re pumping fear into the coronavirus when what they should be pumping is solutions They don’t do that they don’t ever offer any solutions It’s wear a mask shut up and wait for a vaccine
3654	112350	Question of the day:So, if we come up with a vaccine for Covid-19 what will be the regulations regarding #antivaxxers?If this is as deadly &amp; contagious as they keep saying if a good portion of people do not get vaccinated what good will it do?
3655	108593	@mlord01 @ThrombosisUK There is no reason for those with APS not to have a COVID-19 vaccine &amp; no indication any one is preferable.
3656	202082	So now that I’ve gotten my second jab, do I still have to take Zinc and Vitamin C pills everyday? #covid #covid19 #pandemic #vaccine.
3657	111646	"@BLSplashGayZ so this is the first i've ever heard anything like that. the term ""novel coronavirus"" doesn't say ""50 years of research"" to me.but that's also not what i asked.all im asking why being skeptical about this vaccine makes someone an anti-vaxxer?"

3659	108517	Hm I wonder how long he stood in line.  I feel for the poor souls standing for hours in the cold just to be told there are no vaccines left then this one gets his shot. Ugh.
3660	112512	or.. does it prove the vaccine is worthless.What's the point,  if it doesn't protect you from getting Covid or infecting others?Or, did all these Democrats Lie about getting the vaccine in the first place?
3661	108540	@chrislhayes We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies.
3662	109299	@JamieBaldock4 @hellofacake @BorisJohnson There has never been a successful vaccination for coronavirus in the past, there’s not even one for common cold. It usually takes many years to develop a safe vaccine. And yes, herd immunity is the only way out, that’s why we are all alive. That’s why you have immune system.
3663	111024	Are you going to write an article about everyone who dies after receiving the vaccine? So if I get hit by a bus after I get vaccinated can my family expect my name in your mouth?
3664	108698	BabeYou too belong to the MSM rumour mongering clan.Haven't you heard/read that before the SII vaccine was certified the GoI has contracted for 100+21 million vaccines.After supplying this order GoI too will pay the same rate as others.SO PLEASE GET IT IN YOUR HEAD
3665	110470	what do you think on herd immunity phenomena? do you think it will suit in Indonesia? #HerdImmunity #SARS-CoV-2 #COVID19 #vaccine
3666	110163	Phase 3 is the trial that determines whether or not the vaccine is effective. This is a really stupid idea, especially considering we now have proven cases of reinfection occurring 3-4 months after the first infection.
3667	109990	@mitchellvii The flu has a vaccine. Covid-19 doesn’t (yet). No one is minimizing the flu deaths - people are preparing so the coronavirus isn’t WORSE. We’ll compare numbers after peaks... I honestly hope you’re right. You downplaying it now isn’t helping though.
3668	109824	@ChicalinaT @delterrykilgore I agree there will be a time we need to get back to pre virus life. That time is when everyone can be tested for COVID-19 or there is a vaccine for the virus. That is when life will return to normal.
3669	108613	@simondolan There has never been a successful coronavirus vaccine in history. But, I guess they're like buses- you wait forever for one, and then three come along all at once. LOL. Nothing to see here. 🤔
3670	109786	"@ParisMadson I think it's patently CRUEL to not allow us to get Regeneron or Remdesivir.  This has the ""feel"" of the ""PURGE"" or 'The Thinning.""  #vaccine #COVID19"

3672	109932	@VoidSurf1 @MLevitt_NP2013 It's not a pandemic is it, it's a coronavirus. Get back to me when you find the Wiki page for the vaccine for the common cold.
3673	107902	@MattHancock Any idea when the investigation into the manipulation of PHE Covid19 death figures will be known? Because I think I'll wait for the outcome of the real figures &amp; weigh up the odds of my catching Covid19before I allow a DNA changing vaccine to go in my body if you don't mind.
3674	112151	for the life of me i cannot actually understand why would even feel the government wants best for “us” anyway. the pandemic is something new to us, coronavirus is new to us, the vaccine as well. everything is in such an unfamiliar state as of right now. skepticism should exist.
3675	111373	We all need to work together to protect the world from #COVID19. Will @g20org states please step up and release much needed funds for response efforts to @WHO @CEPIvaccines and @gavi? Together, we can beat this pandemic.
3676	110914	@timspector Forgive me if this is a stupid question, but is there any link between Covid-19 vaccines preventing the onset of hayfever symptoms ? Normally my hayfever kicks in strongly mid-May, but this year I haven’t had any symptoms (yet)
3677	108419	@Mivi_Official I think covid-19 vaccine will arrive first than refund for my order no. 090802698. It's been two months since I have returned the product and continuous follow up for refund but there's no support from customer care. Didn't expect this from MIVI.

3681	109629	Give it to Bill Gates first. In fact give him all the vaccines first. If he don't died, get cancer or a third tail in 5 years maybe then the study will be safe, No?
3682	112158	@sciam Current vaccine is yet to be so stable and the mutations of the virus may possibly make this vaccine useless in coming days..My best guess, this story will end up as seasonal flu vaccine wherein we will have to take covid19 vaccine every 6 months/year.
3683	111712	@AndyBiotech $AZN has never been a vaccine company before now and Oxford University is a... well, an academic institution.Realizing that, chances of producing a safe vaccine that prevents coronavirus infections in all comers anyone?
3684	111033	➡  Multiple SLU faculty will add their expertise to our epidemiology, communications and geospatial work. It will help us research and plan for an eventual COVID-19 vaccine. And it will allow us to use SLU’s COVID-19 app for symptom tracking and contact tracing.
3685	109760	To everyone without a COVID19 vaccine either by choice or not, I sincerely wish you good luck and hope you do not get exposed to this nasty, nasty virus.
3686	112439	So looks like I’ll be participating in the #COVID19 vaccine trial. They just need to clear my odd reaction to the HPV vaccine from 10+ years ago, but once they do I’ll be setting up my first appointment to get microchipped, I mean my first injection.
3687	112307	They can authorize all the emergency Covid vaccines they want you’re not FDS approved you don’t know what you’re putting into your body and if you think it’s safe not me
3688	112944	Somehow we've managed to invent and deploy an entire new vaccine technology in this time but can't figure out which of dozens of existing antivirals will work against a coronavirus.
3689	108753	Truth &amp; facts scare Hehr Fraudci. He's all about helping make deadly viruses &amp; vaccines that don't work. I guess they do work when population control is the objective. 5 yrs. in prison is not enough.
3690	110365	@cachobweeney I think if 25% of the pop. gets immunized by next spring it will be a miracle. All those whining about masks = tyranny now, there is no way in hell they would agree to EVER being injected with a #COVID19 vaccine.You know - the Bill Gates, George Soros, contrails crowd...
3691	112843	@JustinTrudeau What about all the Canadians who are high risk and can’t get the current vaccine because we are on immune suppressant drugs? We are being told we can’t get the current vaccine and we want it #covid19 where do Canadians with compromised immune systems go for funding and a vaccine?
3692	111359	It's proved that HIV is treatable, Ca is a different subject it's not a virus u can't compare a virus to a disease &amp; not all illnesses are fought the same way. Also so what if they came up with a vaccine in this short time interval? Covid is clearly more contagious and urgent atm
3693	109298	Such a sad story. Anyone else feel like you're screwed either way? Take the vaccine and risk whatever adverse effects it has, don't, and risk this?
3694	109145	@VOAChinese What happened? China has announced that novel coronavirus vaccine is available free of charge to all people in China.
3695	108185	"Something I like about the ""don't take vaccine because you don't know long term effects"" folks is that they never mention long term effects of COVID."
3696	110633	When we have a coronavirus vaccine, the federal government will start to give the vaccine to elderly Americans first, then to everyone else, hopefully free.
3697	108787	@JeffVeillette Great except that won't work as I got my Hep A and other vaccines. Not getting the COVID-19 vaccine. It is experimental and no long term data on it.
3698	108794	They still haven’t got a vaccine for SARS (a coronavirus), and that was 18 years ago, now these morons expect us to believe they can conjure up an entirely new sage/tested vaccine, for an entirely new virus within a year. I know you think we’re all thick, but we’re not..
3699	108177	Why aren't the vaccines working to stop the spread? The UK is a highly vaxxed country. They going to try and blame it all on the unvaxxed there too?

3704	108391	Lock it down till atleast 2022..... We're going to do this just wait for a vaccine dance until people finally decide life's to short to not fully live it.
3705	108996	Not even one day. This seems to indicate that parents sent this kid to school while awaiting a test result. This is exactly what teachers and parents fear will happen. This is why schools should remain closed until therapeutics or a vaccine is developed.
3706	108732	@BreitbartLondon PM you say we may never get a Coronavirus vaccine. No surprise, the scientist can't stop the common cold, and we still get flu with the so-called vaccine, so let us get our economy up and running again. We can't keep hiding from a virus. Let the vulnerable and fearful stay safe.
3707	109705	I really don't get this demand for vaccines that don't prevent covid but only lessen symptoms when you contract it. If kids aren't spreading it (see recent Duke study) then this seems like cutting in line. #ncpol
3708	202157	@kmonation I have gotten the covid vaccine about 20 times now. 4 Pfizer, 12 moderna, 4 Johnson. Once I got my first vaccine, I started cravings for it. There is something so great knowing I am reducing the spread of the coronavirus with each of them. I am feeling so empowered.
3709	107838	“Everyone wanted to play again, but it’s still a gamble out there. This story is tragic and it’s not as safe as everyone’s saying out there, even if you’re double-vaxxed.”
3710	110337	I feel like this is gonna confuse people, especially since no one has a choice in what vaccine they receive.
3711	112573	And who would believe such a dictator like Putin? He can't even encourage his people to take the Sputnik vaccine. Just like China, whose orientation is that their country is a utopia and the rest of the world is rubbish.
3712	108160	Is this what we want for our country ?? I think NOT!! This should scare the beekeepers out if anyone considering taking jab. You have been warned 😡
3713	107855	"Trump thinks the virus will spike in places but the governors will ""put out the fires.""  OMG. We're so screwed. He's not interested in a vaccine. He thinks it's going away. #COVID19"
3714	108875	@KTHopkins Wow! I like coincidences! We had the virus outbreak in Wuhan,which has the Wuhan Institute of Virology,they build a hospital in 10 days,who could to die already passed away,they bring the vaccine probably to sell for a good price.
3715	111147	“bring a resident that is patient facing to get the vaccine in your place” and to ask the program director for their “buddy” assignment.” This is just awful. These residents deserve better.

3723	109773	@DearAuntCrabby The coronavirus was first discovered in the 1960s. Why wasnt a vaccine looked into then. Why wait until a pandemic?
3724	109035	Honestly…@GavinNewsom should override this order. People can now get any vaccine they want whenever they want at any pharmacy they want. More masking requirements won’t change their mind and it’s only going to cause more problems for businesses.
3725	110166	The way the IRL govt has handled #COVID19 &amp; #CovidVaccine is really making me regret moving home. They are so bad &amp; seem to believe they know more than the rest of the world. @DonnellyStephen @MichealMartinTD @LeoVaradkar @simoncoveney I don't want to raise my family like this

3734	110274	@arinudman @maskartists @richardursomd The COVID-19 vaccine really isn’t a vaccine in the medical definition of a vaccine. It does not improve your immune response to the infection, nor does not limit you from getting the infection.
3735	108039	@andygoldstein05 So we have a virus in the world that we may NEVER find a vaccine for and will always be around like the common flu, good luck to you staying in lockdown and keeping kids out of school FOREVER! Covid-19 is going nowhere anytime soon........
3736	111894	@mithisa_motho This is not true. Check on WHO website or google you’ll see SARS-CoV has had vaccines for years and covid-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2. I don’t know what you mean there’ve never been vaccine.
3737	112650	This is an appropriate step - a pause - while the data can be evaluated.   Such clots occur regularly in the population, so this MAY or MAY NOT be related to the vaccine.  That is why the investigation and pause is appropriate.

3755	111069	Here’s the Toronto Star trying to push the same globalist agenda. Not happening. Masks come off once the vaccine is readily available. If everyone puts this intent in their mind, it will materialize. Question is how long will humanity let itself get pushed around? When is enough?
3756	110372	Like she 👇🏽 says in the second video , ❤️ will get is through “The Dark Winter” as articulated by the great James Corbett It will get worse before it gets better.  But I agree with her, the Oligarchy will lose.  Because they’re insane and overreached re #COVID19 mass jab fraud.
3757	107928	Stop spreading stupid misinformation about the Covid-19 vaccine. No it’s not deadly, nor will cause any irreversible effects. If you don’t want it, stfu and move along for someone else to get it.
3758	110088	@Avislafin1 @BigBrotherWatch @rld_real_CPR @silkiecarlo If you've had the vaccine, or coronavirus and thus have immunity, why do you need 'reassurance?'
3759	110297	No one wants the vaccine. Only the manufacturers who created &amp; spread the virus &amp; want to make money off ppl suffering want it. No one will take it &amp; if you try to force Americans it won't work..@realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @Scavino45 @TuckerCarlson @scrowder @MarkDice
3760	109181	@combienDUtemps @LonelyChell79 @brentstuder @PeterHotez Right, they have plenty of research done on other coronaviruses, just like boeing has decades worth of research designing planes. It still takes boeing years to design a New plane, just like it would take years to develop a vaccine for a Novel coronavirus.
3761	202093	Yesterday, a meagre 50k doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Colombia, a country with almost 60k COVID-19 deaths. After an overblown ceremony at the airport and a freaking motorcade, vaccine roll-out finally started today. This is how it's being handled. 😩
3762	111199	At this point, I'd prefer to be called an antivaxxer...if being pro vax is to participate in this circus, sorry not sorry.Who takes so many 'vaccine' a year? Since when is that a thing? And if you refuse you are labeled anti science?Get the F out with your new science. Sheep.
3763	112777	@fitterhappierAJ @CharletonOonagh Not one to attack scientists for scientific discussion Coronavirus/all RNA viruses have never elicited much memoryMaybe we can link Tettox like for Pneumococcal/HiB in infants, but twice yearly boosters are the absolute minimum we can hope for.So control is way to go instead
3764	202350	Yesterday I had my first dose of Oxford, AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. I hope everyone who is 18+ will get their COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible.

3767	107944	The current vaccines are not going to protect is from getting or transmitting the virus, they're also not going to prevent unhealthy people from hospitalizations. The effort to force compliance and passports on you has nothing to do with health.. IMO.
3768	111627	Drinking alcohol after getting a coronavirus vaccine can significantly blunt the immune response and potentially render the vaccine ineffective, according to a leading Russian scientist.Dec 11, 2020#vaccine #alcohol #drinking #ineffective
3769	109202	@Underground_RT @cathyraats They did do the first satellite and man in space. Not surprised they are first with a Covid19 vaccine.
3770	111243	@Tony__Heller There are two ways to get herd immunity:  1) get the virus  2) get a vaccineThe last coronavirus vaccine took forever to develop, test, and get into production.And by “forever” I mean it’s never happened.
3771	108727	I am 1 of the 8. I’ve received both vaccines, test twice a week for work and attended many in-person meetings relating to council matters in recent weeks, undertaken safely/professionally by our fantastic council staff. Labour’s unpopular #GreenBinTax is why they don’t want this!
3772	110139	@GovPritzker coronavirus vaccine only work if you don’t have virus it does not work if you already go it or are sick with the virusWear the mask
3773	111036	Just like the Influenza vaccine....doesn't mean you're not going to get the Flu..however, if you do, you won't die!!!
3774	110091	Of course not...he wants to take credit for a vaccine even if it ends up killing us all after the election.
3775	109602	@David_Durkan23 @judetigger @DarranMarshall For crying out loud!  Why do you lot think that people's reason for not wanting the #CoViD19 vaccine is a fear of pain or needles?  Do you think that these people have never had vaccines?  Do you think that they do not go to the dentist?
3776	109286	I think it is best to be realistic. #COVID19 has come and will stay with us. Hopefully, a vaccine has been developed and available in 1 year. It is interesting to think about if we could do the same as in South Korea, mapping every person that has tested positive,&amp; their network.
3777	107850	@WJCork My reason FOR getting the vaccine is for a religious reason. To love my neighbor as myself and being vaccinated with allow me to take the gospel to the nations and not worry about taking COVID-19 too
3778	112893	If you want to get vaxxed do it because you want to!!! I’m not afraid of anyone who’s un vaxxed, they pose ZERO threat to me or anyone else!! #Startlivingagain #COVID19 fear mongering is for show only!!!
3779	109585	@LorienElros @BarackObama @POTUS Sorry he passed. But no vaccine has ever had 100% efficacy. The Covid-19 vaccine has a 78% efficacy and the booster increases that.
3780	111601	@JJWUrology @ecclesias @SummerPMHNP This disaster right now exists Bc a deadly virus has been politicized. There’s a vaccine available to disarm the deadly virus…politicians refuse to speak TRUTH to their constituents.Covid-19 has a cure. It’s a vaccine!Those refusing the vaccine are occupying all the beds!
3781	112478	So they lost the market for their covid-19 vaccines and now they produced new virus so called omicron so that they can sell it's vaccines and overcome the loss they faced. Poor @ASTRAZENECAUK@AngelMutabaruka @imfurayiwacu @IGIHE @AJEnglish
3782	109241	@Boabbysam @timfisher836 Right. And Covid-19 vaccines are effective. There is no truth in advertising. This is opposite-speak.
3783	108234	@Macro__Business @anonymouse476 @Chuckjson @realDonaldTrump Actually you could develop a vaccine for a cold strain but the mutation rate of those viruses would render it useless quickly. So far novel coronavirus doesn't do that so there is hope. The Oxford vaccine looks promising and that is the trial I entered
3784	107786	If this doesn't disturb u then u are lost. The vaccine makers will not accept legal responsibility for harmful side effects &amp; since NGO's can't afford to, these people cant get a vaccine.But 'this is about health. The vaccines are safe.' Oh &amp; my favorite -'the vaccines are free'
3785	111002	Really cool that the US can fast-track development of a vaccine for coronavirus, but...  You're not going to get the coronavirus vaccine.  Why?  Half of Americans don't bother getting a flu shot in any given year.
3786	108579	"Why did Bill Gates quit Microsoft? Obviously to focus on his evil world domination strategy b/c the ""Coronavirus"" is the exact opportunity he needed to swoop in with his ""vaccine"""
3787	110271	@__LIARS_EXPOSED @PeterMy61496556 @ephenas @StopTCensorship Please explain how the mrna vaccines such as the Pfizer covid19 vaccine works? What exactly is the mechanism that they use to stimulate the immune system to develop antibodies to the virus? If you don't have a clue then do some basic research
3788	111718	If there has to be incentives in order to try to get the American people to get the vaccine, then (in my opinion) it is not nor ever has been a serious threat!!!!!!
3789	110198	I wonder if the anti-vaccine crowd is throwing coronavirus exposure parties like they do with measles or things...whatever doesn't kill you I guess...
3790	111701	I know a few of my pals aren’t certain about the vaccine but pls read this thread!I know @GeorgeMonbiot isn’t an epidemiologist or immunologist but he speaks so much sense (cus guess what guys, he listens to scientists!)
3791	112838	I will not enter a restaurant or store that doesn't screen for covid-19 vaccine  . There is nothing in a store worth my life or requiring an organ transplant.

3794	111253	Got my NHS letter inviting me to book my coronavirus vaccine today. I had my vaccine on Monday. That’s all.
3795	109567	Just 3 weeks into the study.  We’ll see if it’s vaccine related but it’s a good reminder that there’s a reason why vaccine development takes time
3796	108633	New vaccine but don't burn you mask yet. Looks like Matt and Johnson may want you to keep wearing it.So they presumably will want to keep the full array of lockown meaures.
3797	111568	"""I would expect it to be as mandatory as you could possibly make it,""That means he already knows he can't legally force anti-vaccinators to take the vaccine unless if they get Centrelink payments and cancel those  payments if they don't!"
3798	109525	How the hell can anyone know if their symptoms would have been worse had they not been vaccinated? They’re still pushing for vaccines even though they got Covid after being vaccinated and boosted
3799	111456	@TheChuck1nator @Smilan317 @GovMurphy @B52Malmet I don't understand WHY you people that were JABBED think  it's okay not to wear mask or social distance just because CDC said so? Don't they also say the jab doesn't protect you from NOT getting Covid19 or variants of it or spreading it? It's just for supposedly less severe?
3800	109057	@TheFreePeopleA1 @DHSCgovuk Our news site tracks the progress of the vaccine for COVID-19 spanning all nations, it's prbly the case Americans will get access to the vaccine. The more interesting ques. remains precisely how effective it ends up being.
3801	112196	Y’all need to quit being bitches and get vaccinated. The vaccine is a product of years of research about coronavirus strains that existed before Covid-19. If they were going to push out an unsafe vaccine it would have come out a year ago when the pandemic just started.
3802	108523	This is a reminder that these shots are not actually vaccines. They don't prevent spread, they don't stop you from getting Covid. All they do is mitigate symptoms for a limited time. That's not a vaccine, that's a treatment.
3803	108608	This applies no matter what country you're in, but especially the US and UK. We know a vaccine is coming now, but it will be months before that starts having a effect and we all still have a part to play until then. We've come this far and need to keep going. #WearAMask

This will change how the country behaves for years to come and may well mean the way we travel and work changes.

3808	112205	@SkyNews It’s mutating again. The vaccine is absolutely useless, that’s why there has never been a vaccine for any of the other coronavirus’
3809	111311	@CuomoPrimeTime @donlemonChris, until everyone who wants a covid-19 vaccine can get, it would not be fair to give preferential access to those who can get it. It would be double discrimination and it would only incetivize the well connected to skip the line even more.
3810	112336	@RichLowry Liked your op-ed on the virus. Coronavirus is not red or blue. But your point that DeSantis has always said vaccines are the best defense against it somewhat undercuts your position - if so, why not mandate them? Just sayin' - keep up the good work. Thanks.
3811	109928	@NBCNews #COVID19 does not care about religion.  If any person will not #WearAMask then they should just stay home. Not wearing one is harming millions of people &amp; 1000s have died so I don't feel sorry for anyone who refuses the vaccine or who refuses to wear a mask for ANY reason!
3812	108820	@DrOz I think the president is wrong. This is not like the flu. We have vaccines for that. We need to stay home until we have a vaccine for COVID-19
3813	111198	Why is there no pressure to find a coronavirus cure only the vaccine? Because there are more healthy people in the world who will take the vaccine. Someone needs to make money on it. You do the maths.
3814	110417	If i gotta drive through and get a weekly vaccine i would just beep my microchip and let me know where to show up.

3824	108678	Does having the coronavirus make you immune? If it doesn't, then the lockdown was a complete waste of time, energy, money, and our economy.If it does, then until a vaccine is proven, getting the disease is the only way to get immunity.#endthelockdown #OpenAmericaNOW
3825	108379	Does anyone wonder why 20-25% of the healthcare workers at a hospital would rather quit than get the vaccine?  Are they all stupid “Trumpists” who don’t “believe the science”?

3828	111314	Hello Pak Govt - GB Govt!? Imposing lockdown isn’t to protect us till vaccine is developed but rather to ensure the transmissibility of virus by infected person remains &lt;1. Once achieved lockdown restrictions are eased stepwise with SOPs in place to maintain that level!
3829	112277	@FourFourJordan No matter what we do, human stupidity will ensure that COVID-19 won't go away just like that. A vaccine is needed.

3832	111915	It’s too early to say for sure, but there are now reasons to suspect that vaccines will not be effective against the South African variant of coronavirus.
3833	108919	This isn't how vaccine trials work.There is not a process by which they purposefully infect test subjects with a live virus.They only need to test that the body is producing antibodies without side effects.
3834	112576	Next Pick $OCGN Deadly variant. Ocugen has the only vaccine grown from live virus. People will be more inclined to get this vaccine. Stock is going to $700

3840	108243	The fact that they paused it for a less than one in a million chance of treatable blood clots should really drive home just how careful they've been and how safe the vaccines are. Please get yours. If not for your own health then for everyone around you who may be vulnerable 💙
3841	110554	@TheRickHoweShow I'm kind of on the fence about the vaccine for covid-19 all as I'm wondering is how long does your immunity last after having the vaccine injected into your body is it 6 months is it a year like the flu shot

3876	107910	While I don't fully trust the #vaccine , or the government, or Big Pharma, or my coworkers, or guests/clients, I'm #fullyvaxxed because the odds are in my favor. I #WearAMask around people because I have NO DESIRE TO GET SICK. What are your thoughts?#COVID19 #pandemic
3877	109033	@joncoopertweets I'll say it again...Time is running out. Get a COVID-19 vaccine or take a life-threatening risk that you may truly regret.
3878	109893	I’m in no way blaming anyone for getting vaxxed. That is a personal decision and choice. This is my story. The person got vaxxed and it shed to child getting us sick. That’s how it happens just letting you know now I had natural Covid19 twice. I’m not getting vaxxed. #takenoshit
3879	112607	We Have Never Made a Vaccine Against Any Coronavirus in History... CNBC Expert Not A Single One.... Quarantine is the Only Method. China Knew That. They Shut It Down Completely, No One In Or Out. Close the Stores. Full Lockdown. #Coronavirus #Quarantine #CNBC #China #Trump
3880	110671	More and more this makes sense. Mask mandates and strong lockdowns are not having the desired effects. Vaccines are. I'm planning on my annual flu shot either Sept or Oct too. It's time to get out of reactionary pandemic thinking. Get vaccinated. Period. And live. Or whatever.
3881	111423	@KendraElyse_ @sunflowercxty @CahillKellie CAUTIOUS is a thing as well. how’s there a vaccine for COVID-19 in 8 months when they couldn’t find a STABLE vaccine or cure for cancer or HIV/AIDS ?? they only have treatments for those in YRS! ppl express choice over masks, which is STATE MANDATED ... we can choose here too!
3882	109078	@CBSNews You have got to stop calling the Covid-19 shot a vaccine. It isn’t a vaccine. Fact! If you can acquire this virus 🦠 multiple times after you received the Covid-shot, take a guess folks. It’s not a vaccine. The correct terminology is COVID-SHOT. Misleading the human race!
3883	202347	Practically admitted by @CMO_England tonight...Well known by those that have had the vaccine already and still got ill.
3884	112238	@BradleyCarlvin1 They say it takes some days for it to work... Secondly they don't check people they vaccinate, in my assumption people get covid-19 jabs when they're sick already
3885	111145	@debbiekadams @kyrstensinema Evidence tends to show that herd immunity to this virus is not possible. A vaccine is also questionable. Coronaviruses are notorious for mutating and so far there has never been a successful vaccine developed for any coronavirus. Good luck!
3886	109521	@PnarBradford @Capt_Kremin @SkyNews That is clearly a stupid criteria and you avoided my question. Out of interest to you though, they started on the generic coronavirus vaccine research around 10 years ago.
3887	110449	Am I correct on this assumption..... after getting vaccinated you can still get Covid-19 however you will be asymptomatic? The vaccine does not keep you from contracting the virus?You can be positive for Covid and also spread it unknowingly because you’re asymptomatic?
3888	110942	So Merkel wants her people to get it but she won’t take it... hmm. Wonder why? #covidvaccineisgenocide
3889	107898	@Abhishe80746659 @Swamy39 @theicai @PMOIndia @atulguptagst @caamresh @anubha1812 #2 If you are so much scared about yourself and your family, please don't come. Get the vaccine, if it comes, and then only give the exam. Unfortunately, If student who is giving exam or someone in his family gets coronavirus, they'll be solely responsible for themselves.
3890	110762	@BrianKempGA You should’ve told Trump to give up this wild goose chase. He should put the energy he’s using to find fraud and put it in planning how to distribute the coronavirus vaccines that are coming out. At least he will go out on a positive note.
3891	108482	"This covid-19 is a farse! Trump has done very little because he and Bill Gates have a plan to label the virus so far out of hand that EVERYBODY has to take that ""Death"" vaccine. This is an attack on Americans. Just shut down thw USA for 1 month! Find a program to feed folk only."
3892	110504	@AlboMP 1) Our kids are statistically unaffected by Coronavirus…2) The “Vaccine” was developed 2 years ago and does little, if anything to affect outcomes in relation to the current strain…3)  Politicians who advocate for freedoms get my vote… not for pointless vaccines…
3893	109647	@notmytruename @grahamjf @CryanGrim @Akustronique @DrEliDavid 2) Polio's behaviour is not even comparable to a corona-virus. Due to high genetic drift, you will a lot of mutations. This will render you vaccine way less effective after half a year or a year. Same as influenza. Other coronavirus' like SARS (IFR 11%) and MERS (IFR 35%)..
3894	108336	If you want to protect the @NHSuk, don’t get a booster near Xmas.They will be on skeleton staff over the festive period. You don’t want to swamp them.@sajidjavid @AmandaPritchard
3895	107979	FG not NAFDAC has met WHO’s conditions for local vaccine manufacturing especially COVID-19 and malaria vaccines . So govt has 49% and the rest is for private sector. Jobs will be created in this sector soon
3896	108477	With what's happening with the #coronavirus, and the suspicion that it's an accidental leak of a vaccine virus from a BSL-4 laboratory in Wuhan, we need an impartial governing body to oversee all hazardous research matters in all countries. #nCoV2019 #wuhanconoravirus
3897	110147	Even if you don’t want the vaccine, that’s fine. Don’t take it. This vaccine will shut the mouths of ALL Governors. It gives them no right or way to shut down and hurt their people. Celebrate this fact even if you will never touch the vaccine. #COVID19 #Thegreatawakening
3898	109278	Everybody get caught up in Trumps spin-offs. How can we send kids to schools when there is no vaccine or medicines for #coronavirus which has already killed over 130,000 people in America. The conversation is laughable. Trump needs to answer for Putin paying 4hits on our soldiers
3899	202282	Augmented Reality. Vs. Reality Coontinuuity. Time to wait until I receive my coronavirus jab in my left arm.
3900	112821	My family and I got vaccinated not just to protect ourselves — but to protect the rest of our family, friends, and vulnerable members of our community.The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, free, and will protect you from getting seriously ill. Please, get vaccinated.
3901	109688	Covid-19 vaccines helped you not get the Covid-19 FLU for 6 to 9 months when we were told it would keep us from getting  Covid-19. Now, a booster it needed.
3902	108823	@PunjabGovtIndia #coronavirus It seems sm people become immune to Coronavirus as they started taking morning &amp; evening walks without masks, elderly taking kids to play out, no social distancing.Isn't it too soon to give up masks and social distancing measures.@kbssidhu1961 @capt_amarinder
3903	111099	Why are you using a bird costume to spread a vaccine rhetoric? This is pathetic. I can’t wait till you end up in a KFC bucket you foolish bird
3904	108488	@bkblk @melodramax_ @EricFielding @GEMI__NI This case is different, since they already have vaccines for other types of coronavirus to work with. As well, basically every vaccine lab globally is working on it. So, yeah, it’ll be much faster to develop a vaccine for covid19
3905	110135	Meanwhile, in the UK doctors get kick back for every Rona vaccine, but only after the second dose.  This is where America would be, and maybe heading, if we don't #StopTheSteal
3906	109200	"Let me get this right, China has the audacity to boast itself being the so called ""fore-front of the world"" in obtaining a vaccine for the devastating coronavirus that they created. Interesting dilemma 🤔 indeed."
3907	110536	Isn’t it funny how I’m a TEACHER and I’m barley being offered the vaccine. I’ve been going to in person class for MONTHS. There have been positive cases at my school and I’m just exposed. I have never tested positive and I just think it’s because I’ve been LUCKY.
3908	109067	@alizaeteri The only person whose brain doesn't receive enough oxygen is you... Conspiracy theorists like u are the reason the world is miserable.Do not take the vaccine if u don't want to.. if u think COVID-19 is fake, kindly visit patients in the ICU, take off your masks and hug them.😊
3909	108789	I’ll never understand how AB is still in the league. Falsifying a vaccine card is a federal crime!!! How many times is AB going to do something illegal and get another chance?
3910	109173	I’m worried, this is what will eventually happen, that people will start walk-ins to the vaccine centres since #cowinregistration isn’t helping much. Please actively manage the expectations sirs @CMofKarnataka @mla_sudhakar #coronavirus
3911	110245	So… people won’t take a free vaccine cos they don’t trust medical expertise, and don’t know what’s in it.But they will pay money for deworming goop meant for large livestock, without knowing what’s in it, and then trust medical expertise to save them when they OD…??
3912	111290	@DoHSocial @SEHAHealth any danger of someone letting me know if I’ve had the vaccine or placebo as a volunteer in the #COVID19 trials? I was told 2 weeks ago that the results are being released........ still nothing.... I just want to know if I’m protected or not #4Humanity
3913	108260	Why are some vaccines getting more negative press than others? Pretty sure they’re all equally untested and bad for us. Is it to give the appearance that the ones they don’t criticise are safe? 🤔
3914	108216	Whoa....I’m so sad my family have and will get the vaccine. I warned them. I asked them not to. I had to let it go.
3915	110615	Don't get vaxxed, get the Rona, build natural immunity.Get vaxxed, 1,2,3, + times, still able to get the Rona, pass the Rona and then still have all the undetermined health issues with the 💉 that's injuring, maiming and killing ppl.I'll take natural immunity for $500 please.
3916	108170	What are they waiting for? It is the elephant in the room! Patents should be globally shared but of course, this is against the corporate business interests. #CovidVaccine #vaccine #COVID19India
3917	111361	@BrianLehrer @nytimes @carlzimmer @WNYC If the pandemic gets sufficiently bad, might we start using a vaccine that had proven to be safe, but not necessarily effective?
3918	112230	@MatthewJshow @JoeBiden Of course there is. WHO literally admitted that the PCR tests are creating false positives so how are they so confident in a vaccine that they don’t even know will stop coronavirus from spreading? As of recent, they have only been testing the vaccine to see if it has any side ...
3919	108089	@TimetoactOne @Trumptweets2020 FACT - Covid-19 is in the human pop. 4 good, fast or slowFACT - mask wearing only slows it down; it can't stop itFACT - herd immunity doesn't mean that no one will ever catch it again, it just reduces the likelihoodFACT - there has NEVER been a vaccine for a coronavirus. EVER.
3920	110446	@RoyCooperNC Healthcare and worker rights are on the ballot don’t mistake this SCOTUS appt anything other than a trump get out of jail free card and no relief to coronavirus. If this WH can’t distribute PPE federally, how will they handle a vaccine?
3921	112376	@RealJamesWoods One doctor said there will never be a true Covid-19 vaccine because this virus is mutating in unprecedented ways.
3922	202307	I'm concerned that the covid19 vaccine is going to be obtrusively collecting data on me without my permission and uploading it all to a cloud server owned by an unknown 3rd party who will use my data against me.- sent from my smart phone.
3923	108277	@tom_nevin It is a complete gamble to plan a pandemic response the worlds first coronavirus vaccine being available in a year. Although it looks good and is a major (amazing) development, there are still some long term unknowns.

3925	110777	girl italy has been fucked up since the first wave of corona virus last year. do you think that they would be still dealing with covid if they had vaccines to donate? 😭 read the room.
3926	112519	In fairness; if Tories had cracked testing and PPE, then had a separate team focusing on drugs and vaccines I would get that. The chaotic way they’ve approached this is pure mismanagement and incompetence. Listening to Trump (?? bleach) is a clear symptom of this #JohnsonMustGo
3927	111263	@JimRHoughton @DrAmberKhan Eradication?   It's a virus that is going to be in the community forever.No previous coronavirus (SARS/MERS/Common Cold) has ever had a successful vaccine.... ever!   There's not only no guarantee for this one, it's very unlikely that it will happen.(cont..)
3928	202440	I got my #COVID19Vaccine!  The 1-dose Janssen vaccine.  Kicked my butt between 18-28 hours after getting it, with soreness, fever, and lots of sleep, but cleared-up real quick.  #COVID19 #vaccination
3929	111553	@MaddowBlog No matter what we do to curb the novel coronavirus—whether through social distancing, wearing masks, or developing a vaccine—one thing is certain: This virus is never going away.
3930	112319	Can't get vaccinated yet, still broke until I can apply for the Cares Act &amp; get money for us next month but we need these vaccines, everyone does.
3931	108535	This idea that we are ever going to “contain” COVID-19 without a vaccine is fanciful. The only way to truly contain this virus without a vaccine is to keep everyone quarantined in their homes indefinitely which we all know is not realistic and has its own disastrous pitfalls.
3932	108046	My Coronavirus Vaccine Predictions:1. Trump will not directly mandate the vaccine, but won't stop it either.2. Mandates will come at state level. If you're in CA or NY, get out now! All states will jump on the bandwagon eventually.More&gt;
3933	109570	@john606sc @Waccoe1919 No one is shouting, John. It isn’t certain that people could catch COVID-19 if they don’t have a vaccine, that is utterly ridiculous to suggest such a thing. I think you need to structure your sentences in an order where people don’t have to decipher what you are saying 😂😂
3934	109207	@Diggab68 @G1auber @petemuntean @Acosta Can't believe you guys are actually worried that you won't get your jab for the common coronavirus...smh. You people really think this is a pandemic, huh?
3935	111994	@denisecockerel @Inevitable_ET @cjones4334 @inevitable #denisecockerel As far as the coronavirus, I don't see how you can sue anyone. If you decide to voluntarily get a vaccine, whether it promises antibodies against coronavirus or not. It's not an injury. The 'injury' has already done by the CCP labs. The world is trying.
3936	107697	@KatieM12121 Father and both Uncles had clots, one Uncle died.I have had Covd19 so cannot carry it or pass it on and have lifelong immunity.Why would I get the vaccine?
3937	108239	This is great news for us all. Please do get vaccinated the soonest as it is available in your locality. Our vaccines work and they offer protection against severe COVID-19, especially now that the variants are on the rise, the benefits will always outweigh the risks. 🙏😷💉💯‼️
3938	108293	I don't buy into all this Q-Anon level of stuff about this virus... If vaxes work and masks work, I believe that's up to that person to do the right thing.  If they don't or they don't work then obviously everyone should be tested.  Even the vaccinated.#COVID19 #VaccineMandate
3939	110347	"That's exactly how I feel about this ""mad dash to the finish line"" vaccine they want to inject. As a doctor told me years ago, ""Medicines are great, but each one is technically a poison since it's not produced by your body's immune system."" Gotta be careful"

3942	107896	I hope that Mike Pence getting the coronavirus vaccine will assuage MAGA opinion, but I think that he, along with every other trump “herd immunity” enthusiast, doesn’t deserve it #Republicans #COVID19
3943	108108	4 months?  For less than 1/3 of the population?  People are never going to do what they need to do to slow this. Maybe that's all the vaccine we'll need since our population will be greatly reduced and nearly everyone who isn't dead will have already had COVID.
3944	109776	92 people made blind from this vaccineIf only they opened their eyes to what is really going in before they sold their souls 👀
3945	111309	“Rich nations can blanket their citizens with COVID-19 vaccines, but they’ll still be vulnerable as long as the coronavirus is spreading in other places where a lack of vaccine has kept immunization rates low.Especially true where HIV infections are common but often undetected.”
3946	112642	@DanPaulman @EssexPR Again, my mother gets the flu jab to protect HERSELF, not you, not I but HERSELF, thus the people who don't take the flu jab pose zero risk to her right?What makes Covid any different? It's a coronavirus is it not? You're spouting collectivism.
3947	112203	The only way this won't occur is if the virus magically disappears and there is no second or third waves.  Will there be safe vaccine for this?  Well there has never been a safe vaccine for a coronavirus.
3948	112597	The covid-19 is from outside,now! will also the vaccine comes from outside? There is something fishy there,if the locals would participate in purging the pandemic by producing the vaccine may be it would be defeated.

3950	112555	The media sport of harping about which countries are winners or losers in fighting coronavirus is ridiculous. Unless we get vaccine tomorrow, this pandemic will continue for 1-2+ years. The countries that are doing bad now may come out the same or even better in the long run.

3966	107953	Until there's a vaccine for COVID19 I'm only leaving my house to pick up supplies. With fools out there gathering in groups to only spread the virus further it makes it harder to have confidence to go back out into public. I'm retired thank God. Tough call 4 workers. Respect.
3967	109442	How does one determine who is a 'private citizen'? Does this mean healthcare workers who work in pvt wouldn't qualify for a free vaccine? Of course MPs and govt officials won't have to pay - seems a little like double standards to me...
3968	202321	Through 2/22, approximately 11.8% of North Carolinians have received their 1st Dose of COVID-19 vaccine, and 6.7% have received their 2nd Dose. Approximately 2.7% of NC is vaccinated (2+ weeks since receiving final dose).

3970	112126	If we treat COVID-19 like the flu it will be catastrophic. There is no vaccine, no one is immune (that we know of), it's more infectious &amp; has a morality rate that could be 30x higher. We have to limit exposure, it's the only prevention measure we have.
3971	110677	@candies2639 A pill to treat Covid19 is not like a vaccine to annihilate it. Get vaccinated to avoid the pill. Please.
3972	112163	Can we talk about how AWFUL I felt after my first #COVID19Vaccine dose? Chills, fever, headache, nausea, fatigue, muscle aches. Major flashbacks to having COVID-19 last year and had to have my fiancé walk the dog because I couldn’t bear the thought of having to go outside.
3973	112833	@journalsentinel Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
3974	112399	@TidyTops @godlessdivabich @starboard_light Duh the Covid-19 vaccines are not 100% effective,  and they have not been promoted as such. They will keep you from getting a SEVERE CASE if infected.
3975	111268	@uMarhobane With or without a vaccine? We never became immune to e.g. smallpox until there was a vaccine.Once we get a vaccine for covid19 I expect we'll put a lid on it; but until then if it runs unchecked I can see it going for a long time, becoming endemic.
3976	202314	Delighted that my wife, a healthcare worker, just received her #COVID19 vaccine. However, she’s acting very strangely now and won’t stop talking about the benefits of Microsoft Azure  🙃

3983	110747	Why only 40+, why isn't the AZ being used to protect all people in hotspots? There's a million vaccines in the freezer right now, and even if they were all AZ (which they're not), they should be moved to wherever they're most needed in Ontario.
3984	108644	My employer has explicitly stated, in both verbal and written form that getting the vaccine would be grounds for dismissal. I value my job, I get to do whatever I want and its paying me more than the guberment and the world economic forum combined.
3985	109444	If anyone has immunity - it’s health care providers and no one should be forced to get the jab and belittled because they don’t. Just my opinion.
3986	109573	@AldrinSampear #bth #vaccine I have my own believe that the covid19 vaccine has been developed  long time together with the virus same as the virus testing kit ,first proof is no country was requested and yet prohibited to manifacture the vaccine. this was a succesful PLANdemic
3987	112818	This person in this picture had COVID-19 the one thing I will say is don’t mess with this virus it does mean business take my word if you are not vaccinated please get your vaccine because I think my vaccine help me get through it it could’ve been worse for me
3988	111013	Which do you think will make you more renowned?  1. Discovering the cure to Coronavirus or  2. Finding the vaccine for it?
3989	108394	@Jman1900Jul @BenRothenberg Great math. Since #vaccine is avaliable world wide, did it or did it not reduce severe #COVID19 and mortality? As I saw working in #Hospitals, and as far you can read in any #relevant news it DID. Nobody said you wont get sick, but you wont end in hospital or die! #FactsMatter
3990	110149	I really think I have the coronavirus I need to get tested. And even if I have it, what happens? There is no vaccine lol
3991	109763	We in the United States-- unlike in say China-- are SO FORTUNATE that we have people like #PresidentTrump, #JaredKushner, dear #Ivanka, #MitchMcConnell in charge when a #COVID19 vaccine is found, becoz they will bust ass to make certain everyone is able to get it.FOR FREEEEE.
3992	112899	SA’s cabinet and it’s ministers is a big fat joke. When covid-19 hit Italy and other developed countries they said they were ready for it but now they are busy pushing an untested vaccine for us humans what a great country we have.
3993	109021	Would you take any of the COVID-19 vaccines if you had  opportunity?If yes, why? If no, why?Share with me your thoughts.
3994	112609	@eddiemiller9000 @D1Bluebird @lewis_goodall I don’t think you’d need to do extra testing to have a good idea of that, if the new variant has the same spike protein as the old ones (which all variants of COVID-19 seem to have) then the vaccine would lead to the same outcome as it would trigger the same immune response
3995	201955	@musicisarainbow Just be prepared to feel cruddy after the 2nd dose. I need to get a Tetanus shot as well. I'm Trying to get it all done before the Covid-19 vaccine. Did you do a flu shot? I got mine in September.
3996	108470	@Beka49707658 @PPutricide @R_H_Ebright You’re comparing apples to oranges. Firstly, yes, get the vaccine. Secondly, Fauci donates $ to Wuhan lab that admitted they did, indeed, use that $ for gain of function with the novel coronavirus. Not good.
3997	109787	It takes years to develop a vaccine. They've never developed one for common colds &amp; flu in decades but they've got one within months of #COVID1984 ?Those 2 million will be the lucky ones.
3998	109514	"Laurie, 1) You are awesome2) Are there any studies on the vaccines in regards to preventing COVID damage to cells that cause stroke, heart attack, etc.? We obviously don't know ""long term"" damage COVID will have. But will COVID create ""preexisting conditions""?"
3999	108137	I am NOT an anti-vaxxer but I have no plans to get the coronavirus vaccine soon. I don't trust big pharma ( always out to make money at any cost) and I sure as hell don't trust Trump with my life. I'll wait a few months and wear a nice safe mask.
4000	109604	@JanVanMulders3 @TheBioTrader Dude it’s the only stock under $1 with a coronavirus vaccine in the works, all other popped, this is a no brainer man
4001	108337	Moderna vaccine, or any of the mRNA platform based vaccines, produce immunity that last only three months. So, I can’t continue vaccinating myself every quarter (I.e.reprogramming my cells to produce coronavirus like spike proteins).Whatever happened to AstraZeneca vaccine!
4002	109344	...van den Bossche, and other renowned and recognized virologists are saying.  And a) There has never been a successful leaky vaccine, not against coronavirus nor any other virus, that has ended a pandemic or wiped out a disease.  b) All coronaviruses ever tried...
4003	111714	@JeremyVineOn5 Yes it is. My son got covid19 in school from his teacher then we all got it in November my partner still has no taste &amp; smell I'm still suffering with a cough.Teacher's should be getting the vaccine they too are front line worker's.
4004	201956	@RepSwalwell I can’t sleep for long period I feel tired. I can't imagine getting worse with another dose of COVID-19 MANDATORY vaccine! My Asthma has been mild to acute; mild to acute allergies &amp; this has been my reaction (although it was delayed and not immediate) to the Pfizer Covid vaxs.
4005	202168	"@DohenyDarren @harrymcgee @IrishTimes But that still doesn't make the sentence ""Almost 25% of population has received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine"" right."
4006	108775	I fear this is just the beginning of the outrages in how the vaccine is going to be rolled out in this country. Thinking of pressure that truly heroic state public health officials trying to operate in our brutally unequal and unjust system will be under.
4007	108363	@Channel4News “scientist” claiming Covid19 herd immunity should be the strategy, when most scientists know that is only possible with vaccine. If you don’t like lockdowns etc, then *eliminate* the virus. That has proven to work in China, SK, HK, NZ...
4008	110602	@Martinhood15 @boyscout123456 @ECUProfessor Not only that but Covid19 is fairly new to ad where as the flu has been around for ages AND there are vaccines. We can’t compare this to the regular flu yet.
4009	112311	Think again please and do more research. Gate vaccine is poison and evil. Bad ingredients and secret ingredients. This is a bad idea.
4010	109879	You know, when I called this back in Feb I was half joking. I don't mind being a little carful about any new vaccine coming out. It's rushed so there could be issues IF we even get one. But why go out into the streets in large numbers to protest a thing we don't even have yet?
4011	109708	Just to state what many don't realize: there is no COVID-19 vaccine. There is a medical treatment, but it does not give you COVID-19 immunity (which is what a vaccine does). This is the single biggest medical experiment on live subjects in human history, but it is not a vaccine.
4012	110064	@MzAllieOsin1 If the vaccine doesn't prevent you from Covid-19 illness, just as the flu shot doesn't prevent everyone from getting flu, what the fk are you saying. For fk sake their in the cab of a truck, not going to concerts and clubs.
4013	111735	@James09302000 @AntonioSabatoJr How many vaccines have been made and were successful in treating any coronavirus in the past 100 years? Zero. What makes anyone believe that all of a sudden they can whip one up this time in a few short months? Don't be dumb.
4014	108791	It certainly is getting worrisome here out West. My thoughts always go to frontline HCPs and my old ER buddies. Stay safe. Stay strong #COVID19BC. Vaccines can’t come fast enough!
4015	111720	@stephenpollard My surgery said that the vaccines they're using now were ordered last year using estimated figures. Covid-19 has thrown a big spanner in the works. I had mine as an over 65 y/o today, we're the last batch. More vaccine is expected in November. They're doing their best.
4016	111277	Underlying the Government's assumptions is that a coronavirus vaccine won't be in place until late next year at the earliest. It expects Australians will have to live with social-distancing until a vaccine is fully rolled out. #auspol  😭😩
4017	109842	Jab me up and get me to craven park @hullkrofficial couldnt care less if bill gates wants to watch aswell
4018	202354	@CV_UHB Many thanks to everyone involved in the Covid-19 Booster jab roll-out. I had mine completed today &amp; my gratitude goes out to you all. 👍👍
4019	202190	@JKJAVMY @Khairykj Dear, I have taken my 1st dose AZ vaccine during 1st batch on 7th May, if I can get my 2nd dose AZ within 8-12 weeks in Germany (also AZ vaccine) hospital, will you recognize me as complete full vaccination, issue covid-19 digital certificate (in MySejahtera)??
4020	112240	@LilUziBert99 @CallMeDave97 If you eat filet o fish don’t worry about what’s in the coronavirus vaccine
4021	107792	Just because you had covid last year doesn’t mean you don’t need the vaccine. The Delta variant is not to be trifled with. Get the shot 👇👇
4022	109713	I'm polling folks I know from different backgrounds about their views on the Coronavirus vaccines, how important it is for them and if they will take it.Results in the thread below. Will keep adding responses through the day along with profile of person (w/o personal details)
4023	110388	@LoneSucculant @crowngaurav Idiot! 😡There is covid's vaccine in Dubai? Well, i don't think so. I'm trying to say Brazil have a lot of people who don't care about coronavirus too and don't protect they selves
4024	202213	This is why I’ve decided to get my second dose and eventually a booster despite having had it July 2020 (and first vax May 2021). I’d rather be safe and I no longer buy the “you’ve had it so don’t need to get double jabbed.”
4025	111704	@scotconant @Timcast What is there to understand ? 1) The vaccine is not a vaccine, but a gene therapy injection. 2) kids are practically IMMUNE to covid19 3) if old people are scared, they can get VACCINATED to be protected. 4) Vaccines are experimental ! Wake up, will you ?
4026	108605	@collette_books @michaelvkim So a vaccine like the flu vaccine that is only for strains that came out one to two years prior, yet the virus will mutate on a regular basis?  So does this mean we are going to have to get a new coronavirus vaccine every year, for the strain from the year prior?
4027	111629	Good info on Idaho's vaccine distribution plan. I'm glad to take last place in line in order for these folks to get the vaccine first.
4028	112688	this dude sounds like an idiot. he does realize the vaccine has been in production for a minute this isn't the first coronavirus we've seen.
4029	112673	I feel so privileged to have received my first vaccine today 🙂 so I will be twinning my vaccine and supporting @UNICEF_uk in their campaign to ensure everyone has a fair chance of being protected from Covid-19 😷 #GiveTheWorldAShot
4030	108007	People who never get sick because they have a robust immune system take vaccines under coercion, which by definition pisses about with the immune system, suddenly have problems with their immune system. How is this whole vaccine thing even a debate?
4031	109883	@MagpieGazzT @Carla_littlerob @GOVUK Coronavirus’ are generally common colds - incredibly easily spread but very mild so we don’t need a vaccine to protect us.The issue with this coronavirus therefore is it is highly contagious BUT now deadly too .... &amp; we don’t have any population vaccine protection!
4032	110600	And what?? There’s tones of variations of the flu but you just take your yearly jab and get on with it, I get why this is important but it’s put across in a way that feels like pure fear mongering
4033	110668	This is infuriating. Also seems self-owning for anti-vaxxers to prevent people who want to get the vaccine from getting it. You want mask mandates, social distancing, lockdowns etc. to end then they should be encouraging people who *want* the vaccine to go get it.
4034	108944	"""@realDonaldTrump What Azar appears to be saying is that a coronavirus vaccine, once it is developed, will be left to the private marketplace rather than to government procurement. Private businesses, """"will actually sort out the demand, purchasing, stocking, etc."""""""
4035	111287	Omg they have just confirmed that this J&amp;J vaccine causes the immune system to attack the nervous system! And they’re exporting it!!!
4036	110099	#NoVaccinePassports - I’ll fully boycott all vaccine passport venues/businesses, even if they support it now then change in future, I’ll never darken their door again with my business or orders. Is there a data base or group going with a list? Let's put them in 2 tiers instead!
4037	108004	Bill Gates does not want to admit that the Coronavirus is DEAD and EVERYBODY is testing POSTIVE for the ANTIBODIES that KILL the VIRUS. Bill Gates wants to KEEP the VIRUS and FEAR ALIVE so that he can make MONEY on the VACCINES and FLU SHOTS that he will produce next year.
4038	112772	So it’s not ready yet, but he already knows it won’t be very effective. Sounds a lot like the flu vaccine. In a typical year you have 25-50% efficacy.Why bother?  If you want it, get it, but no reason to force everyone to get it.
4039	201847	My 89 year old Dad received Part 1 of his vaccine today. Thankful and relieved! ❤️#covid #tuesdayvibe #COVID19 #vaccine #vaccinated #vaccinate #ADPH

4042	112290	@Kopter__FJA @1K3CH1 Covid-19 vaccine  from  China,  do  you  want?  For  export  only!!!  If  you  need,please  pm  me.
4043	110116	COVID-19 does not exist. No one needs to wear a face covering, socially distance, self isolate, or get the so-called vaccine.
4044	108099	They openly say the vaccine doesn't stop the spread or protect you. It has fucking jellyfish in it so they can see it glow in the dark. It's a psyop.
4045	108659	@cedarproduct Airbags work; I still put a seatbelt on when I get in a car.Vaccines significantly reduce the risk of illness and death, they don't eliminate it completely. Never have, and never will. Our vigilance must be proportional to the risk presented. Covid-19 is deadly and contagious.
4046	112513	@CP24 Not a chance got my 1st dose of the vax and my face went numb and I still don’t have feeling back on my left cheek. I also have tingling in my fingers  and arm. Went and got it checked and the doctor doesn’t know what’s wrong but attributed it to the #vaccine #COVID19
4047	110666	Lmaooo how are Republicans upset about who gets the vaccine and in what order when coronavirus is a made up pandemic to them? I'm lost...
4048	109673	After hearing that federal staff is being forced to get the Covid-19 vaccine in order to work and public businesses incentives to get the vaccine.  If you are interested in knowing what your legal rights are send me a message and I will get you the information that will help you
4049	112347	@DaveOshry I genuinely wanna immigrate to NZ if there's no coronavirus vaccine, please write me a letter of recommendation (I think that's how it works)
4050	112658	@BrianKohler2 @MzSha79 @ChancellorTV That's exactly what he said. He never specified with what or against what.The vaccine doesn't stop the virus. It reduces the symptoms. The virus is called SARS-Cov-2The vaccine deals with COVID-19 which is the symptoms not the virus
4051	110140	Ok so, they can’t give teenage girls Midol in school for cramps but they can get vaccines in elementary 😂😂
4052	112726	@GPrime85 @ooana We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies. Ask the FDA about it.
4053	109384	@thehill Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
4054	110257	Herd immunity is arriving.  Fauci and the rest who were hoping for a windfall from those vaccines are going to be pissed. @mitchellvii
4055	202054	Just finish playing Dr. Vee. Not my staff calling  me to complain of pain on the Covid19 vaccine spot and having funny feelings 🥴 no one told me being HR comes with Doc role play.
4056	110902	"@NotAlexSheppard I know loads, but they don't call it ""Flu"" anymore 'cos the WHO recommended 75% uptake of flu vaccine has only been hit twice in 21yrs. So they renamed it covid-19 and quickly developed a new vaccine which they are pushing for everybody to take 😏"
4057	110020	My fellow Arkansans and Americans more widely, please get the COVID vaccine. If pro-economy is your thing, then do so to avoid another shutdown. If pro-life is your thing, then do so to protect our kids. #Arkansas
4058	111133	@Teensthack @HospitalsApollo @HospitalsApollo they are Delhi biggest chor in health services. It's not just about vaccines even in normal days they treat people like customers not like patients. #COVID19
4059	111573	And here we go.Watch as they roll out the vaccine passports, and I continue to not get one.I'll live in an earthen hut on the edge of society, and it still won't be good enough for the feds.  It wasn't good enough for them when the Weavers did it, and Ruby Ridge happened.
4060	201895	Can’t raise my right arm because it hurts so much, and it feels like I have a light cold, but otherwise those are the “worse” post vaccine symptoms so far. I’ll take it! #COVID19 #covidvacccine
4061	108138	They may want to stop reporting this if they want people to be vaxxed. This further makes the point that the vaccine does not stop spread. Now with symptoms lesser why does everyone need a shot that doesn’t work.
4062	111134	Do you love baseball and not dying?Head to an @ABQTopes game! @NMDOH is giving out vaccines in the stadium! If you get the shot you get FREE tickets to a future game! There are not many chances to get vaccinated while drinking a $12 beer - don't miss this unique opportunity!
4063	111867	@MLevitt_NP2013 @TheLancet I’m glad at this time in society we’re just calling out all the BS as we see it. I wonder how skewed these “death toll” numbers from COVID-19 really are, and why after a few short months is there hope for a vaccine THIS year? Too many in answered questions. It’ll come out tho.
4064	110840	@realDonaldTrump Why don't you help by starting the transition to Biden who  will take the Coronavirus seriously and actually help America get out of this Pandemic, instead!!??  Battling the coronavirus is more important now,  The vaccines are not released yet a$$hole
4065	108335	irl is not very smart. she thinks they are making a cure for coronavirus rn. ma’am. they’re making a vaccine. she insists no no no not the vaccine they’re making a cure. MAAM. you CANT CURE A VIRUS.
4066	109166	@districtai @CDCgov The only bright side is they have to stop treating unvaxed as second class citizens. Now that vaxed spread Covid-19 too, they can't guilt us into getting the vaccine to save others. No reason to mandate the vaccine. People can decide for themselves if they need the vaccine.
4067	107827	"@WayneDupreeShow Nope. Not taking a vaccine for this coronavirus. Might refuse to take a vaccine ever again if they all start including ""tracking"" chips or 'digital tattoos'."
4068	112209	@4dmbrown @mi6rogue @BorisJohnson It does prevent infection. It’s an effective vaccine that will protect someone who receives it by lowering the chance of getting COVID-19 if the person encounters the coronavirus.
4069	111691	You couldn't invent corruption like this. Trump buys Moderna vaccine after a member of their board just happens to resign before the contract award and is involved in the selection process...
4070	202060	Timely. I was recently reminded to check the coverage for vaccine side effects also by my friend.Please do, you guys :)
4071	107765	Biden is actually moving like COVID-19 vaccine- not following the process.Presidents need 4 years to select their cabinet.
4072	110038	so let me get this right, we are quick to develp a vaccine for corona but still no proper cure for cancer after all these years! 🤔😭 #coronavirus
4073	111612	@hivetosurvive @NHSEngland @RoyalLondonHosp @CliveMyrieBBC If you use my theory it explains 5-11sMy theory is we been weakened by flu jabs containing coronavirus or bird flu or H5N1 ur pick but are all the same5-11 only have nasal spray not jabbedSo they have very little recievers in them
4074	107699	Omicron is as contagious as measles &amp; mumps but I've never known anyone to have either of them thanks to actual vaccines providing immunity like vaccines do. Will we EVER get an actual vaccine for Covid-19 so we can stop the spread? The current shot is not it.
4075	108990	Big testing numbers and also even bigger weekend vaccine administrations. Thanks for getting tested or a shot.I know it's tough times at the moment but we can still get through this.Do #GetVaccinated very soon if you're eligible but haven't done so.#COVID19VIC
4076	110552	We are in an amazing position to overcome Covid19 because of what the President did to get these vaccines developed. He moved mountains. Yet, Dems will not give him credit and neither will the antivaxer Trumpers. Complete ingratitude.

4079	112589	#Moderna’s stock has gone from $18.23 on Feb 21st to $80.57 on May 18th. That sinking feeling you have might be because they are running a “pump and dump” scheme? Time will tell if their vaccine is real or just hype. #Covid19 #coronavirus #TrumpVirus #CoronaOutbreak

4081	111993	@Citizen004 Would this only apply to COVID-19 vaccines? If so, why? Would it stop at vaccines? Sorry, you can’t come in, I think your might have HIV, can you prove you don’t? Sorry, that cold sore tells me you have herpes, can’t risk you coming in!
4082	111999	There is no vaccine for SARS after seventeen years and there is no vaccine for MERS seven years on. These are two strains of Coronavirus. So it is highly unlikely that there will be a vaccine for SARS-COV-2 which leads to COVID-19.

4084	107721	Flu vaccines only ‘partially’ work and sometimes not at all.  What makes anyone think a coronavirus vaccine will be any better?
4085	111750	@ALGhammer Meanwhile the Netherland are starting a lawsuit against the lock downs and the manditory vaccine. Stating 89-94% of PCR are false positive and they now know Covid-19 is just a normal flu. Nothing to worry about. Keep an eye on this.
4086	109658	If there’s any chance of controlling this until a proven vaccine is actually viable then that is to shut the international borders, keep them ALL closed, that’s why other countries have managed to do better! @cafreeland @NDP @liberal_party @RosieBarton @EvanLSolomon #COVID19
4087	108604	A sub-point I am thinking about talking about is how there has been some research done that getting the Covid-19 vaccine messes with some people's reproductive systems. This could be a scary fact for some young girls debating on if they are going to get the vaccine or not.
4088	108926	"somewhere out there someone is being woken up by the mike pence taking the coronavirus vaccine push notification from twitter saying ""i don't give a fuck about that cracker"""
4089	109666	Question? If vaccines are going to soon be updated to include protection (potentially) from a new variant, why would you rush out and get the old version and then not be protected? That’s like getting an old iPhone when the new ones just come out no? 🤯 #COVID19
4090	111490	@JasonMillerinDC Yes Jason;Of course you'd have to take into account no one wants you to be successful.  Half your voters don't support an Coronavirus intervention.Its amazing you've decided to wear masks.Why not volunteer to skip the vaccine?These vaccines are despite Donald Trump.

4092	111132	There is zero way to defeat this virus unless everyone is vaccinated. Everyone. This bs does not keep anyone safe. It just prolongs our agony and moves us closer to a potential that we create a variant for which vaccines no longer work.

4098	109995	My background is in science. “Novel” COVID-19 virus currently has no cure, no treatment, no vaccine. COVID-19 is currently transmitted in 68% of cases by extended families showing NO SYMPTOMS! Each person transmits to 2-38 people. Do you have children? Do you want responsibility?

I google it. 1st search result: ""No clear link between COVID-19 vaccines and sudden hearing loss."" Pit of my stomach propaganda feel. Would they be honest if it did?"
4104	202034	They haven't vaccinated all the pensioners and Frontline workers,,,,, my 75 mom stil waiting for second jab
4105	111242	@Gaylilintrovert @POTUS It my duty to take a vaccine I am not confident is safe to protect anyone. If you are concerned about Covid19 and want the vaccine- go get it. If everything is as it should be. Me getting the vaccine is irrelevant because you have it.
4106	108356	Your un-aided immune system defends the human body like a home owner with a set of steak knives. They'll get the job done, maybe, but things are going to get messy.Vaccines are the 2A of the immune system. Providing your body with an arsenal of weapons.
4107	111607	Puhsuhnally I want all the diff vaccines available so I cud get super powers no cap...if it works like that in fiction why not real life eh
4108	109732	These are scarier times and getting scarier. ICE is transporting kids to coronavirus hot spots, trump told governors to find their own medical supplies, Big Pharma forced congress to make a bill saying there is no limit to their income from any future vaccine. Is this real life?
4109	110611	@TheRightMelissa Otherwise they don't have to create the vaccine to achieve their goal bcz the covid19 will do it.
4110	107691	In our stake leadership meeting, the stake president just organized a 48 hour initiative to have every person within our stake boundaries aged 70 and up registered for an appointment to receive the COVID-19 vaccine sometime during the next two weeks, if they so desire. (Utah Cty)
4111	110199	@CortesSteve Useless vaccines, today... what will be mandated tomorrow?Vaccines don't even prevent coronavirus! Stupid.
4112	202230	Just out of pure curiosity as I let my mind wander unescorted:Can the public raise a class action law suit against a government for ineptitude?#Australia specifically. All the issues with #COVID19 and the #CovidVaccine made me start wondering.It's a #brainfart thought tbh.
4113	110641	2) Humanitarian aid is important one but the question is ‘how’? The long delay of COVID-19 vaccine distribution is because regime want to directly handle it and they want to legitimize itself.
4114	112450	This event would be more worthwhile if we threw it open to everyone who wants a booster/third dose to get one. The JCVI have ok’d it, so get on with it.
4115	108964	I guess I’ll find out what it’s like to be on the other side of the bars then!! I’m NOT doin’ it! They can take their vaccine and stick it up their a$$!
4116	110686	@zerohedge @Thatsalrighty How about no flights from China until the Wuhan virus has a vaccine? Why do all these virus come from Asia?
4117	112677	"Just maybe if Republicans would speak out, ""GET THE VACINE.""  This is why there is such a devide in our Country. Did Mitch McConnell get the vaccine. Why wasn't that brought out. People are becoming less trusting because of people like M.McConnell and especially Mr Trump."
4118	109381	Question: Why do we think it’s necessary to broadcast the make of the vaccine we’ve received? I’ve seen it in so many names on this app! And why do we have to share vaccination pics &amp; vaccination cards? What’s the psych behind it all? 🤔🧐 #asktwitter #COVID19 #VaccinationCovid
4119	109269	The people who don't want to get the Covid vaccine because they think it's not that serious are the same ones who buy lottery tickets thinking they're going to be rich. #COVID19#COVID
4120	112456	"It's not a vaccine against covid19, it's a vaccine against bad publicity. It wasn't bought to protect us, obviously, but to provide a ""hero"" distraction for Morrison, whenever he needed it."
4121	107876	@vonderleyen There's no post-covid world in sight until W.T.O. member countries change their laws so that companies could produce generic versions of any coronavirus vaccines and Covid-19 treatments.
4122	110213	COVID-19 vaccines, like flu shots, don’t work as well for new strains of the virus.  For that, you will need perpetual immunization, say vaccine makers.
4123	110980	This is great. They (quietly) rolled it out a month or two ago and I’ve been using it as my vaccine record when I go places since. Highly recommend because it’s *so* simple and comes directly from the DOH.
4124	108464	Everyone is so surprised about the #DeltaVariant but this is literally how viruses work. You make a vaccine, and the virus mutates. Repeat.The coronavirus is going to have to become part of our general pool of viruses, like the flu
4125	108715	@News24 1. Realistically, how far away is a vaccine to Coronavirus?2. How long is it until South Africa would inline to get it?3. What percentage of the population would need to have recieved it before its unclassified as pandemic?
4126	109308	⬇️ We must limit our movement if we want to limit the virus. Just until we get the vaccines rolled out. We can all do this.
4127	110173	My COVID-19 vaccine is almost ready. We will first test it in AFRICA and if it works they will get it for free because they can't afford to buy any.
4128	112924	@Bananadogs3 @davidfrum @codename_karla And all around so-called 3d world,  where we’re headed if we don’t dump all Republicans in every election, humans are getting COVID19 tho begging for vaccines &amp; can’t get any but for the top 1% richest/most powerful! The disconnect is appalling! Here 25% brainwashed want no shot!
4129	112029	Or all the medical/research communities could share findings to help create a vaccine together? Lmao I HOPE someone else gets a vaccine before we do so y’all can understand that sometimes everyone needs help 🤦🏻‍♀️
4130	107787	Its crazy how hard these guys are working to deny Trump any credit even AFTER the election.I didn't vote for him but he did get the vaccine part of this right.  We are on pace to have a vaccine far faster than estimates.If you don't want it, I'll take your place in line.
4131	108610	@lindyqb5 You are not the only one, thankfully. I have not and do not plan to take the COVID-19 vaccine. There's still hope for intellect and common sense Lindy 😀😀.

4133	112869	How do y’all come up with the stat that half of us won’t take the vaccine.. do y’all remember being polled? Cause I don’t
4134	108037	@rarelyused123 @samanthamarika1 I never said I was anti- vaccine.  I'm up to date on all my vaccinations.  If you can make a coherent argument for why I should get this COVID-19 vaccine, I'll listen.  Please include studies, numbers, and statistics.I'll wait.
4135	108562	This is the difference between China and USA. China wants the world to have access to any vaccine. USA wants its private pharmas to have patents so they can make money, maximise prices ensuring poor countries have no access. Which do you honestly prefer? #Covid_19
4136	109235	@KassandraKitson The Coronavirus vaccine is the seasonal flu shot but with an added microchip the size of a pepper flake. They never said it would work nor does it have to work. A digital global currency is the goal of the elite.
4137	109721	@jonfarquhar1 @PereginusD @Pammd6 @JaneMorganNZ1 @viewspotnz The common cold is a coronavirus, yet no vaccine has ever been developed to prevent it. Why? Because it's a moving target with new variants being its only constant. Sound familiar? The current crop of approved jabs would not deliver me any benefit.
4138	111958	@PattyMurray @SenatorCantwell @RepDerekKilmer @RepJayapal I will definitely wait for my vaccine if it meant those in prison get it, first.
4139	108472	@Melcatzzzz @Danza109 This is why I was strong on vaccines. No kid should be without a parent if a vaccine is available. I understand a genuine phobia but speak to your doctor is my advise. Not any Twitter expert or someone like me. Qualified doctors should be making people change their views

In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
4142	202408	#CovidVaccine experience details for those leery of vaccination:  Pfizer, 1st injection: sore arm, napped ( nothing new here 😁). Second injection: sore arm, sought undeserved sympathy ( none received), elated feeling of relief and freedom. #Pfizer #COVID19 #vaccinated
4143	109228	the vaccine systems are super confusing, you really have to almost do detective work or be tech savvy. it's getting easier, but we need to do better
4144	112155	Merck dropping two vaccine candidates due to poor immune response. A good reminder that we are very fortunate that the first few vaccines out of the blocks work so well.
4145	111896	Explain why a #vaccine for a virus, with 99.5 % survivability for anyone over 70, is being pushed?@epdevilla@fordnation@JohnTory When people realise what is being done... they will prevail. @Alec_Zeck you need to sit on health task forces #COVID19 #COVID19Ontario
4146	107785	They trying to charge u up to $260 for something that doesnt have a vaccine lmao i understand the STD/STI u can get it cured . But CORONA?! There is no vaccine so why are yall trying break ppls pockets !? Ontop of we not working much at the moment . Thats a hustle if u ask me
4147	109822	@LeeExplores Great stats Lee! Makes me sad and disappointed that people still don't understand, coronavirus is here to stay and won't be going anywhere soon. The vaccine is still in development and until we get it, then we can safely go back to normality!
4148	112875	At the doctor again. COVID-19 caused a hardening of my arteries that is causing circulatory issues and other symptoms. They are changing my medications once again.The good news is there is no medical reason any of the COVID vaccines wont be safe for me#dspiffycovidjourney

4152	110454	@LegrisDan @LetitiaMontana Exactly, i mean pretty soon they’ll take away our guns and force us all to have abortions 2 months after our babies are born and then they’ll implant tracking chips in our bodies with “vaccines” they say protects us from coronavirus and then they’ll steal our land to share ...
4153	202308	Like a common man, PM @narendramodi ji got his first dose of vaccine today. He became the first to take a Covid shot today as nationwide vaccination of persons above 60 and those over 45 with illnesses began.#COVID19Vaccine #COVID19 #COVIDVaccine #Modi https://t.co/BC9IPAvRVY

See the difference?
4155	112635	@dinotalkspol @BreitbartNews Because nobody receiving the coronavirus vaccine believes in God. So Muslims shouldn’t get the vaccine? Should they pray it away too?
4156	202094	@CDCgov I hope that this is not too personal or embarrassing, but I wanted to ask a question. Can getting the COVID-19 vaccine cause a woman to have her Menstruation Cycle?I got my first Pfizer shot on Thursday and 2nd one will be in May. Stay well.
4157	108032	"This is a constant conversation at work. ""Will they make us get the vaccine?"" Not one science-lovin' healthcare worker I know wants anything to do with a November vaccine."
4158	112086	Racism exists in almost every country in the world.It is a dismal disease like the covid-19 virus, which is currently being combated by vaccinating people with a vaccine that resists the virus.I hope that the laboratories will also work to find a vaccine against virulent racism
4159	110499	@WilliamMkimsey @Uncle_Sammich Thanks for the article. I’m pretty well versed in the stats of this stuff. I’m a health care actuary and this has been a huge part of my world since March. And I agree that a vaccine is our best chance, but we’ve never successfully vaccinated a coronavirus. So we’ll see.

4162	108878	@tammy753540711 @peytonyager @FOX4 The flu vaccine is just a best guess, maybe they predict the right strain or maybe not.The CoVID-19 vaccine is for the original and only minimally protects from variants.

4165	110383	The unvaccinated represent a control group for this experiment that govs and pharma desperately don't want.If vaccines do induce ADE reaction they are liable. We're in bigger trouble as this exacerbates pathogens and leads to multi-system/immuno-compromisation.Time will tell.
4166	112074	This pandemic will not be over until it’s over for everyone, everywhere. I’m calling on @BioNTech_Group to pledge their commitment to making sure the COVID-19 vaccine is distributed fairly and equitably across the world. #OneWorldProtected
4167	110160	I am extremely Pro-Vaccine and hope everyone wants and gets vaccinated but I don't agree with what this judge did.

4187	108162	JUST IN - U.S. Army: Soldiers who refuse to get a COVID-19 vaccine will be immediately discharged, Reuters reports.
4188	108496	So this vaccine does not kill the virus but stimulates the person's immune response? So who is the target for such a vaccine?
4189	111670	Honestly, this is such a great, fun, awesome way to celebrate the shot. When I can get #myshot I'm going to go all out--especially when I get my second one! Thank you @_NancyMD for sharing this. We can do this...we're getting there. #vaccineswork #vaccinessavelives
4190	109657	@SheIsRachele @FoxNews The difference is coronavirus is never going away it will require booster shots etc until the end of time and the vaccine is not immunity it simply helps nerf it down for those who have immune problems or can’t fight it off naturally like a old person yet they still press for all
4191	112049	@deadsilence954 @JCLeonard561 @POTUS I think you get a dopamine rush from calling people sheep and acting as if everyone isn’t as informed as you. Ego. The technology behind the vaccine has been studied for years before Covid19. I’m an educator, not a virus specialist but I trust the scientists.
4192	108044	@CNN According to Trump, Covid-19 may not come back this Fall (only embers) and the heat of the summer and sunshine may keep it away. My only question is anyone working on a vaccine?? How can anyone take him seriously any more!!
4193	202090	Finally got my flu shot today. I know it’s not the same as the Covid-19 vaccine, but I’m really hoping Bill Gates put a chip in this one, too, so I can finally have some direction in life.
4194	110888	@pauldundas85 @ChrisLynnPhoto @ShelaghFogarty Covid vaccines MAY be associated with chronic auto immune conditions. If I’m at very little risk of coronavirus, why would I take this potentially unknown risk of the vaccine? Obviously this doesn’t apply for everyone but as a young healthy individual I have my doubts

4202	107764	AstraZeneca agreed to give Oxford $10 million up-front and another roughly $80 million in so-called milestone payments if the vaccine passes regulatory and sales hurdlesThat’s in addition to around 6% of royalties Oxford can make if the vaccine succeeds

4204	201817	I am not taking the vaccine as I have had Covid-19 already and thankfully survived. I have tested + for antibodies 6 months after my infection. I am in a very low risk category that has been confirmed from my recovery.If you have an issue with that...it's a you problem.
4205	202333	@CDCgov I've had my first an second vaccination, and just got my 3 Covid-19 vaccination shot on Wednesday, and it wasn't a booster but a extra shot for immunocompromised.

4208	110576	it's understandable that a COVID19 vaccine is taking some time, as the virus is prone to mutation and thus if scientists begin a culture with one strain then realize the population is mainly affected by another, they may be forced to.................................cancel culture
4209	109486	@chipfranklin I see it like this, if you get Covid-19 you don't know how bad you will get You could get a mild case a rough case or possibly bad enough to die.

4226	108963	Billions more likely.And their stock was tanking until everyone wanted their vaccine.They've made a killing while millions have died.If airports were closed so the different variants weren't spread, it would have ended the pandemic#COVID19
4227	112007	@adamseconomics @DanielAndrewsMP It’s all about the $$$$$, if hydroxychloroquine can be used to treat Coronavirus then there won’t be a need for a vaccine, and we all know Big Pharma wants a vaccine because that’s the Big $$$$$, so why is #DanAndrews banning it?.#COVID19Vic,
4228	108053	@KUSINews Very sad ... the misconceptions about the Covid-19 vaccines!  Why?  Because once you have taken the vaccine you can still get Covid and you can still spread the illness if you get it!  That simple!
4229	202452	This is not related to GOT7 but I just got my second shot of the COVID-19 vaccine. Now I’m officially vaccinated.What a great day✨
4230	112523	C'mon @markknoller, dude. There is no vaccine. It's irresponsible to parrot what Trump's minions say without also noting that it's total BS. There is no vaccine. It's not hard. There is no vaccine.
4231	110277	.@MontgomeryCoMD @MoCoCouncilMD @MontCoExec Please consider this study (&amp; others) when contemplating vaccine mandates. Everyone does not need a vaccine -- natural immunity is quite valid.
4232	112697	@NYDailyNews The Chinese Communists are only good at copying, not smart or quick enough to create a good Covid-19 vaccine for the virus that they originally created in the Wuhan Lab, then released into the world.
4233	112317	@PaulSorrentino3 Why would they bother when the vaccine does not prevent them from getting Covid19, and it enhances their chances of spreading it?
4234	110913	I am no defender of the Russian state but why did they have to attempt to hack this?If ever there was something all the major powers could work together on, pooling expertise and resources, it’s a COVID vaccine?
4235	202327	I got the second COVID-19 vaccine shot yesterday. Kicking my butt a little harder than expected this morning.No regrets. Trying not to be a baby about it, but I'll probably spend most of the day in bed.
4236	109523	This is the New York Post so 😒 but anyway, the 3 people didn’t get very sick which is exactly what the vaccine does and they didn’t get anyone else sick. So the vaccine worked.
4237	109781	I sort of figured this would be the way of it for a while. I mean, the vaccine doesn’t absolutely stop you from catching and spreading the virus. If you have enough antibodies, you might not contract it or get it more mildly, but a mild case is enough to spread it to unprotected.
4238	112289	"@GOPLeader I get a flu shot every year and have never gotten the flu. However, I'm not going to take this ""fast tracked"" vaccine until it's been properly tested. Testing takes time especially to verify that there are no side effects that could be worse than Coronavirus."
4239	110891	@DrTedros @hagegeingob @WHO @WHONAMIBIA @MoHSSNamibia If the advanced economies of the world do not liberate COVID-19 vaccine patents for 3 YEARS, the pandemic will return with a vengeance to all nations, including the vaccinated ones. It's like this virus has AI. It adapts and takes advantage of humanity's errors, in record time.
4240	111869	@magnoliafarm @Thomas1774Paine First, there is the flawed PCR test. Then, there are scientists who say that anyone one who received a flu vaccine in the past will test positive for the viral fragments they are claiming to be attributable to the coronavirus.
4241	109729	Just phoned the doctors surgery today to ask about the vaccine, they haven't got a clue about it and don't know when it will be rolled out.  Where is the Oxford vaccine and when will it be available? We are dying out here.
4242	109047	Science to the rescue. I also remain optimistic philanthropist will work out a way to get the good vaccine to poorer countries. Not all is doomed.
4243	111747	@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump Yes I am scratching my head. If it’s all a hoax then  why require a vaccine for COVID-19 ,or if it is a little flu or it is fading. This proved that Trump has been lying all the time, bigly
4244	111665	@realDonaldTrump Hey,  So heads up.... I wasn’t allowed to say anything until today, but it's now okay for me to share that I volunteered for the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer. The vaccine is the one that has been developed in Russia. It is in 6 different stages and I received my first dose 1/2
4245	111729	In Japan, the COVID-19 vaccine is not available for people aged 65 and older until after mid-April.However, most people with underlying medical conditions and those in their 50s want to get the vaccine as soon as possible, they don't even know when they can get it.
4246	109963	@realDonaldTrump @jimcramer @CNBC These are people going back to work. SLOWLY. There is no guarantee these jobs will stick. No job or life is secure until there is a vaccine for COVID19.People are distracted by the death of George Floyd and the resulting protests. Just know-You didn’t create these jobs!
4247	109553	@TommyDoc36 Aye you have them well taped whit an attitude once we’ve got a vaccine for Covid19 think we need to see if we can get one for stupidity
4248	111950	I don’t understand why this is shocking. Even the Global Good Samaritan Gates’ calls for funding vaccine development were peppered with references to capitalism and private profit
4249	108297	"""Seasonal flu is only """"seasonal"""" in the US BECAUSE there is a vaccine.  COVID-19 will burn through the global population again &amp; again until a vaccine is developed. It will infect and reinfect millions each and every year. Won't NEARLY be the last novel Coronavirus either."""
4250	201858	This was a very pleasant experience despite the stadium being woefully difficult for the mobility challenged. Staff were very kind and quick to offer wheelchair assistance, and it wasn’t very crowded today at all. Our Pfizer jabs were done with expert skill in a few minutes.
4251	202372	Walked into #CVS to return unopened Halloween candy, walked out with a Pfizer COVID-19 Booster Shot. Came home and my college diploma from nearly 6 months ago was sitting on my front step. I am killing it. I am blessed.

4255	107934	Yes why @POTUS? No vaccine for me.  We already have things that work like our own immune systems if you treat them right plus other therapeutics. I don’t trust anybody in the pharmaceutical industry.
4256	108038	@Rectitude20 1. I will not take a Covid19 vaccine. 2. I will not take any of today’s vaccines. 3. There is not one vaccine on the market today that has been proven necessary, safe &amp; effective. 4. I will educate my family &amp; friends as to the truth behind vaccines. please RT.
4257	110886	Seymour questioned why Kiwis may have to wait until March to get a Covid-19 vaccine when the UK plans to roll one out next week. Effective and safe vaccines are very cost-effective health care interventions, which are the great triumphs of modern medicine. We want a safe vaccine.
4258	112574	"@MattHancock @UniofOxford When the present crisis is under control, pls also throw everything you've got at a #crohns vaccine. It ""only"" affects around 2% of the population but for those people (usually immune compromised) it is every bit as life-altering as #COVID19 has been for 100%. Don't stop here!"
4259	109637	@News24 There is not pure truth about this vaccinesEven though it is proven by SAHPRA; however it doesn't guarantee any effectiveness it might have our lives, what I see is that, we'll all take the vaccines shot up until post  COVID-19 Since our government is also turning against us.
4260	108145	@WADeptHealth your PSA calls the #COVID19 gene therapy a “vaccine”. It is NOT a vaccine. Please stop lying to people and call it what it is. Or do YOU not even realize it’s gene therapy?
4261	201993	fitting given that I just scheduled my first covid-19 vaccine! 🥳🥳 @ uw madison students UHS just opened up a bunch of slots
4262	111209	@saundees21 Yeah it’s a big fat NO for me first off I already had covid19 and have the antibodies but even so I would never get the vaccine
4263	109322	If u r triple vaccinated have a negative Covid19 test and you still need to isolate @JustinTrudeau how can any reasonable rational person believe vaccines work?  #NoVaccineMandate #TruckersForFreedom #TruckersForFreedom #TrudeauCoward
4264	111849	I quite fancy getting the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. Not that I care either way which vaccine I eventually get. But I like that this one isn't profiteering as much as the other two.
4265	109042	This is the way to deal with Covid! The masks are not working! The vaccines are not working! Therapeutics like monoclonal antibodies to treat the disease is the way to go!
4266	112237	@JohnCornyn I’ve only had the polio vaccine in my life, I never get the flu, and been around plenty of Covid19... I’ll watch and review first.
4267	110333	This is what they plan 2 turn us all in2.. HUMAN CYBORG ROBOTS!That vaccine they will FORCE us all 2 take will ALTER our DNA forever....
4268	202295	I will not risk my life in Australia for a vaccine apparently targeting a virus that will eventually disappear... If I was elsewhere right now, my decision my be different.QLD has been doing just fine without covid-19 vaccines.
4269	109640	@LSW1261267251 @MailOnline I will decide if and when I want a coronavirus jab, NOT The government! How do I know it is even safe?
4270	108176	If the COVID vaccines are vaccines they would stop you catching it. After all, with a polio vaccine we don’t still catch polio.
4271	202348	Just before Christmas so they can all go and spread it around at close family gatherings. You have to wonder if this kind of thing is done on purpose to increase cases &amp; justify the push and lockdowns for the next jab. My daughter's friend was one of these poor people.
4272	202015	You’ve got to keep the vaccine at a certain temperature, then get people that first shot in a timely manner, or the product expires. Then get them a second shot 3-4 weeks later. Having identified the best candidates for the vaxx, you have this:
4273	110757	Very useful for everyone who does not want to take the vaccine but is facing increasing pressure from peers and/or family.
4274	107863	I just seen this on ABC. This is has turned into a lottery just to get people to take the vaccine smh.
4275	112473	We all need to work together to protect the world from #COVID19. Will @g20org states please step up and release much needed funds for response efforts to @WHO @CEPIvaccines and @gavi? Together, we can beat this pandemic.
4276	109163	@CharlieMod1 @piersmorgan I’m not a doctor so I wouldn’t say. Before you take any please consult your doctor. There’s no drug or vaccine for Coronavirus so it’s the doc’s decision. Trump must be taking that with his personal physician’s advise
4277	112380	Reading this just makes me want to give up life.And then I think I am not gonna make it easy for you. I am going stay here and fight against this until my last breath.#NoVaccinePassportsAnywhere
4278	110691	I think the question will you get vaccinated for #COVID19 is a bit of a rigged question. I am not against vaccines, &amp; I fall into a high risk category if I were to get #Coronavirus. I want a vaccine, but the question is do I trust the #Trump Admin to deliver a safe vaccine? No!
4279	202243	Can’t wait for this to be over, I’m gonna eat on restaurants, go to the movies and party like I have never in my life. Give me my vaccine already 😭😭
4280	109634	@KoreyKruse @Rod_Rescueman @AmyAThatcher So why would you want to wait til you get a  viral lung infection like covid19 and take livestock medication for a parasitic intestinal worm when you can take a vaccine made for humans to keep you from ever getting sick in the first place
4281	110700	I get my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine tomorrow and while I’m actually super nervous about it, I’m happy to finally get it done 🥲
4282	111494	@dotsandloops21 @WGRZ This is an opinion. Even the military doesn’t want this vaccine. Specifically this vaccine. You people assume we refuse all vaccines. We don’t. Just the COVID-19 vaccines.
4283	110667	Cepat sikit meninggal. We want to go back to our normal lives as soon as possible. So kepada yg tolak vaccine, please kindly take yourself out. ☺
4284	108571	all of this knowing aaa DAMN well all vaccines do are disrupt our genes. everything they try to sell us harms us. it comes from the white man, WHY would they give us something beneficial?! completely beneficial? cmon they don’t care
4285	108406	@DavidLammy @BorisJohnson This guy is only thinking in the moment. What will happen if CoVid19 overlaps the flu season?? Realistically, if we're lucky, ll get a vaccine in 18 months (all coronavirus vaccine attempts have failed, so.. finger crossed). So how natural immunisation shouldnt be the main aim?
4286	107747	"""Kevin McCarthy @GOPLeader:  """"Dems delayed on acting on the coronavirus. Instead, they ran ads against Repubs and tried to sneak in provisions that would've delayed vaccine development."""""""
4287	108783	Got my first #COVIDVaccination today! It only took 19 mins. from walking in the door to getting the vaccine in my arm. Immediately got my appointment for the second shot.My kudos to everyone working @ThePitUNM and the @NMDOH to make it happen. #nmpol #COVID19 #GetVaccinated https://t.co/CUO5qvgSkT
4288	111766	Amazing what can happen when the scientists are respected and valued. This is an awesome achievement. I just wish my pals in covid vaccine development got the same respect and optimism about their societal contributions.
4289	111352	Get the jab. Boost my vaccine commission. Make me rich. Unbelievable that there are STILL many naive gullibles out there who believe Matt Hancock the MASSIVELY corrupt pink tied vaccine salesman has their best health interests at heart. He doesn’t. 🤦‍♂️🤣🥴💉💰💉💰💉💰👎
4290	108622	Not shocking. @CobbSchools elementary schools are being hit hard. This is the age group that can’t receive a vaccine and there’s no #maskmandate in place to curb spread. This is gross negligence - putting child lives in danger - intentionally. But #thisiscobb. @ccsdcovid
4291	107829	@realDonaldTrump Definitely but please have virtual sessions until there is #COVID19 vaccine and virus is under control. Kids have great immune but they are even greater careers. I have two elementary kids and opt in for virtual classes.
4292	110711	Is it just the way @Twitter’s algorithms are working my feed lately, or has the Coronavirus vaccine brought out every whacky “anti-vaxxer” account and shifted them into overdrive?Seriously- the vaccine is “Bill Gates Population Control?” Ya’ll have lost your damn minds.
4293	112302	@MattWalshBlog There will not be a vaccine for Covid19; just like there is not one for HIV, there will only be a course of treatment for COVID like for AIDS.
4294	111590	Imagine your vaccine being so bad that you need to cheat in the second trial after messing up the first one. Literally NOBODY is gonna take this vaccine at this point.
4295	201827	Sign me the fuck up! I've got my first 2 jabs. I live in Tn, these morons are still actively avoiding doing anything about controlling it.
4296	111752	@pdubdev @benshapiro Flu vaccine isn't 100% effective. It depends on strain as the virus mutates. So far we don't think that happens with covid-19 in the same way. Not certain though.
4297	111500	@william20673995 @Hoosiers1986 @DallasTexasMama There is a vaccine for the flu. There’s no vaccine for the coronavirus. And we are the only country suffering, just look what happened to Italy.
4298	112092	This is so important to discuss! My school told us we have to wait until the vaccine is widely available to the public and get it from our GPs. Yet, my mandatory ED rotation starts next month where I will undoubtedly come into contact with COVID.
4299	112123	"So 90% of 25-34 year olds intend to take the vaccine. With about 80-90% of people needed to take the vaccine for herd immunity.What am I missing here? Is ""herd immunity is looking very likely"" too positive."
4300	108479	@tabitha_mueller Leguen is full of it. My son has a chronic kidney condition and could get the vaccine in almost any other state. Meanwhile, people in Vegas are signing up to do just one uber shift to get it. This is a disgrace. #COVID19 #WorldKidneyDay

4303	108242	Shouldn't be an issue to share this. The 4th person who tried Earth Tea Extra Strength Against Covid19 back in April 2020 just told us they did blood work and was asked which vaccine they took. She responded didn't take it yet and the doctor said her blood work looks like she did
4304	112814	@RhubbaComedy @Florence_WHyde It’s a coronavirus from the same family of viruses that cause the common cold. If you’ve had this vaccine and you believe it’ll give you immunity, then why should you worry about others?
4305	109397	@piccmeeprizes So CYDY is that the biotech company out of Vancouver, WA? Just curious... And if so are they working on the Covid-19 vaccine? Thanks. @piccmeeprizes #PiccMeePrizeGuy #GetOnTheWheel

4311	108094	Reckon I got the virus in Kuala Lumpur or Malacca where I was for ten days before the flu jab. But I think it possible the flu jab weakened my immune system to a silent virus - most people who get covid19 have no symptoms. On the plus side I’ve had it so no fear!
4312	108458	@Alex_Neverm1nd @ChingusBingus1 @voiceoflg @BecauseReason11 @RealCandaceO Oh like the flu that has been around since 1912 and was never erraticated because coronavirus can never stop mutations and has had a vaccine for years and are not mandated because they only work 50% got it
4313	111068	So, this coming Sunday, 03/14, I'm going to receive my second does of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. Given that the second does is the one that most people get the symptoms after of feeling ill briefly, would anyone be interested in me documenting it in a thread here?

4316	111581	When someone tells you they have the right to refuse the vaccine, ask them if this is what they bargained for.

4321	110063	@davidaxelrod I think America is way past the”implications”part of this epic failure to respond to the Coronavirus pandemic.We are definitely in the”catastrophe”part. Now that the virus is endemic in our country,we have little chance of containing or mitigating it,until a vaccine
4322	110286	The funny thing is, they don’t even need the vaccine, just a recent negative Covid test. Don’t feel bad for these individuals in any way shape or form if they allow this to prevent them from going to a game.

4328	108112	@TheyTookMJ @phoenixashes189 Lol you proved my point. We have a vaccine for the flu, yet it still has a higher mortality rate than the coronavirus. A vaccine for covid will be just as useless as the flu vaccine because they mutate.
4329	110475	@JStuartAdams @BradWilsonGOP Stuart Adams and Brad Wilson are fools to insist on an immediate return to in person classes when we have a vaccine and are rolling it out (finally).  Remember their names and their disregard for human life. @slcschools

4338	111090	@potatoman245 The flu vaccine does not work, yet millions voluntarily get it every year. There has never been a successful coronavirus vaccine. Why would they be successful now? Even for proven vaccines like for polio, and other truly debilitating diseases, it should still be a choice.
4339	111931	@judyfromthebloc @JoeBiden What's the pay for a low-level science researcher or a lab intern working on a Covid-19 vaccine/treatment? If they are on salary, the pay might work out to less than $15 per hour or just a little more. Why go to school, study hard subjects, or take risks when you can get $15/hr?

As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies.
4342	110933	No more games, covid is having their stuff revealed in 10 or so months! I work for my parents floral company, within 1 month, 5 funerals, all from the vaccine. One died on the spot, 3 died 1 day after-cardiac arrest, and the last went to sleep and never woke up. wtf.#COVID19

4346	111470	Yup. And it isnt gonna happen. They're gonna wait until the shit hits the fan with this Covid19 surge. Localities will do shutdowns regardless of what state or fed says if things get too bad. Which they may once kids are all in school, &amp; if vaccine efficacy wanes as it appears.
4347	112005	"@jillpromoli Looks like ""small fringe society"" is bigger than they expected and isn't just in 🇨🇦 Get vaxxed they said it will protect u and things will return to normal they said..my question.. what is normal cuz 3 shots later n Covid-19 still spreading..supposedly"
4348	107795	Read the enclosed thread. This is from the companies involved in the vaccine they aren’t going Roth the program and will not participate in an election stunt. Let’s hope their CEO are ‘clean’. Otherwise Trump and Putin will find what they can and use it.
4349	111408	Try to understand if mask ✋ the spread of COVID-19 why is people that is wearing mask is still getting covid I don't understand why people is getting vaccine and still testing + for covid
4350	109889	@y2kennynyc @Zigmanfreud If you've got a sterilizing, highly effective coronavirus vaccine you're hiding, think now might be the time to tell the world...
4351	111565	Two moms at my kid’s daycare are planning a #coronavirus immunity party so their kids get it “before the government starts forcing vaccines.” Good times, living near the intersection of #SilverLake #LosFeliz and #AtwaterVillage 🤦🏼‍♀️ #coronaoutbreak #coronavirusla
4352	109131	"Scientists must stop making false promises like""we are about to make a breakthrough in finding coronavirus vaccine""."
4353	109392	@Miss_Tara_Red @ErisMartinet This is very true and I understand your position.  However, do be aware that there have been no vaccines found for the previous Coronavirus illnesses out there.  I am just hoping you don’t assume there will be one. A candidate might never be found.
4354	108573	Does this explanation make any sense to anyone?! Or is the FM just making up rubbish excuses... #Wales #Drakeford  #vaccine
4355	202084	@GovBillLee Hey, Guv, my mom just got her COVID-19 Vaccine after waiting......10 minutes. In Iowa. Why does our state have idiots running everything? #dosomework #VaccineStrategy #TN
4356	108111	#Coronil #vaccine?  This is how shortcuts for #coronavaccine are being dictated without any scope for shortcomings! Good going #India...
4357	111367	@MarkieMartin My cousin, thrice vaxxed and a stage 4 breast cancer survivor, was denied ma treatment yesterday after getting a positive Covid-19 diagnosis in NY. Bidens doing. He said if you aren't going help, get out of the way. Biden is the problem. He did this.
4358	111271	I do not mean to offend but have a lot of you seen people messaging about how the Lord apparently told them well done for not taking the Covid-19 vaccine? I had my vaccines done in march and may because I have type 1 diabetes, but in no way is this the mark, agree?
4359	112791	This is some weak ass bullshit. I sat on hold for hours to schedule my vaccine the minute I became eligible, and all I got was a sticker. Where's my gift card? This has college group project vibes written all over it, where the lazy get rewarded and the responsible get nothing.
4360	109217	"Anyone who fights back is risking his life. Courageous Americans still exist. If starvation doesn't kill us the vaccine will, if vaccine doesn't kill us a ""peaceful"" protester will... Gulag USA has begun."
4361	108208	I know that's right.  Who in the hell would take a vaccine named after trump who called Covid-19 a hoax, then said slow down the testing, then refused to get the amount of the vaccines that is needed for the American people.  Get real folks. This circus will soon be over.
4362	110141	Boosters for life, two fir a pound.....and to think ppl thought they'd get a wee jag or two 7 then they'd have their overseas herd holidays back.....eejits
4363	108617	@PeterZaitsev Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
4364	107763	Cancer is completely different then a coronavirus, you can't vaccinate for a cold because it's always a mix of different viruses that cause it. HIV is very complex and although we don't have a vaccine we do have treatments to make it almost undetectable.
4365	108525	@celliottability @fordnation @ONThealth 3of us in my household  got our second doses days apart in June - it would be nice to have our boosters done prior to the holidays to keep our youngest protected.  My kids want to be at school in January #onted
4366	110781	like why i told my mom yesterday i can explain how the vaccine worked and she said „no they’re going to give me coronavirus“
4367	108565	Human Trash Box @GovKemp thinks we've been fighting this virus from our living room.  I thought we were socially distancing to flatten the curve and find ways to live/ work until we have a vaccine.  But Trash Box got elected while holding a gun on a teenager, so here we are.
4368	111293	World wide vaccine prices in less price 1 USD enough ! People are poor all over world money purposes vaccine for coronavirus need to remove. Generic vaccine make and give. This will helps world come to normal situations fastly.
4369	110319	So potentially no vaccine, ever and you can catch #COVID19 again and again and again until it 1 day kills you.So pubs will never open, football is gone and we all living on a prison planet.No point in going work, no point in anything really.This just got really bad.
4370	110346	just got a Covid-19 vaccine for my mom feelin pretty good about it too considering i was watching them come and go in seconds #COVID19 #vaccine #Covid_19
4371	110258	@VlRTUALBOY I am going to put bugs in a smoothie with the coronavirus vaccine and some kale and sell it for 25$
4372	111912	"@OmarComing3 We could end 99% of vaccine hesitancy this week if we just agreed to call it ""Trump's Magical Warp Speed Juice"", so these poor fools will take their medicine already.  I wouldn't care if they only risked their own, but they're giving coronavirus a safe house to thrive &amp; mutate."
4373	110564	@BruceVotes @OwenJones84 Flu has a vaccine ,which protects and lessens,there is none for Coronavirus,had we not isolated,this would have been much higher
4374	112338	It seems vaccine refusal is very high! Next challenge is how we are going to break this streotype BS about COVID Vaccine!
4375	107917	...the exhaustion from getting my Pfizer COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine third booster shot and my annual flu vaccine shot together on Wednesday was kicking my ass. Then my therapist offered to cancel this week.I literally was so tired I forgot canceling was even an option!!! 😅
4376	202210	Just got my first COVID shot 🥳🎉🎊It’s so important to protect those around you, be safe out there everyone! #COVID19 #vaccinated #VaccinesWork  #EnsignContentCreation https://t.co/EDR5GGMcTf
4377	112404	Thank you @BharatBiotech We are there to support you in this mission, any vaccine progress is good and it would obviously come with an amount of risk. Believing your intention is good! All the best! Politics on science is not appropriated!
4378	112337	“Hey do you want to take this free vaccine so you can live?”“Hmm, can you sweeten the deal a bit?” “…free beer?”“Ok, I’ll do it”
4379	112188	@TheLastPersont2 @RidgeOnSunday @MattHancock You never get full immunity from coronaviruses, this vaccine all all others so far are only to reduce the severity of covid19, lesson the death rates. You will still catch the virus and still transmit the virus after being vaccinated. Lets get this right and we can move forward
4380	202148	Just got my second #COVID19 vaccine shot (was overseas January-end of May).Can barely feel the tracking chip. https://t.co/UvhMZ0UAxZ
4381	109923	This (unevidenced) cautionary tone implies vaccines don’t work. It undermine other government messages.They’re trying to be sensible, but they’re being very reckless. Just give us the good news. Vaccines work and it’s finally going well. Give people hope, man.
4382	202196	Good Morn Twerps. The Covid-19 Astra Seneca Vaccine is safe. Took it yesterday no adverse reaction. Pls take it let's end covid-19.
4383	109230	Good Morning!It is very wrong for any pastor to advice his members not to take Covid19 vaccines. It should be personal decisions. But, my fear is that this vaccines may not be potent when administered to Nigerians. Can't we develop our own vaccines? #FreedomSquare@solid1009
4384	111095	Well, I don't care if there a vaccine for this horrendous deadly martian disease killing all inhabitants of Earth. I wouldn't take it if there was.But, defund Congress until they allow the re-opening of all States. They are they reason that States are being so restrictive.
4385	110910	@heycrest @AfChloe If you have had the vaccine and you somehow get infected, there will be rapid response to the infection and it'll get eliminated. In intermediate steps, if you do an antibody (AB) test which detects AB against coronavirus, it'll be positive because your body is actively fighting
4386	108524	@SethAbramson The variant in COVID-19 can make you sicker, yes. But the vaccine will still work, it just gives more reason why we need have the vaccine quicker. It is a normal process for any virus to mutate.
4387	111664	@ElectricMiknik @SeamusDuke @coronavirus How are we supposed to live any sort of life until we have a vaccine then. Life is an unnecessary risk and If people don’t want to incur risk let them isolate if they so wish.
4388	109027	@DanRather This may sound harsh but I think all those elected officials who denied the science regarding COVID-19 should be denied the vaccine if and when it’s developed.  After all we can’t deny one science and then support another science it’s all and nothing
4389	110865	Trump is pushing hard for a vaccine; that's all he or any politician can do since so many Americans have stopped social distancing and mask wearing. Getting haircuts, going to bars and parties, protesting. Americans surrendered to Covid-19 out of selfishness and entitlement.
4390	108131	the only reason they're doing this in the first place is that they realize that the movement to suspend vaccine patents and make them free for any country to manufacture is gaining traction, keep it up
4391	108998	@CNN I will never trust Dr fauci or the vaccine please everyone for your own safety do not take the vaccine the put coronavirus patients in nursing homes to purposely kill a lot of people DO NOT TAKE THE VACCINE
4392	110876	Some low income countries fail to allocate funds to buy vaccines and wait to get it free. When would this ceaseless begging stops?
4393	111472	"@ChrisWickNews Because the vaccine doesn't work. There's never been a successful vaccine for anything in the Coronavirus family. But don't let liberals hear that, they'll show you how ""tolerant"" they really are."
4394	109069	@pcr123 @BJ_Gardener @pjlfc88 @PippaCrerar I’m not “fearful” of the unvaccinated, because I’ve had my #COVID19 vaccine, anxious yes,  because I don’t want to catch it &amp; be ill myself but more importantly I don’t want to pass it on to my loved ones!Talking off fearful, why won’t you have the vaccine? Could u b fearful?
4395	111510	#COVID19 #coronavirus #vaccine Dr Fauci saysScientists are hoping for a coronavirus vaccine that is at least 75% effective, but 50% or 60% effective would be acceptable.MY TAKE : 50%-60% is a low bar. The lower the bar the less likely people will take the vaccine
4396	202005	I just received my first COVID-19 shot today. There are so many reasons to get vaccinated and the biggest one is that you’re worth it! #PennStateHealth #Moderna #modernavaccine https://t.co/vbZnwlsupW
4397	108106	@1215Deb @SandiZStandee I'm 72.  I will only get a vaccine for Covid19 once they've developed and tested it.
4398	108196	@chrislhayes - COVID-19 is killing hundreds of thousands of people, the vaccine may be the answer, but maybe not, we just don’t know, but the next pandemic is around the corner. Why not talk about ending animal agriculture instead, this is where the pandemics are coming from!
4399	107921	Have 🇬🇧 we given this vaccine out already in our Britain? It appears so.. Then most of them are in that age group, due to our government's priority list.. Do we 🇬🇧 need to have a think about this perspective? If there is a merit to their finding, what have we done to 🇬🇧?? ...
4400	108270	@NightmareHolic @eretserus @elonmusk Human herd immunity is the only effective vaccine. It’s the only way this virus goes away for good. You can only create a vaccine for one strain of this thing at a time. I’d also love to see any evidence of any vaccine working against any previous coronavirus.
4401	111042	What’s in the injection?   It’s not a fragment of ‘coronavirus’ which can be treated.   It’s different from a vaccine in that instead of the immune system building immunity to the pathogen..the immune response is to create more of the pathogen if or when encountered again.
4402	112907	A photo Op that is laughable.  I hope I'm wrong, I'm usually not, but this vaccine could spread coronavirus to the point that it could make it worse. The reason I say this is because it mutates quickly.  Will still are so unsure about why it is so powerful and THAT

4406	201856	Great listen! The conversation around #vaccine scarcity and the TRIPS waiver was particularly eye-opening 😠#HumanRights #COVID19
4407	111782	Bullshit. I will take any vaccine with YEARS of development and science behind it. Thats actually a vaccine and not gene therapy. So I am #stillnottakingit cause these needle's are nit vaccines
4408	110016	what about the student teachers who are about to go back on their unpaid placement ? we get no ppe, can’t social distance and little support from universities ! do we get a priority vaccine ? #COVID19 #vaccine
4409	109380	This probably is not good. Vaccines seems still to be able to work but treatments for infections, less so.
4410	107734	"@margaritaevna95 How will the vaccine ""end"" the pandemic if people who have contracted COVID-19 are getting it again after being officially ""cured"" for weeks? This is a never-ending game we'll just have to accept as the REAL new normal after a certain point, that we can't stop it."
4411	111726	means testing the coronavirus vaccine, if you make 20k or less you get a tax refund worth 50 dollars if you get the vaccine and 5 dollars gets knocked off every 2.5k more you make until you get to 45k in which case you're on your own
4412	108325	"I don't think this is BREAKING, or even surprising.  @FDA has sold us all out to @pfizer.  It would be ""breaking"" if they DIDN'T allow some rushed to production poison with no safety data to be jabbed in american's arms for profit."

4425	109592	@TaurusLondono What it says is the coronavirus was in a bat population, they took that virus, recombined it with another virus for purpose of finding immunotherapy or a vaccine, but failed bc: 1. this new virus mutates too fast, and 2. it’s immune to practically everything. It was lab-created.
4426	108298	I am no anti vaxer but not interested in #COVID19 vaccine. PM said 3AW he would make it as mandatory as possible, the flu vaccine is not (not once had a shot &amp; never get the flu), why mandate covid? The vaccine is rushed &amp; would prefer to wait 12mths at least.How do others feel?

4467	107907	@LauraLynnTT @99freemind There is no vaccine for any coronavirus, but they will tell you they developed one for this China coronavirus in only 12 months record time &amp; tell you its safe, in spite of the fact it takes an average of 6 to 10 years of clinical trials before any vaccine can be determined safe.
4468	111094	This is awfully tempting, as vaccinating the kids is probably the difference between being comfortable taking them to see their grandparents at Christmas, and not.Really, I only hesitate because I doubt they could get a Canadian vaccine passport with American covid shots.
4469	107801	this is absurd. so a shot in the arm is the only way to survive?what in the F is going on? does no other medical treatment work?is COVID going to kill all because some do not have a vaccinethis is not science its madness
4470	108986	@DragonKing____ She’s the anti vaccine, anti mask, coronavirus is a hoax, who wants a coronavirus test?
4471	112458	@OliviaTroye The only Science they are believing in are those in the United States! Those they Pay! they do not believe in the science from any other Country! They meaning Democrats! I survived Covid-19 Not by vaccines but by Meds from my doctor! I believe him/her More then i believe the Gov!
4472	112107	@EliSeeney I’m immune deficient so when I get a flu shot it compromises my immune system because I can’t fight it off. The same would happen with a COVID-19 vaccine. I can’t take any antibiotics or the same thing will happen. Getting a COVID-19 is like signing my own death certificate
4473	112274	Neither do i..and no mask, test, or vaccine for me..and i am 67 yrs old. Still work n drive n shop..flu has not killed me and a hoax virus sure won't.
4474	111111	The Trump Admin really said the Coronavirus vaccine may not be affordable to everyone.   The reason: they needed private sector investment.  Fun fact: MOST vaccines are developed by the government or universities.  This is peak American Capitalism if I ever saw it.
4475	110651	The scientific irony lost on everyone is that the Wuhan-19 coronavirus vaccine does not provide immunity—and it does not even fall under the legal definition of vaccine... (think before you act)./Geo'sFinalQ.A.
4476	112522	i hate coronavirus bruh, it’s not compulsory with aged care and that’s literally what i’m in the middle of fucking studying. what happened to Australians rights this is stupiddd. the fucking vaccine hasn’t even been out for long enough to know if it’s gonna work properly 🤦🏽‍♀️

4484	112669	Not if they get the Delta variant, they can fool the vendors but they can't fool the virus. They pay $50 for a free vaccine. At risk is their life, a $5000 fine or 5 years in prison for every fake vaccine card.The stupidity is STRONG with these people.So does if really work?
4485	111536	Ugh, just asked this question to my BF last night. What if we think it’s over and we all go back to work and then it just starts up again? Do we need to stay quarantined until a cure/vaccine is found?
4486	111354	This is huge! If you are unvaccinated and were waiting for the #FDA  to approve the #CovidVaccine here it is! Get out there and get vaccinated!

4489	107872	@ConservativeHun @courier4Christ @benshapiro I really hope you are right, but there is no scientefic evidence suggesting Covid19 behaves similar to SARS or any other Virus. As far as I know It spreads until the vaccine comes or herd immunity occurs.

4503	110298	@GMB As the vaccine has not been proven to stop transmission of the virus this poll is like GMBtv irrelevant, the vaccine reduces effects of Covid-19 but you can still be asymptomatic &amp; still spread the virus, so those in the vulnerable category should probably take it,

4505	111679	It's really disappointing how large suburban Philly counties have been short changed on vaccines from the state. It's not because they're not using the shots they have- you can't get an appointment here. I've heard multiple people discussing travelling hours north to get shots.

4528	109236	@SharinStone @te6192 @RepThomasMassie No vaccine can provide 100% protection &amp; they fade just as the anti-bodies you get after catching Covid-19 fade.

4586	109612	@chris_lertora @CBSNews Since Vaccines still keep you from getting the virus, yes they are not 100%, they keep you from spreading the virus. Only if you get COVID-19 you spread it. Therefore vaccination keeps the spread down.
4587	112038	@Milhouse_Van_Ho They just didnt design the trials that way. What they did is pretty logic, they build the trial to find out if the vaccine would prevent covid19 (symptomatic infections). Remember that asymptomatic infections (not sick with covid) are only an issue if you infect someone at risk.
4588	110405	I had Covid-19 last year in November (5 days in the hospital). After that when the county I work for offered the Moderna vaccine. No issues just mild discomfort in the arm!
4589	108414	If China doesn't provide ample informations, the world will not find the vaccine. Therefore, the world has the right to conquer China and force them to stop eat exotic animals #Covid19
4590	108401	@KevinGillman Covid-19 may mutate, but it needs a nonimmune host... Once a reliable vaccine is widely distributed, it may be rare...
4591	109165	@SonamVe62252893 @DrRPNishank @HRDMinistry @narendramodi @AmitShah I hope you know that favipiravir drug will be out soon. Do you think they will postpone mains and neet??Well,I support postponing the exam.....because it is just a drug but not a vaccine to covid-19 #postponejee #postponeneet
4592	107804	This knowing that the vaccine isn't approved for all age groups.They don't want face-to-fact instruction to resume, so they're throwing every roadblock they can to prevent it.
4593	108358	Fascinating. All the (depressing) things about viruses most of us never knew (eg no vaccine for AIDS so perhaps none for COVID-19). Looks like home working is forever (5G we need you right now).
4594	108877	@Mc_Phils 40 years No #vaccine for #HIV100 years No #vaccine for #CancerOn going research no #Vaccine for #commonCold 1 year #Covid19   #Vaccine💊✅.      ❌And you want me to take that shit Hell No!!!
4595	108355	I only had a small temperature from my #COVID19 vaccine yesterday. I am completely fine today. I will still be keeping my distance and be wearing my mask in crowded and indoor environments.
4596	108703	@CatalinJ15 @MotherNatureNet @JustinTrudeau Maybe or it could be a one off like the Polio and Measles/Mumps/Rubella vaccines.Right now we've no idea. The vast majority of humanity have neither the access nor the dosh to get an annual flu vaccine. #COVID19
4597	109793	Bill Gates wants a third synthetic vaccine, synthetic beef, and synthetic energy just this week.Bill Gates is a monster.
4598	112153	Institute a federal mandate. Keep it in place until scientists determine we’ve reached the threshold. Require you to have a vaccine card to participate in society. People are stupid and must be told what to do sometimes
4599	107761	@SABCNews I took it for 2 reasons : 1) If I get covid19 I hope the vaccine prevents me from landing in hospital and going on a ventilator. I have diabetes and hypertension.  2) I want to protect my family and friends in anyway I can from getting sick
4600	108149	@bopinion 4 Things, The Wuhan Virus is decreasing in strength, We Are Becoming Immune-building Antibodies, Testing Is Massive, If You Get “Flu” Vaccines- you will come up positive when tested for COVID-19
4601	108500	@GovRonDeSantis When will officials like yourself realize that the COVID-19 fast-tracked vaccine is a Trojan horse. It's not meant to heal!! It is meant to harm! Ask the vaccine creators themselves if they and their families have taken it. I think you will find that they have not. 🤔
4602	111920	@DavidWh22347920 @jkenney Easy answer to that. Max Vaccination and herd immunity only works when the pathogen is slow spreading. In the case if Covid-19 it spreads and mutates so fast in the antivaxxers that there is a HUGE possibility for a moron to be a new patient 0 for a virus that skirts the vaccine.
4603	112023	Now’s a good time to start talking to the older people in your life and make sure they have all the info so they feel comfortable w/ getting the vaccine! For example: my grandpa said he felt like he’s made it this long so he probs doesn’t need it, and we’re working on that!
4604	110154	News not given by party for good deeds.If you do good things media makes the news. Hope you understand @ArvindKejriwal #AndhraPradesh #COVID19Vaccine Well done @YSRCParty @ysjagan 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
4605	109581	@jason_bane FACT - Covid-19 is in the human pop. 4 good, fast or slowFACT - mask wearing only slows it down; it can't stop itFACT - herd immunity doesn't mean that no one will ever catch it again, it just reduces the likelihoodFACT - there has NEVER been a vaccine for a coronavirus. EVER.
4606	111357	@ilysheezy it’s actually bc the site over there in Wuhan (?) had put in a request for funding to try and put coronavirus in bats, in an attempt to create a super vaccine. They got declined for funding obv and then miraculously covid spread bc someone “ate a bat” like a year or so later lol
4607	109327	Why is @GregAbbott_TX getting the vaccine before front line workers and the elderly? He needs to wait like the rest of us. He’s been openly killing us since #COVID started. If we’re still alive in 2022 we need to vote him out. #AbbottFailedTexas #TexasDeservesBetter #TexasCovid
4608	109594	@WordOfNadja @benhabib6 Interesting! I knew Sweden led many countries in health care. Individualism is quite prevalent in America, but has its pluses and minuses, particularly when individuals are wrong but believe they are right, such as those refusing to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. Questioning is a 1/
4609	111006	Looking to interview someone with mental illness who has struggled with isolation in the past year, or for whom the Covid-19 vaccine is a beacon of hope, about their experience.This is for an article on mental illness &amp; vaccine eligibility. I can keep you anonymous. DM me!
4610	202328	Happy day ❣️ Got my 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine 😊 I'm so thankful I was able to receive in a relatively very short period of time 💕 Hope this pandemic will ends soon 🙏😷#vaccinated @WHO https://t.co/e5BbYgAyND
4611	112379	@globalnews If vaccines actually prevent infection and retransmission, then it is one thing.  But if they do not, then what is the passport indicating?  The bearer will not get too sick, or die of Covid19?  Covid19 is not the biggest killer in this world.  Other sicknesses can be serious too
4612	202019	I was fortunate to receive the first dose of the #COVID19 Moderna vaccine yesterday. My heart is full + I am so grateful for science. ♥️🦠 https://t.co/xygC6BnGsF
4613	202374	Doubled jabbed as of yesterday. Like last time, only side effects are sore arm &amp; feeling tired (went to bed at 20.30 last night!). Feel much better this morning, although who wouldn't feel good after 10 hours sleep 😆 #COVID19 #CovidVaccine
4614	108858	@edusanchez19us @realDonaldTrump @GOPLeader @senatemajldr So stupid. The Chinese Weaponized Coronavirus Spreads. People get infected. That's going to keep happening until we reach herd immunity throughout the USA or there is rapid treatments &amp; working vaccines. There is no stopping the Chinese bioweapon. You can only delay infections.
4615	112505	@SHEsus__Christ They actually working on a HIV vaccine right now it will work like crap you take the vaccine every six months and it will be based on the same type of technology that got us the covid-19 vaccine
4616	110557	THRILLED TO ANNOUNCE that you will not be participating in my life if you do not get a vaccine. #CommonSenseNotNonsense
4617	112235	So question If someone has contracted covid19 previously is there a need to wait any specific time period before taking the vaccine?
4618	112691	I sometimes wonder if the leavers types are scared of the coronavirus vaccine because they think it’ll make them become a rejoiner :)
4619	108626	Don’t believe him? Well then he will show all of you he’s fine on national television. Just like he did with showing that the vaccines and treatments work for coronavirus
4620	108729	I'm not anti-vaccine, but can I have some faith in my immune system until I see if my friends grow any extra limbs in the next year or two? #Covid19
4621	112487	It’s possible already to get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccine on CVS app but literary on MA there is no way to get any appointment. total dissapointment
4622	111411	There were several mutations before Delta emerged and it won't be long until it mutates to a strain the vaccine doesn't protect against.
4623	109702	Simply, getting #COVID19 vaccines is like to train dogs (your immune response) to defense thieves (virus) in the yard. They are NOT well-trained, may bite the virus, or may bite you or may drool over the virus
4624	109993	I can’t wait, in ten years my late night tv will have “do you or someone you know take the Covid-19 vaccine?  You may be entitled to compensation.” Commercials everywhere
4625	107861	@AndrewHolnessJM Question: is it true that the vaccine doesn't prevent the coronavirus? (If that's the case, what would be the purpose of taking it then.)
4626	110217	*Is this what the testing is about, do they want to identify those who haven't received a flu vaccine? *Dr. Rashid Buttar says everyone who has had a flu vaccine the last 10 years would likely test positive for the Coronavirus, which they will use to further the police state!
4627	110095	Twitter is telling me : don't look. I don't know if it is legit, but I need to give it a shot myself to judge if yes or no. And keep using my brain, common sense and researches instead of letting the medias tell me how I should think and what I should believe. #COVID19 #vaccine
4628	109596	@TribeJefferson @citizenwillis @gtconway3d Oh no, these aren't 'rallies'!They're official Whitehouse press briefings.Or maybe an official Coronavirus task force briefing.Or maybe an Operation Warp Speed vaccine briefing.Or wait, maybe I'll sign some executive orders kind of meeting.They'll figure it out as he goes.
4629	109471	@TsarNichII Agreed govt always kills more people. But in the history of vaccines and illness, there's never been a human vaccine for a coronavirus, but now is the time? You're right it's non-zero, but extremely close to zero.
4630	111233	@CindyKendrick11 Vaccines against the related coronaviruses that cause SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have worked in animal models only. There has not yet ever been a successful coronavirus vaccine.
4631	112030	@Danada54 @ProudSocialist @SymbioticWrld That is indeed a very concerning point, but it's not an easy one to digest for the mass-public.  Completely changing the economic system is much needed, and humanity is running out of time.   60% of all staff workers don't even want to take the Covid-19 vaccine here in CA, so...
4632	109309	This is despicable. at this point I am starting to believe they’re using the pandemic as a form of population control/eugenics the way they keep promoting the COVID hoax to their constituents but are first in line for the vaccine&amp; making sure they have health insurance.
4633	202303	Jacqueline Alpeter posted in June a photo of herself with these words around it: “I’m not having the vaccine. My body, My choice.” In May she posted a photo of herself and the words “I trust my immune system not an experimental vaccine. My DNA, My Choice.” https://t.co/xLIkF7JxJe
4634	110685	@Cryptof69260077 @genesimmons I found out last week that we’ve been working on this vaccine since SARS and swine flu, they’re coronavirus too. It’s been a while since we’ve been working on it so it’s not as rushed as we think.
4635	109168	Don’t agree with this to be honest. Genuinely don’t care how much it costs or who profits from it, just get the vaccine created, scaled up, distributed and prescribed ASAP so we can all see our family &amp; friends again and stop thousands more deaths.
4636	112098	@CBCAlerts If herd immunity doesn't work, then a vaccine won't work, and we might as well open up now. Immunity to coronavirus being shortlived would basically be the end of any hope of controlling it.
4637	108460	This really would explain everything... and would mean we need to adjust the research needed to make a vaccine... ASAP.
4638	111539	#COVID19 testing and vaccine information + health promotion has to be culturally-sensitive and community specific.I keep seeing vaccine comms. suggesting “get the first vaccine you are offered”. HOW does this address the hesitancies or mistrust amongst people? #ONpoli
4639	202393	@tomselliott @ezralevant So if I got my initial shot two days ago, the booster will be due on the 8 month anniversary of desperate Afghans falling out of the sky from American military aircraft.  #Afghanistan #COVID19 #Talibans
4640	109170	@DrEricDing I doubt I will forget my 2nd COVID-19 vaccine dose if I can get the first one. Maybe I'll download the app later as a goodluck talisman.
4641	201868	Got my letter through I'm getting vaccinated in Methill??? Do I need a jab to go to Methill before getting the jab in Methill?? #coronavirus
4642	111305	@pfizer @PfizerCA can you please comment on this. This is very concerning if our Provincial Health officer is planning to not follow the proper dosing schedule here in BC for your vaccine.@CPHO_Canada may need to step in on this.#bcpoli #covid19bc #COVID19Canada
4643	109065	People not understanding that 90 ≠ 100 and trying to use one offs as proof the vaccine doesn’t work are annoying af. I’ll take my chances with the 90% and y’all can play around with the 0% effectiveness of having NO vaccine all you want
4644	108752	In all likelihood @realDonaldTrump will do exactly the same with a vaccine if developed in USA. Only hope is that developer is outside US. But @nadhimzahawi is the kind of politician that will allow poisonous slimy chlorinated chicken in to Britain because it offers - death!!
4645	108733	As expected, very welcome news. People with compromised immune systems may not mount an adequate immune response to vaccination. @CBSEveningNews @CBSThisMorning @FaceTheNation @CBSSunday @60Minutes #Covid_19 #immunocompromised #vaccine
4646	111089	Christ. This is if people actually follow the guidelines.On the plus side; new job in Feb, guy I'm replacing has done very little due to Covid, thought we'd have a ton to do then as Vaccine will be start improving things. Looks like an easy couple of months for me...
4647	107711	You're not having the Covid-19 vaccine? Good, more for me then.I've been inoculated against the 'rona 25 times and there's nothing you can do to stop me.
4648	107803	Who cares if people get sick with coronavirus? You'll likely recover &amp; have antibodies in your system. But no...Big Pharma doesn't want you to develop immunity naturally. They want you to pay for a vaccine...so that you develop immunity (when you could have for free).
4649	111087	@CDCgov hi, I am wondering, with the vaccine coming soon, will people need to be tested for covid-19 before being vaccinated? Do we know what can happen if one is asymptomatic and get the vaccine?I think the possibility of this to happen is very high.
4650	111102	@bencorke @Keith99352796 @UxbEconomist07 They never claimed it did. You made that up. It reduced the effects and hospitalizations of covid. Then idiots like you refused and made it worse. You do know with been research coronavirus vaccines since the 80s? This wasn't the 1st covid. It was coronavirus ID-19.
4651	109541	Gates is an admitted eugenicist and wants to force you and your families to have a coronavirus vaccine. 👇
4652	111730	@stuartflatt There has never been a successful coronavirus vaccine. I don’t think we’ll ever get one.
4653	202047	Big Bird rules. My wife and I got our boosters a week ago today and my ten-year-old niece is getting her first one tomorrow and we couldn't be prouder.
4654	202041	I can feel my Pfizer #COVID19 vaccine working. The increasing loss of autonomy as the government takes greater and greater control of my thoughts and movements through the implanted chip.  1/2
4655	108014	NO cuz there’ll be NO vaccine for this coronavirus becuz it mutates &amp; there over 10 strains. Canadians have been infected by different strains cuz it is mutating. Hence NO virus will be found like our regular flues - too many strains!! One shot - no guarantee its the right strain
4656	109698	The best birthday gift I am receiving this year is confirmation I will be receiving the COVID-19 vaccine on my birthday! Such a relief ✅
4657	110924	"🥺 It just hurt my heart to be referred to as a ""communist dictator"" by a friend I've known since middle school b/c I advocate for the Covid-19 vaccine 🥺 I just want people to live. Even the ones I don't like."

4660	109942	@KeithOlbermann Three points:1) Vaccines don’t protect against infection, but against disease2) Because of 1: Covid-19 will never go away…it will become endemic like all previous respiratory viruses3) Because of 1 + 2: Measures to restrict spread serve no logical purpose
4661	201880	@DrennanEdward I’m not sure but I know my life insurance covers anything COVID-19 related, including vaccines. I’m not going near the job though! I just got off the phone with them A short while ago and I will be having Hardcopy confirmation emailed to me.
4662	108795	@Talcen @NexusFolf @SmellyStrobes @Marks_Barks @KissMeKarma @BetaEtaDelota @JTwusky @Little_Fenn @Pherric @punkwolf85 @DustinDoggo Nice!  This video shows you my experience on getting the #Covid #vaccine and how it is starting to change my life for the good (open up the world again)!  Check it out!https://t.co/041bk8wotXEnjoy!#covid19 #vaccine #pandemic #coronavirus #covid
4663	112231	How long will it take for the 16% to reach 100%? Is the recent boost in vaccinations enough? Although we still don’t have enough vaccine supplies to begin with…
4664	110596	@MuffinTimeYay @ChrisMcK2018 @SkyNews @AlokSharma_RDG The common cold is a coronavirus and no vaccine has ever been found ... in fact no vaccine has been found for a Coronovirus strain
4665	112425	If you have the vaccine you can still get the virus and spread it. No vaccine has been shown to fully stop the spread.
4666	107890	Preparation would seem like a good idea to roll out vaccines for younger kids ASAP once approved. @SaskHealth @SKGov @MerrimanPaul @Carla4Lakeview @ not on Twitter Dustin Duncan
4667	109041	"@KING5Seattle Of course they do. That's what this is all about. Follow the money. Not complicated to understand. Hell, the NIH signed a contract with Moderna in Dec. 2019 before the ""plandemic"" to secure rights to any coronavirus vaccine that they may develop. Look it up."
4668	110001	There seem to some serious issues with the vaccine roll-out. The first people getting the vaccine are not emergency responders but ANYONE in gov't. This is happening locally for me as well. Not enough talk about this.
4669	109086	@RottenInDenmark came out in the news that Getting Covid19 can cause ED that does not go away after you recover from Covid19 so get that news out there it seems like it would be really good incentive especially for those who mistakenly think that getting the vaccine would emasculate them.
4670	112643	IMPORTANT- Been waiting time see something like this. It’s a schematic outlining how the #COVID19 #vaccine might be distributed when there is not enough (or who is considered first priority etc) 👇
4671	112008	If every country can use crash test dummies to save lives, then why don’t the creators of the three different Covid-19 vaccine share it too? It doesn’t make sense that we don’t have enough vaccines for the entire world. Work together, make a difference, and open the world. ❤️
4672	108872	Trump's promising everyone will start getting two doses of a coronavirus vaccine for free in Jan.If he loses the election, do you think he's going to keep his promise?
4673	108971	I.m not going to be happy until I get the algorithms attention. 5G  coronavirus plandemic Bill Gates vaccine
4674	202425	Got the COVID-19 vaccine at work today. I work with an extremely vulnerable population, so I am happy that I can continue to protect them by taking the vaccine. Feeling pretty hopefully after getting it too. 💉 https://t.co/tZKcpqwQJB
4675	108473	@sajidjavid We've followed the rules, took all the jabs put in front of us, but when will we be free from restrictions and coronavirus Act???!! Is the coronavirus act being renewed in march or will it be the end of?

4677	111081	A Ray of hope in these rather bleak times! We need to leverage our manufacturing prowess to the hilt, get cracking ASAP! We don’t ‘want’ the vaccines, we ‘need’ the vaccines!
4678	202387	@AshleyGunstock Just to say today was my first volunteer shift with the covid-19 vaccine program at a 100% independent pharmacy (which is also a post office and normally a news agent) and that they are doing a fantastic job and saving lives far and wide.
4679	108638	Question: If an unvaxxed person contracts covid-19 then beats it and fully recovers. Why would they need to be vaccinated? They have already had it, wouldn't it mean they are immune to it now? Just curious &amp; im fully vaxxed btw.
4680	109426	@reviewjournal Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
4681	201900	Uwe gets boostered today #jab #COVID19 and now that we started action once I'm going to get my #flu jab, too.🤔🤭I'll have coloured vision all weekend long even while watching b/w event cinema 🙂🤫
4682	202397	Just had my first Covid-19 vaccination jab at a busy Barmulloch Community Centre in North Glasgow. @NHSScotland doing a great job!
4683	112515	If contracting, falling ill, surviving, and recovering apparently don’t give you immunity to the virus, then why is there a vaccine even being talked about... also, can anyone who wants that “vaccine” just take a bullet to the dome instead and quit wasting everyone’s time
4684	111983	Quite amusing to see #antivaxers having the #COVID19 #CovidVaccine and the excuses they give for why they’ve had it! 😂👍💉
4685	112822	Will the US Covid vaccine be free of charge, too?   If we are really serious about mitigating this virus, I would hope so.
4686	109315	@FergalBowers @rte Hey Sherlock As you claim to be an journalist why aren’t all the poor countries that have no vaccine or only 5% vaccinated not dying in the millions ?Are they immune to #COVID19 Or is it just an western disease 🦠
4687	110679	@Bald_Eagle_2 @Unity_Coach And we dont even know long term effects. Theoretically if it gave people Alzheimer's or is ischemic lesions or autoimmune or cancers we might know in 2 years. Coronavirus vaccine animal trial history is fascinating
4688	110589	Well, Holy Pf*ck. The state of NM has decided that I *am* vaccine worthy … Pfizer, in my case. Must be a computer error cause the code works and all, but looks like I get shot tomorrow. #COVID19
4689	111653	My question, to folks, that encouraging others, to take vaccines, for COVID-19. Say, the person listen, to you and get vaccinated, and after get COVID-19 and die or the person die from vaccine, without having COVID-19.  What would you say, to their love ones? Opinion
4690	110837	I love this @ChrisCuomo. It's absolutely no sense. Everyone should ask him/herself why we don't see cases of Polio, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Tetanus, Varicella. It's because we have vaccines. Please, get ready to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Together we gonna win. Vaccines work.
4691	112103	@SkyNews The proclivity for rapid mutation by RNA viruses has been known for decades. When the 1st #COVID19  mutations appeared targeted to the Spike protein why were vaccine developments not reoriented to contain additional virus antigens? This is not hindsight it's learning from history
4692	108439	I have zero sympathy for any adults in the US getting Covid-19 and who passed on getting the vaccine. They should have to pay out-of-pocket for their own medical care. If people want to be stupid, let it be on their own dime.
4693	110179	@RealBasedMAGA @LVNancy 1. Flu has a vaccine that doesn't eradicate the virus, returns annually.2. Cancer doesn't have a vaccine. Years of study and $90+ billion spent.3. COVID-19 has a vaccine in testing, COVID-19 has only been around for a few months.It's like COVID-19 is a miracle.
4694	109280	WAHH MODIJI WAHHWhat a partiality is going on in this country!!!!!! CBSE students are students and they are the future of this country and they can suffer from Covid-19, but the SSC students are Not students they are vaccine of Covid-19 there is no worries for there families.
4695	202222	I’ve just had my COVID-19 vaccine. Anyone who refuses need to look in the mirror and think of their families at their funeral..So far no sign of Bill Gates, I’ve not turned Gay, I’ve no desire to kill and am not at imminent risk of death. Do yourself a favour. Get the jab
4696	108954	Thankfully, I was able to get my booster, get my flu shot, and I am wearing my mask. Only plan to see a small handful of people who believe in these things too. ❤️
4697	108829	@NikolovScience @KassandraKitson One must ask,  why would Fauci fund millions to a chinese lab for gain of function testing on CoronaVirus......while also funding vaccine research for those same Coronaviruses.  Especially when he's the lead guy in the US for a pandemic response.    Odd no???
4698	112401	Wokeninams don't care about the price. Even if they are cheaper (heck even if Sinovac will just give them for free), as long as they're from China, their sinophobia won't stop tingling until they persuade the public that the Chinese vaccine is some kind of biochemical weapon. 🤷‍♂️
4699	109837	So, I got a message from my doctors the other day about making an appointment to get the Covid-19 vaccine. Unfortunately, I've done my homework &amp; I want the J&amp;J shot. The 1 shot my doctors DON'T have access 2. Shouldn't ppl b able 2 choose which shot they get w/o having 2 travel?
4700	108726	Suspect Trump does not care if a coronavirus vaccine is effective or just crap. Just needs the announcement before Nov! #TrumpPandemic

4703	110752	It is certain that Covid19 virus will became a permanent resident of this planet. It will definitely keep changing its character. In the meantime,humans will argue about vaccines,behave badly with each other,create crowds,poor countries will suffer,lockdowns will create problems
4704	112797	@Newsweek He will go away long before coronavirus.  Too bad no one is working on a vaccine for Trumpism though.  #TrumpVirusCatastrophe #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
4705	202249	To all the anti vaxxers, I was given my first vaccine dose yesterday, how long now until my DNA mutates and I start looking like Bill Gates? 😂😂#COVID19 #CovidVaccine
4706	108505	@SpankHorton What do you mean by “during the vaccination process?” You can’t predict whether a variant will happen or not and if it does happen, if it will breakthrough a vaccine. We’re in Omicron. That’s the 15th variant. Publicly available information.
4707	112915	@hungryjesse @afneil This whole right wing obsession with Sweden's Covid-19 stategy is clickbait. This unscientific belief that herd immunity is a viable option, when it's just natural selection. No viral herd immunity has ever been achieved without the use of an effective vaccine.
4708	112358	@JustinPulitzer I’m not saying to keep the economy shut down till a vaccine is approved. But no one has made a plan to social distance while opening the economy. If you open it up and say it’s open, people are going to think it’s over. Go back to what they were doing before they heard of COVID19
4709	110974	This is great news even if it’s still too far off - kids need vaccines yesterday. School has started in most places.
4710	107692	"@JohnCornyn I don't get why ppl think having 380k ppl test positive for a novel coronavirus is ""okay.""Hypothetically - if no one died but it still spread like this and ppl began having the actual disease and we're sick for days or weeks at a time with no vaccine or know who's infected"
4711	202091	this shall serve as my official request for my newsroom/all newsrooms to henceforth refer to the vaccine, exclusively, as “Fauci Ouchie”....hearing no objections, the resolution is adopted *bangs gavel*
4712	109234	I miss Wi Spa so much and it’s the first place I’m going after immunity from the vaccine has kicked in. If the place survives. Ugh.
4713	202097	This time last year I had COVID-19 and today I had my first vaccine, what an action packed trip around the sun this has been
4714	110934	Here comes the propaganda...did you think they'd release a vaccine and the world would go back to normal?  Nope, the DNC Mouthpiece is here to let you all know, you will be controlled like sheep...take the vaccine and use a mask, two ineffective measures
4715	109659	If hydroxy chloroquine is effective against #COVID19 Would the funding dry up? Would the Gates Foundation &amp; their ties to #Fauci be severed? Why doesn't media ask #Fauci if he and his friends have a vested interest in finding an expensive vaccine vs a generic treatment? #OAN
4716	109806	@Jo19291031 @ToniParsons14 @Anna98831 @ProfTerryHughes @GeraldKutney the coronavirus exists because of climate change and human consumption. Viruses are fuses for overpopulation. New viruses form when normally separate species are forced to share resources, like after a wildfire. Next pandemic is coming from south america. Vaccines or prevention?
4717	111892	Our immune systems protect us here thanks. I’ll let someone have my jab who really needs it. #coronavirus #VACCINE
4718	109966	@WSJ @WSJopinion @gerardtbaker How do you think the globalists got a huge supply of miracle vaccines in short order. They money laundered through Afghanistan. Then they created a coronavirus pandemic. Our benefactors are psychopaths.
4719	111824	@MusubiBrand @theflowernurse @LarouxVandyk Now if someone would develop an actual vaccine for a coronavirus, we’d be in business. But after decades of trying , no one yet has been able to do it.
4720	108511	This👇🏻 is the pivotal moment the US loses its hegemony. For the world to see, global organizations and other countries are presenting a pandemic response that the US has bungled. Also, the power of price setting: how can a vaccine now costs $30, $300,... in the US?
4721	109756	@jamesmatesitv The #Covid19 problem in Europe has NOTHING to do with #CovidVaccines as they make no difference and may do harm.How people hang on to convenient myths!The solution is herd immunity. Which, like Sweden, is now happening in the UK.I know what I'm talking about.
4722	107914	Israel: Pfizer's mRNA vaccine is only 64% effective in preventing coronavirus infection after two doses, compared to 94% in May. In addition, the researchers warn that it is too early to say how effective the vaccine is to prevent hospitalization.
4723	112093	@sunlorrie you want to know why there is vaccine hesitancy. Because it’s all a damn lie .. the government obviously has not one clue about science so why would anyone in their right mind go get it. It comes with no relief of the tyranny so obviously it does not work
4724	107941	and when the virus mutates, will there be booster shots and will they all have nano technology/ chips in them as well?so quickly done to...ALMOST AS IF THEY ALREADY HAD IN IN STOCK AND JUST NEEDED TO ROLE IT OUTTO THE BEGGING DESPERATE WESTERN WORLD
4725	112028	If the Coronavirus is a virus and the pharmaceutical companies can come up with a vaccine for it, can they come up with a vaccine to the AIDs virus and give it to kids before they start elementary school and give it to all of the adults in the U.S. too??!!
4726	110193	"In my latest article for @Tech_Networks, I've asked the question ""Why do some vaccines last a lifetime?"" 🤔Why are COVID-19 vaccines seasonal, but the measles shot lasts forever?💉The secret is in my article below 👇#scicomm #CovidVaccine #COVID19 #science"
4727	108589	"2020: ""There's no way we can safely get a vaccine out in a year""2021: ""We rushed 3 vaccines out in less than a year, pick one, they are all safe."""
4728	202289	Just booked my vaccination appointment! I think I was never so happy before that employment at the University puts me into the category of teachers :) but feeling a little bad that my parents are lined up after me!#COVID19 #vaccine
4729	111576	@nytimes NYT heard:”The number of people saying they are now likely or certain to get the coronavirus vaccine in the U.S. has grown. Polls show that skepticism is melting, partly because of the images of people getting the shot.This is truly heard immunity.” #headlinedefined
4730	109755	I don’t want the coronavirus vaccine because the government is putting microchips in them to track me, a clearly important person somehow, getting high off my ass and shoving fistfuls of potato chips into my gullet while watching the Simpsons 😔
4731	108767	@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo Please can you do something about our criminal government here in UK. The way in which they're treating us like guinea pigs with an experimental vaccine is like things you read about during WWII. They will seriously end up harming the population.🙏🏻
4732	110524	A worthy read about the problems with our current testing system and how that will play out as the vaccine is rolled out.
4733	110268	6 out of 7000000 had clots. How are they sure na yung vaccine ang cause? Same with AZ. ????? I dont get it, why would they delay the rollout for this very very very very rare instances (that may or may not even be related to the vaccine).
4734	111917	@dirtydiscooo I just had Covid-19 a few weeks ago and I'm not getting the vaccine. I'm also diabetic. Still not afraid. I survived it and I will continue to live life without fear. Never give up, never surrender.
4735	108611	Well darn! Just when we thought it was safe, hahaha, lol, Get the jab they say and everything will go back to normal, yea right! No to the VAX has been preached for awhile and NOW you know WHY!
4736	110932	@thehill Why are employers sacking the un-vaxxed - and businesses ban them - the vaxxed can still get Covid-19 and still spread it to others - are equally infectious - so there is no protection of staff or customers ??? Can any employer or manager or MP explain this ???
4737	107687	Right cos so many people have “common sense”? Where has he been the past 4 years? Anyway, nobody better come near me unmasked unless I say otherwise. Im not trying to test the efficacy of my vaccine with my health problems. This so called doctor is going to get people killed
4738	108682	@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump They will take away all your credit on the Vaccines innovation and the fast work you put in for extensive testing. No other country in the World has such an extensive COVID-19 testing.
4739	109031	@CNN @andersoncooper @drsanjaygupta Given how devastating this pandemic is, should we consider an “in-vivo vaccine, where we purposely expose healthy people to a coronavirus positive individual for a brief period, in order to give them a mild viral load, in hopes they will mount an immune response and avoid serious
4740	109098	So, if not taken urgent steps to infuse resources, the #COVID19 vaccine may be a rich country commodity. Uneven spread of the vaccine may not be a good idea either. A porous wall is a little or no protection.
4741	202125	Got the first @pfizer dose today. Looking forwards to streaming those dreams in 4kUHD tonight. #5G #vaccine #COVID19
4742	110300	@NHSEngland How can a person cancel a coronavirus vaccine booked centrally for in a couple weeks time (because they just got the vaccine yesterday through the local GP) ?
4743	111178	@BorisJohnson Every nation is doing everything wrong in this Coronavirus crisis you don't open your economy when the virus is everywhere worldwide! None of the world leaders are only think of money in their economies! Every nation keep everyone in lockdown until a vaccine comes!
4744	112059	getting a covid-19 vaccine should be a law. you don't want it? then go to prison. no, you can't pay. it's unbailable. the only way to get out is to get the shot or rot in jail.
4745	110608	Know a climber or outdoor person who thinks they don't need the COVID-19 vaccine? This one is for them -
4746	109971	"Fuck this stupid country. A private clinic is offering Covid-19 vaccines to 30+ year olds but it looks like they are just in it to rip off the local counties that actually budget and provide universal healthcare but for political reasons get billed when private clinics ""help""."
4747	109130	The superspreaders of the Coronavirus get the vaccine first after calling the Coronavirus a hoax &amp; brainwashing others into believing it, then spreading the Coronavirus, causing over 280,000 innocent people to die. 🙄
4748	110423	Yes, sorry but l agree with this! my country(Thailand) dont have any news about vaccines but in country l live (Luxembourg) vaccines is come in the january next year.
4749	107832	What a load of 💩 ...no way will I ever get this vaccine, 🙄 or any others for that matter! The 3 stooges will be first in line...😂😂😂
4750	110207	"@wicklundc0512_w @DanoIdam @PaulKing_77 @Breaking911 ""Clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines have been taking place since summer 2020""Meaning you are currently in one giant trial. You are the guinea pig. Clinical trials usually take YEARS to complete. If you still don't get it, do yourself a favor, definitely get the vaccine."
4751	111749	@tevapharmeurope   I Never believe you be sick of those sicknesses like covid 19 coronavirus that need immune system trigger and bovine colostrum supplement can't respond. It is a workable solution in my opinion. You know they are stronger than influenza vaccine? natural G-d sent
4752	111045	Seems the only answer to Covid-19 that the establishment will accept is a Bill Gates vaccine. We all know why.
4753	109034	It’s gotta happen then. Herd immunity, I’ll protect the elderly in my family but I’ll risk me being out an about because most of us need to get immune to this we can’t go on like this till there is a vaccine #StupidThinking we can.
4754	108259	Anyone else find it sketch the Monday after they announce president they just happened to find a coronavirus vaccine 🤔
4755	110356	@sweetness4713 @Pinchy63 @l_stone @globeandmail Then how come OTHER provinces are already set up for COVID-19 vaccine registration, while Ontario has to wait another 3 weeks? Ford doesn't get a bye for this one, sorry!
4756	110263	@lizoluwi @johnlittle Unlike countries where #COVID19 is rife, we can easily afford to wait until a reliable effective vaccine is available. I just do not understand why people are in such a mad rush to take something sub standard🙄🙄
4757	109133	Oxford #covid19 Vaccine:“Which is to say, all vaccinated animals were infected. What to make of this data? It is crystal clear that the vaccine did not provide sterilizing immunity to the virus challenge, the gold standard for any vaccine. It may provide partial protection.”
4758	108068	Got my first #coronavirus #vaccine by #moderna I am still going to wear a mask until Ontario County, #NY or #NewYork reaches herd immunity.
4759	110725	they saying in order for the coronavirus curb to flatten 70 percent of us gotta catch it to build immunity from it cuz it’s still no vaccine. 🤦🏾‍♂️
4760	110120	#CoronavirusPandemic @AP @cspan @USATODAY @WSJbusiness @business @nytimes Is there no vaccine for coronavirus?

4762	201837	Looking at this queue, I think I'd take my chances with #COVID19 than the #COVID19Vaccine @Khairykj #TrustNoOne
4763	202141	One day has passed since the coronavirus vaccine was given. I still feel uncomfortable with the injected arm and slightly hot. However, getting pretty well ...？ I can move！
4764	108867	@WAVY_News And it COULD also be just another variant they're collecting to develop next year's iteration of the vaccine. My god! STOP IT.The obiden administration is collecting 25k samples (per wk?) for DNA sequencing in preparation for next year's flu/coronavirus.Don't go hysterical.
4765	108949	Y la vacuna Rusa? Solo Argentina... And  the Russian vaccine? Not even Mexico uses it. Only in Argentina.
4766	112578	By allowing places to charge for aspects of administering the vaccine, you make the guarantee of it being free everywhere less believable. I know most places aren’t charging, but if people had to pay to get tested, why WOULDN’T they think they’d need to pay to get the vaccine?
4767	110871	This is serious for the US. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are hard to produce; quantities are limited. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine needs a new Phase III trial. Now this one has to restart its trial, too. If the J&amp;J vaccine hits a snag, there’s not enough.
4768	109606	Before the bad takes ramp up: this is the only vaccine that won't need freezer-A necessary option for regions without access to tech. And very good to see
4769	109239	Ex-CDC Director on the news: “We may never get a vaccine. There are viruses like HIV that scientists have been working on for decades with no success”My mom: “Oh what the fuck if it’s that hard forget it just give me the fucking virus” #COVID19
4770	110630	@MVYRD @mikefarb1 How would you have COVID-19 antibodies if you haven’t had this virus (we hope) and there is no vaccine?
4771	111346	If there is anything Covid '19 and the subject on it's vaccine have done, it is to demystifying most of y'all favourite Pastors for their ignorance, misinformed nature and fraud they're.
4772	109670	Best wishes to POTUS @realDonaldTrump  and First Lady @MELANIATRUMP my prayers are with you.  My advice to recover from Coronavirus is drink some hot tea.  That is really all you need to get rid of the virus.  A cup of tea ☕ is the real vaccine.
4773	110969	Every single person is eligible for the vaccine. The fact that our government has had 9 months to plan a rollout and is fumbling this bad is.... not surprising tbh
4774	112398	@ReasonVsFear If humans are this stupid, I don't WANT to be one. Just sayin'.🤨#Covid19 #vaccines #vaxup
4775	109143	@WFKARS @PapaMojoJoeJoe Unvaccinated folks with no valid, specific MEDICAL excuse for not getting vaccines need to start paying constant daily penalties until they man-up/woman-up and get their shots. Otherwise, America's Covid-19 pandemic, which should have ended months ago, will drag on for years.
4776	109505	@Q13FOX BUT what is her vaccine record? Any flu shots in the last year? Then she will give a false positive for coronavirus. There’s coronavirus in the flu shots of the last two years.
4777	108127	I think everyone complaints a lot about #holidays That's why #coronavirus is still here so that no one can complaint to god about #festivalholidays are on #weekendsWe need to stop complaining for everything.Otherwise we can see the resultsHopefully we get #coronavaccine soon
4778	111106	May people don’t care.They’re terrified.They won’t relax until everybody gets the vaccine.THEN everything can open back up.
4779	110676	#GreysAnatomy - I am glad Deluca told Richard to make a decision about Meredith getting into the clinical trial for the COVID-19 vaccine. Meredith is getting worse with all the shivering
4780	110348	We don’t need masks. We don’t need to quarantine. We don’t need social distancing. We don’t need a vaccine! We don’t need to live in fear! We DO NEED to speak up and defend our freedom! Fight for it America...or we will lose it!
4781	110151	Well who ever hears of COVID 19 crippling China, theories re they have a vaccine and refuse to share it with the world. They are just Power Hungry Autocratic Dictatorship.
4782	110306	@LondonBreed Why is Covid-19 vaccine out and yet business still closed? why are things not back to normal why is it taking months on purpose who is be hide the bull shit who is getting rich?          Peace on earth
4783	108026	Normally I stay on my side of the fence. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but this women has 250k followers. This is the world without one vaccine!This women should be made to work one shift in a COVID ward, without PPE and then use her meditation. Lets see how she fairs
4784	111458	Even after a COVID-19 vaccine comes out and it works, the Democratics will not be willing to give up on there power that they gained so easily. They will try to keep there tight grip on everyone.
4785	112229	@benshapiro I had mandatory vaccines to attend school  (I'm 62) my kids had mandatory vaccines to attend school (they're teens now), what is the difference @benshapiro ? BTW, I bet you had the covid19 vaccine,  right?
4786	107780	@ccpolitics123 @jaketapper The herd immunity you recommend is estimated at 60-80% of the population. No one, including NY, is safe yet.    Another factor is that when the virus does not kill, it can cause terrible, perhaps lifelong damage.    Also, the annual flu vaccine works against a coronavirus.
4787	110466	This government's idea of dealing well with #coronavirus is hospitals coping, the economy continuing as though there isn't a pandemic and using cases to find a vaccine. It's not to prevent cases. They don't care if people get sick, have long term problems or die. 1/
4788	108345	Is it me or this administration is using black doctors and nurses as props for encouraging Americans to accept the vaccine? First to get COVID-19 and die, First to test the vaccine. Doc Rivers: ‘It’s amazing why we keep loving this country, and this country does not love us back’
4789	110607	Lmao @ all the men in my DM after I posted about Covid-19 causing erectile dysfunction.Yall want the vaccine now huh?
4790	108522	I don't know why foreign residents from countries that don't  have universal health care system are desperately finding fault in ours.  Japan needs to modify some of it to match this global pandemic explosion, yes, but COVID-19 vaccine is not the holy grail.   1/2
4791	109681	Honestly the coronavirus vaccine is really fucking cool. Instead of using dead pieces of the virus they are using the RNA which our own cells will use as a blueprint to create proteins shaped like SPIKES, hence the name coronavirus. Our cells will know how to make tiny crowns now
4792	110167	Any person that discourages vaccination—whether passively or actively—is just either plain unaware or deliberately malicious. There’s been ample research and reasoning on getting the COVID-19 vaccine: it stifles the chance of powerful mutations, and allows the return to normalcy
4793	112592	@kieraevebutler Kiera your comment about me being a vaccine skeptic is inaccurate and offensive. I'm not vaccine skeptical.  If you watched my IGTV on the coronavirus vaccine rather than making a facile assumption you'd know this. I expect a correction (and an apology would be nice).
4794	108050	And you wonder why people are concerned about getting vaccinated.. I’m not an anti, but completely understand why people would hesitate.. there is no long term data, no matter how much you claim ppl are stupid not to blindly get the jab

4801	112447	In China 0,006% caught the virus resulting in 3200 deaths. Can anyone do the math for 60% of population catching the virus?This is crazy, we need containment and lock down; we need vaccine immunity not herd immunity killing millions
4802	111402	There're a lot of reasons this is terrible but just one of them is now they've incentivised unvaccinated people to show up to work even when they're sick and/or to avoid getting tested.🙄Vaccine mandates are good but they cannot be enforced with policies like these.
4803	111121	In all seriousness, can I sue someone that is vaccinated for giving me COVID because they are knowingly going around spreading the virus? Because I can sue someone that gives my HIV who knowingly spreads it…. #FoodForThought #Covid #CovidVaccine #coronavirus

4814	109151	@GovParsonMO I don't believe the vaccine has gone through enough testing and with the way the COVID19 mutates, no vaccine is going to be effective at any given time.  I think we are going to see some major health issues arise from these vaccines.
4815	110457	@PPHEricRussell How long have we been waiting for a vaccine for the common cold? That is also a coronavirus. I wouldn't hold my breath for an effective vaccine. They have already distinguished over 30 different mutations of this one.
4816	110628	I'm so pumped for the Vaccine.  I wish I could get right now. I want to drink it.  I want to sprinkle it on my food. I want newborns to take it..
4817	111846	@NBCNews I am in the 16% who will not be getting the COVID-19 vaccine!! I’m healthy, if I get COVID I will survive like 99.5% who get it.

4820	110156	Edwards: feds are holding back half their available COVID-19 vaccine to ensure those who get the first round of shots will get the necessary second shots. Louisiana will not do that. Will distribute all we get with confidence we will get another shipment.
4821	108020	But the Vaccine doesn’t working forever only for temporary to save lives humans.  If you lucky and healthy you will okay. But when you go out still need to wear mask to protect yourself. You don’t know who else still has a Covid19 spread. I am always wearing mask  when go out.
4822	108808	@dpakman There's a certain level of optimism/pessimism at play. It's been months since lockdown and we still didn't beat it. We've never have a coronavirus vaccine. If you don't think we'll eliminate it, lockdown doesn't make sense beyond keeping hospitals from being overrun.
4823	112646	@nickhalme @MLevitt_NP2013 With respect, you don't know what you're talking about. A pandemic is a widespread infection. Covid-19 has produced a pandemic. It's from the coronavirus family - that doesn't mean a vaccine can't be produced, nor that you can't get population immunity.

4827	202179	I received my 2nd COVID-19 vaccine shot yesterday, thank GOD! I am very grateful to everyone who made this possible. https://t.co/gTuhK1tFXP
4828	110344	@nypost The reason is #Immunology #HealthcareWorker #HCW’s already exposed, #infected or tested positive with #antibodies against #COVID19 don’t need #vaccine.This is #science, they’re already immune.@ABCWorldNews @CNN @NBCNews @CBSNews @MSNBC @nytimes @washingtonpost
4829	107884	@PhDVoice @PostdocVoice My manuscript on COVID-19 mRNA vaccine nanoparticle delivery has been under review for three months now. I just emailed the editor and I am yet to get a reply. What is the average duration of review?Has anyone had the same experience?
4830	108398	This is good.  NYC can't fire half the department.  Standing together is the only way to fight this. The vaccine is dangerous and will decimate the first responders and medical personnel.
4831	109359	Why on earth are Germans so anti vaccine given how much benefits vaccines have brought to humanity (think, e.g., about polio, measles, ...)? 🤦‍♂️
4832	112752	So a Coronavirus vaccine may be available soon. Gee, I wonder how much safety testing will go into it before market? None?!?🤔🤔🤔
4833	201927	Day 0: In order to receive my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine I had to consent to Microsoft’s new promotional and special offers email list. Weird... #vaccineSideEffects #COVID19
4834	107999	It's not that they're so desperate to get you to take the COVID vaccine. It's that they're desperate not to give you healthcare.

4836	107975	"This is utter insanity. Injecting kids?I swear to God if anyone in Australia tries to go anywhere near my 13 yr old daughter with a syringe full of #CV19 ""vaccine"" then you'd better be wearing safety goggles bc I will deadset stab you fair square in the f*cking eyeball with it"
4837	108550	@wesbury @benshapiro @ianbremmer We have animal vaccines for a coronvirus and we've never had the motivation or incentives to make a vaccine for a coronavirus until now. So I'm bullish on the vaccine front.All I'm saying is that we can't be cavalier about spread among 20 year olds for all sorts of reasons.
4838	202406	Have to say that I am pretty happy tonight. Got my first dose of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine today with my husband. It is the beginning of the end of our quarantine. Second dose on 1/26/21. Looks like a better year w new president and less covid. https://t.co/jZnYHmKBzw
4839	110439	@_J3551C4 @CP24 Or the vaccines don’t work at all to stop transmission and infection like they were promised too… Not to mention unnecessary mass testing and widespread positive attribution to asymptomatic people who may or may not have a coronavirus like the common cold… 🙄
4840	108435	Every festival this year is going to be cancelled. The reality is without a vaccine, mass group gatherings will not be able to go ahead safely. It's a catastrophic blow to the whole sector. #Festivalshttps://t.co/aejfxpRb5v
4841	110103	@Jazzdoggie2 @nytimes False. If they wanted to protect themselves and they trusted the vaccine, they would take it by their own free will. And in fact they did that. Obviously the situation with covid-19 is very different. Don't let the Fake News Media and Dems brainwash you son.
4842	112570	Today I will be goi g to work without a vaccine thanks to @fordnation oh and he also took away my paid sick days. But then again I’m a dispensable black person why would the @OntarioPCParty care #FordfailedOntario
4843	109992	If Europeans or Bill Gates wanted to kill Africans they would have done it long ago and wouldn't have to use COVID-19 vaccine. It would've been easier to use McDonald's, KFC, Starbucks, Pepsi, Coca Cola, Fanta, Colgate, Heineken, Amstel etc
4844	109917	Someone explain to me: if #COVID19 doesn't affect kids in any obvious way, why would some try to make vaccines mandatory for them?
4845	107794	At this point a vaccine is the only way out of this thing. It's already spread too far and too fast. #coronavirus #COVID2019
4846	112506	Now Dolly Parton has funded the Covid-19 Vaccine and I'm reminded again of a great mindset. Do good - and if you want the plastic surgery and it's not harming anyone go get it, don't judge and give back too. 3/3
4847	109222	@def_not_sophie @hrtablaze Coronavirus vaccine will never happen. These mutate too quickly. The hope is that they mutate into a less deadly strain
4848	108428	So,let’s say the lockdown is over in Ireland,No #coronavirus vaccine in the world of yet, the fatal virus is still in the country &amp; other countries around the world- Is it now safe to be in public, in the workplace &amp; in school ? Just sayin ❗️
4849	202355	Five years ago today I lost my mom. Today I honor her by protecting myself and others by getting vaccinated. My friends, be good to your mom and be good to yourself ♥️ #HappyMothersDay #COVID19 #Vaccine #GetVaccinated #VaccinesSaveLives #BeAHero https://t.co/7Cg1GkEcpn
4850	111654	I went to go get my covid-19 vaccine and it was at some sketchy place and one guy was heating up a spoon or something… Idk but they forgot to give me my card so I have no way of getting my free @krispykreme donut 😞
4851	111488	Never forget this is still used to push the vaccine.Henry Dyne (pictured) is an award winning crisis actor.They've actually went out their way to hide the replies to this tweet, calling them out for what they are.Scumbags of the highest order.
4852	110014	@CP24 My question is it’s been proven by many scientist that this virus mutates itself within 10 hours so how is this vaccine going to cure COVID-19 if it mutates itself that quickly? And how does it take a decade to produce other vaccines but this took under a year?
4853	202377	Got the first covid-19 vaccine today!If you're going to get it from Mbagathi Hospital, like me, use election day timing. I got there at 8.30am and got the vaccine at 1.30pm then shortly after, they'd ran out so be there early! Here are some other venues giving vaccines. https://t.co/fKrbNuSavd
4854	111875	So China has been quiet regarding a #vaccine . You would have expected them to have the first vaccine for #COVID19. Very strange you don’t even hear about their infections nothing? While the rest of the world grappling with a #newstrain #newstraincovid 🤷‍♂️🤭👀
4855	110196	Oh my god, good news! My mother got the first of the two-stage #COVID19 vaccine today!! 😊#CovidVaccine
4856	109687	@halvorz the news are saying shortage of medicines in gral. What are they using to counter coronavirus since there's no vaccine?
4857	112842	@PedzisaiRuhanya Covid-19 virus has a right to life, vaccine will kill the virus, that's not cool. The virus has rights to exist in us.
4858	109325	I'll tell you what, if the vaxer's can get past the shots from my gun, then I'll take their shot of vaccine!
4859	109996	I live in AZ.  If THE TRAITOR @dougducey makes that VACCINE MANDATORY Fla is where I'm moving.  I've NEVER had a FLU vaccine and Not taking the LUCIFERase mRNA Covid Vaccine
4860	109826	Right. Because getting the vaccine is only about the self interest and safety of the individual...not that person's loved ones or their loved ones. This is so gross.
4861	110925	So, how did they not know this? There are dozens of vaccines on the market.. more proof they have no clue as to what they're doing and they don't work
4862	108868	So Sajid Javid is saying ‘as long as a minor is competent they can overrule their parents’ by having the vaccine.In the #BMJ it has already stated that there is no medical benefit to jabbing kids.  The govt to taking our social freedom for granted. #VaccinePassports #COVID19
4863	110520	So fair to say it make no difference if you have vaccine or not you still going to get it and vaccine does do much to stop it
4864	108097	Im afraid to  touch that vaccine  trump rushed it they said next year but now they say nov i hope ppl that get it will be ok
4865	112128	My question would be how much time until this variant becomes extinct (and if it matters for the vaccine) 😁 #justkidding
4866	112221	What happened to all those politicians being on the news as they were getting their first jab coronavirus vaxx?Have They forgotten to back for the second, third etc? They can’t possibility claim that they are fully jabbed,can they? #mRNA #COVIDIOT #COVID19 #covidID #BBCBreakfast
4867	112032	#Markets have been facing unprecedented volatility throughout the #coronavirus pandemic, no one knows for certain how they will react to a #vaccine. Great read.#marketcrash #stockmarketcrash #marketrecovery #portfoliorecovery @Stocktwits
4868	201925	This damn vaccine is no JOKE 😩 my arm TF man I am not ready for round 2 of it 💉🥴... #CovidVaccine#Covid19
4869	110214	I don't get the point. Fully vaccinated people can spread covid.. plus u18s don't need a negative test so they can go in and spread covid anyways!!! Still haven't seen a valid reason why vaccine passports work.
4870	111877	@chicagobeers1 @Causeway06 @SeanCasten Coronavirus’s have been around forever and they aren’t going away. Similar to the flu. It’ll be here. The vaccine only work 3-6 months and it’s looking like they’re not very effective. We can’t live in fear forever.
4871	112613	When pressed to clarify, WHO Spokes-neutral gendered non declarative asexual person said, “Sure we said the vaccine was necessary to “get back to normal”, but then we realized we can’t keep you locked down that way so.... sorry, you’re fooked.” 🤬🤪
4872	112161	@crookeddy @Augusthenriksen @groanlivia @AndrewYang No treatment? Have you been living under a rock? How do you think all these patients with Covid-19 get released to go home?! THEY RECEIVE HEALTHCARE/TREATMENT! There isn’t a cure or vaccine but there’s treatment.
4873	109862	So no #COVID19 vaccine for all in India, Hmm! But isn't this advocated all around the world? Big question will be who gets #coronavirus vaccine? Would the ruling parties prefer their voters? Would rich and powerful will benefit and poor and needy be left out? @MoHFW_INDIA
4874	109403	@User_First_Last @florian_krammer @Valueinvestor41 The idea we’ll never get a good enough vaccine to eliminate this coronavirus (or make it endemic) is beyond pessimistic thinking. Getting a good vaccine in 2020-21, from thereout perfect while minimizing transmissions and developing therapeutics
4875	110351	.@JohnCornyn, because of math. If comprehensive eligibility (rather vaccinating everyone) starts in May, give it two months for everyone to get the two doses of the vaccine + 2 weeks waiting period.
4876	111855	@HouseGOP #republicans are supporting an insane president #trump who is blocking YOUR #covidreliefbill  YOU will get NO #VACCINE , NO #UNEMPLOYMENTBenefits No aid for #hospitals #FrontLineHeroes NO #stimuluscheck They let #covid19 spread now they want us homeless and starving #COVIDrelief
4877	111901	@QTWIQ1 This is why we get VACCINATED, so that we don't land in your situation.    I got Covid-19 before new years. Guess what, it only lasted one day.   Vaccine did its job.   Hope you feel better.  But if not then I pray God receives you in his kingdom.
4878	112334	C's kagwe has a point but poorly presented. The vaccine being marketed has the ability to modify our genes which is irreversible. Are we now in agreement to have Gene modified human beings when we have all the time refused Gene modified foods.
4879	112784	So much for ‘following the science.’The science isn’t clear, that much is obvious and this is why no one should be discriminated against for not taking this vaccine just yet, especially if they’re young and healthy.
4880	110850	Btw: Results for our #COVID19 clinic this week show PLENTY of positive ppl in the area. The pandemic hasn’t ended - we can only try to contain it till a vaccine/proven therapy. So if u wanna lose gyms, salons, &amp; stores again? Then keep disregarding the rules meant to protect us.
4881	108692	@MirrorMoney @DailyMirror Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
4882	110390	@FTondalo Agreed... The second wave will be much bigger, and more deadly as it will completely overwhelm medical facilities.There's nothing resembling a treatment or a cure, and vaccines are far off--and may not even work for this variant of beta coronavirus.This may not go away.
4883	111889	@washingtonpost Just now GOD/ALLAH/SHIV has suggested one mentioned below vaccine for this Coronavirus ---------
4884	202193	My cancer institute contacted me and said I was eligible for the covid-19 vaccine and I was nervous and sat there for like an hour listening to @nickcarter @aj_mclean @howied @kevinrichardson @brian_littrell @backstreetboys but I got it. https://t.co/YVWJYlHNSq
4885	112722	@mattjevans @nanogenomic @devisridhar There has never been a *failed* vaccine for a human coronavirus. Look at it that way round. Either not worth the bother (upper resp tract viruses), eradicated before vaccine could be developed (SARS) or still in development (MERS).

4887	109296	@Sheer_Light @jhowellchrist @washingtonpost I'll go ahead and take the COVID-19 vaccine if they go ahead and be liable for any harmful side effects. It is only fair. If the vaccines are really safe, then they should have no problem being liable for any rare severe side effects. The moment they do it, i'll go right away 😃

4891	108375	This protest is silly.  They have a choice.  Don’t get jabbed if you don’t want to.  It’s not compulsory
4892	111208	@Shirley1314a had flu 3 times. Worked MD volunteer clinic 5 years ago they demanded I take a flu shot = got the flu. Happened again. 2 yrs ago had symptoms of Covid-19 before there was awareness. Left me with no smell. Will not take the vaccines. Not against them but no mandates

So Mr Mark, in earlier tweet my Q ' Is there any racial issue here?It meant that, is it because the #CovishieldVaccine manufactured in #India, it wasn't disclosed, just in case people still have pre-1945 issues, otherwise to me any vaccine is good to keep #coronavirus away!
4895	109167	@ABC I think this is the prelude to much bigger crisis. Reinfection of #coronavirus #COVID19 after taking the vaccine. Once again the a symptomatic may be dangerous after taking the vaccine then virus mutates and spreads this may be called #COVID21 dangerous of all before.
4896	110206	I'm not taking a coronavirus vaccine. No way it's safe. We've been trying to end cancer, the common cold, AIDS, herpes, bells palsy, Alzheimer's, and dementia for centuries, but I'm supposed to believe we have a safe vaccine for Coronavirus in less than a year?

4898	108402	Coronavirus has obviously changed all our routines. What’s the one trip or course you simply can’t get to during the pandemic (for whatever reason) that you miss most of all? And what’s the one place you’ll go asap once there is a vaccine? #GolfTripX #GolfChat
4899	108207	I can't wait to get the Coronavirus Vaccine so I can hug perfectly again.....But I'll have to wait until either March or April to get it. That's when it becomes available to everyone. Why can't I get it right now?

4902	112025	"@nadia_sapphire The Pfizer vaccine teaches your immune system to recognise and attack a certain protein that is part of the COVID causing coronavirus. It doesn't contain the virus. The side effects would simply be your immune system going ""WHOAH, WHY IS THIS NEW PROTEIN HERE, I SHALL KILL IT!"""
4903	109983	RNA vaccines were developed against the lung diseases SARS&amp;MERS,which like COV-19 were caused by coronaviruses.Not only did these vaccines not have long-term efficacy,but they also caused severe autoimmune reactions in the lung tissue,which is why they did not pass clinical trial
4904	112228	@LightHappy4 The Awake quoted an article from Vaccine Magazine from 2003. So in reality, Vaccine Magazine predicted Coronavirus in 2003, not Jehovah’s Witnesses in 2005. Do some proper research.

4907	109414	@BBCWorld @realDonaldTrump if you make it mandatory for all Americans to take this vaccine you will lose my family's vote. These covid-19 numbers are bullshit and you know it. Don't make me vote for the brain dead candidate. Also enough with the dam facemasks. #NoManditoryVaccine
4908	112861	Yes, wearing a mask is meaningless to stop yourself getting covid-19 and with a vaccine, you don’t need one to prevent spread. But it’s kind of ridiculous to expect people who have been used to wearing them for like a year now to immediately drop it. Give it like 2 months.
4909	109643	Made the mistake of telling my family that I am scheduling COVID-19 vaccines &amp; my phone has never rang like this... 😳 I cannot get fired over yo ass. You not 65 or a HCW, fam!
4910	109466	@Thanduxolobell1 @News24 We are a news tracker of the COVID-19 vaccine for all countries, it looks likely Americans will get access to the vaccine. But the big ques. is precisely how effective it ends up being.
4911	109516	@Jmtommas @WhiteHouse The coronavirus vaccine developers have been working on similar virus vaccines for a very long time. Once they had the make up of the virus, they were able to focus on the best way to attack it. Science wins, but they've been at it since the 1st coronavirus hit.

4916	109843	Yup, seniors were told they were vulnerable but according to @fordnation 's so called 'plan' not vulnerable enough to warrant a vaccine in Phase 1.  Like all children, I want my 83 year old father to be able to leave the house without fear.  Ford has really screwed this up.
4917	109858	Gonna leave this here. I theorized months ago that the reason the vaccine was so quick to develop is because it was already in existence. They developed it in conjunction with possible weaponization of Covid according to this article. Still, tons of naysayers in the thread.
4918	110060	Whatever the aftermath may be, once the #CoronavirusPandemic  is over, one thing is sure nobody is going to rebuke a person wearing a hijab in the open.The only people to come against this will be those who have always been islamphobics

4920	112135	@ArmyofShadows2 @photographerXA All vaccines are experimental. It takes years of assessment to fine tune a medical product, like a vaccine. Fortunately, scientists started working on the CV19 vaccine in 2002, during the SARS Coronavirus pandemic.

4927	110026	@anthonysargean2 @DavidHuddo No.  A vaccine, safe or otherwise, may never be developed. No vaccine has ever been developed for a coronavirus in humans. And a new vaccine may need to be introduced every year as with flu.  We need to get on with our lives, accept a degree of risk and protect those most at risk
4928	202191	This is truly heartbreaking, my heart goes out to the children and relatives who are dealing with this loss, BTW YES I AM FULLY VACCINATED AGAINST COVID-19, AND I AM READY FOR MY THIRD COVID-19 BOOSTER SHOT!

4932	108211	Positive #COVIDー19 news for May 5:- Pfizer begins human trials in the U.S. for the vaccine- Israeli scientists isolate COVID-19 antibody- California records first drop in weekly coronavirus deaths- Shanghai Disneyland plans to reopen on May 11
4933	112173	Big pharma has managed to churn out not one but 2 coronavirus vaccines in under a year and yet scientists have yet to crack the code that keeps my sandwiches from getting drenched in mustard water. This is unacceptable.
4934	111388	uhh can we like maybe ban the US from going anywhere? If we all get vaccines and they don't, I don't want them going anywhere near us

4937	110772	An effective pre exposure prophylactic for COVID-19 would be fantastic even as our awesome scientists work on vaccines. I don't think I have once heard this option discussed in Ghana. Is it because its not a viable option?

4939	112713	@NightWatchman21 Great job!  2 weeks ago, I had the coronavirus (or assume I did, kid had to get tested for school and was +).  I had 24 hrs of fever but otherwise felt fine.  My vaxxed wife felt worse like Wachter's-son.  I credit my immune system and not taking the vax for my mild symptoms.
4940	112920	Yeah, cuz one party is the party of:- vaccines are bad (unless framed as *Trump's* vaccine)- masks don't work- lockdowns are bad- COVID-19 is basically just the flu- Dr. Fauci is evil- going back to the pre-Obamacare days
4941	107946	Come on, Michigan. I want to see my mom in assisted living. Mask Up, social distance and stay home if you can. Also, get the vaccine.
4942	110385	Mutations, not enough vaccine, and #covidiots egged on by the Reopen Now crowd still worry me.But this is another solid #coronavirus report, and for that I am grateful.
4943	201869	My youngest brother, a hospital physician, received his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine this week and I, a young adult author, let out a breath I didn’t realize I was holding in.
4944	111144	"Just a thought: what if all the money spent on ""new conservative"" think tank conferences, culture war blogs and venal political candidates had funded an ethical COVID-19 vaccine instead? They don't want to win; just to keep you dumb and angry.#AppearanceAndReality🤔"
4945	112933	So the coronavirus is just as bad as the flu? If that's the case then we don't need a vaccine? And if that's the case we don't need to be locked down and wearing masks and being held hostage in our homes? You mean we can go to church, school &amp;sporting events, reopen the academy?

4948	109019	How safe does this make my fellow parents feel re: jabbing a Covid vaccine into our children who are NOT even at risk? Am I supposed to sacrifice my kid to this?“We’re never going to learn about how safe this vaccine is unless we start giving it. That’s just the way it goes.”
4949	112295	People know their own bodies, their immune system.If you don't normally get the common cold, viruses, flu..... don't get flu shot--- why should you get the vaccine.
4950	108167	@jasjiv @naomirwolf If you missed it like we all might have done, reported like an after thought that a covid19 survivor only needs the first jab, as a booster. If that isn't stupidity it is a devil may care attitude. No one in their right mind would follow that recommendation.
4951	111902	love that we’re protecting the small number of Somali HCWs serving Alberta. this will go a long way in convincing people in my community to take the vaccine when their turn comes.

4957	109206	Iowa hasn't yet implemented any incentive programs to encourage people to get vaccines. What do you think would work?
4958	108486	They'll be vaccinating our cats next... more money we'll have to pay out, more money in the vaccine producers pocket.  Or maybe not... maybe they'll just kill all the cats like they did in China.😐#covid19 #vaccination
4959	110760	Rephrase the poll question to be you can't work in an office, goto a restaurant, gym, sporting event, school, salon, or concert unless you get a vaccine. Would you then?
4960	112349	@kenkelly1 @LaFleurDelSur @21WIRE And the very reason I process what he is articulating to make the informed decision that it would have to be an exceptionally cold day in hell before any COVID-19 jab comes my way.
4961	112081	This article just makes it sound like LGBTQ people aren't getting the vaccine because they're antivaxxers, fat, and stupid.
4962	112639	It's because there's nothing they can do about it.  It's not like we have a national health service. A vaccine is at best months away.  A stimulus check...? It's destroying these towns, it is actually worth the risk.  The virus *might* affect them, but poverty definitely will.
4963	108310	The Pilbright/Gates work they reference is for an avian coronavirus - but it's a live-attenuated virus, which means there's a probability that some of the inoculated poultry will get sick.  An analogy is contracting polio from the Sabin oral vaccine.
4964	202233	Today is a great day! Not only is it my 1-year anniversary (back) at @timmonsgroup, but it's also the day my wife, a school teacher, will receive her first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.
4965	112905	I am glad that you have this chance rather than being forced to take the vaccine. However, once a week sounds pretty stupid. You could come down with Covid the day after and infect any number of people before they test you again if you are not symptomatic.  No logic.
4966	112813	My dad is a kidney transplant patient as well. We don't yet know if he managed to develop antibodies. His condition is the reason we have been in this house for 600+ days, only leaving for groceries and medicine. Please keep masking, socially distancing, and get vaxxed.
4967	202018	@DrSwatiShow My family friend got Covid19 even after taking Covisheild vaccine. So which vaccine is better Covisheild or Covaxin? Is the 2nd dose heavy to Senior citizens ?
4968	111384	@EricTopol @DLeonhardt @nytgraphics so question.  if covid vaccines get the covid-19 deaths on the order of historic flu deaths will you support having life go back to normal?  My answer is an emphatic yes!

4974	111328	@KEEMSTAR Just wait, there's gonna be a coronavirus vaccine that antivax parents still won't trust in
4975	112087	Would you prefer we were like China?  They are sending out most of their vaccine and hardly allowing any of their citizens to be vaccinated.  They are using the vaccine as a political tool to curry favor with other countries.
4976	108609	May (The Month) will be when I can start getting the Covid-19 vaccine, if stocks are available by then.Might do a blood work to see what other vaccines I lack or need a new boost.Plus it's been 2 years since my last flu. Annual Influenza Vaccinations do work.
4977	109159	"@pcrclaims @Yeadoncampaign ""The coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and drug maker AstraZeneca has shown an average efficacy of 70 percent, depending on dosage"".Only 70% ? Too bad if you're in the  30%  and remember, they are not responsible for any damage to your  health."
4978	108595	You can't make this stuff up (unless it is made up). Pharma company called #Gilead. Legally trying to stop others from getting a vaccine because they want to make all the money.
4979	110737	This drains my confidence !!  Social Distance should be kept until they get a vaccine!!   The Virus wont disappear at the Government say so!!!😳
4980	112809	This is Bad.  With a capital B.I'm desperately hoping that the phrasing of the question just left people maybe not answering what we think they are here.  Many may have just been answering whether or not they'd take an untested vaccine rushed out for Trump's political benefit.
4981	109436	@schristakos @BetheMckenzie @friendlyfulcrum @austinfiredept These are very good questions.  The answer is, no almost no one who has a vaccine has died from covid19 or other vaccine related complications. The numbers are minuscule.  And it is a valid question to ask. Taking the vaccine saves lives. You are alive today because of vaccines.
4982	112072	Thank you! (My brother is also in a Phase 3 clinical trial for #CovidVaccine, they did not pick me ☹️) #Vaccineswork
4983	112716	@AndreaEleanorF1 @BBCNews I'm not saying that this first vaccine isn't effective, but and a big but they've only proven the vaccine has so far low side effects.Why i said 0, is that it looks as if the 44k where not given a covid19 viral load to test against immunity.
4984	110071	@realRicBosiLTC @sabhlok @therealrukshan @reignitedemaust @JoelJammal are you not surprised? This is the push for vaccine. Perth &amp; Tas next.
4985	108357	Got my vaccine at about 9:45am today and so far this whole day my mouth has tasted like copper. But that's all for now! I'll happily take it. 🤪💉💉 #CovidVaccine #SecondDose #PfizerVaccine #COVID19
4986	109214	@pnjaban They obviously are on a power trip.  We were told by them the vaccine would protect against the variants, this too, must not be true. A scientist on the Ebola vaccine committee said this COVID19 vaccine wl not protect; &amp; yet it wl compromise ur immune sys 4/variant.
4987	107959	I don’t get how there’s suddenly a bunch of ‘safe’ vaccines when we were told it could take years to develop one.
4988	111007	I'll go the @SuperBowl under these circumstances:1) There is a vaccine2) Someone gives me $2K for a ticket3) The @steelers are in it.
4989	110368	This is excellent! I'm team Moderna too.One of the best simple explanations I've seen so far of why the #COVID19 vaccine was able to get created so fast.  Please share this with those who are not vaccinated to help with convincing them to do it.
4990	112763	@RosieRobertsonx @_seevy @Elliech_ Those vaccines have been around for years NOW, but people swarmed to get the polio vaccine because of how rampant it was. You’re missing the point with that one. Covid-19 is a virus, and so is the flu. The basis for the flu vaccine has been approved for years, but each—
4991	109812	They still don't have FDA approval for ANY covid vaccine.  All are still on emergency use authorization.  Flu shots are at least approved.So yes, that does impose on my liberty.  If you want to keep taking these experiments, be my guest.
4992	108509	@DavidLevan15 @lucyallan @BorisJohnson People keep talking about immunity. Current (small) results suggest immunity gone within 6 months. Just like other coronavirus. It will need yearly vaccines that will be only partially effective.
4993	109712	Lol people are living in a fantasy world. Everyone who wants a covid test can't get one, pretty sure government is going to mess this up too. Also, we don't even have a vaccine yet anyways.
4994	112474	The continual Coronavirus Vaccine gloating from the UK is ugly, and not particularly clever. If they stumble, and it is far from over, the rest of the world isn't going to rush to help.Quite the opposite, I would expect...
4995	111659	This vaccine has completely exhausted me, massive headache, no sleep and feel sick. Can only imagine what getting Covid-19 for real would be like
4996	112485	yall mfks who don't follow the rules lmao do u know that covid-19 spread through the air and if everyone doesn't want to give cooperation, vaccine is useless at this point too like what i said they spread through air
4997	107688	Is this my “lesson”? lol it’s fucked up to require people to get vaccines if they don’t want it. Sorry not sorry.
4998	108843	Moderna has just asked for an emergencyapproval of their Vaccine for the COVID-19 FAKE virus. How could they have a vaccine for a virus that the CDC says has yet to be identified? Trump or Biden, they both plan to force all ofus to get the vaccine or lose our rights!

5006	110145	@MrMoeOthman The vaccine will be voluntary, because it won’t really be a vaccine for this coronavirus, but for the next one, the real bio weapon. It will be released to kill anyone who refused the vaccine, because those are the people who don’t fall in line with everything the govt says
5007	110568	most of the western countries are availing chinas covid vaccine too even they’re procuring the ones fr developed nations. it’s a bitter pill to swallow but if you can see it China’s doing great since mid 2020 while the rest of us are still in the black hole😔
5008	110978	The No. 4 reason why service personnel are refusing the vaccine:“This is the first time I get to tell the Army NO!” Good reason. 🙄And, yes, this is completely different than the anthrax case.
5009	111787	The UK army an 77th brigade spying on us and using its cyber thugs to bully an make fun of anyone with a different view than the government on vaccines.WHY? They are really trying hard to talk us into taking this vaccine.If it was so safe then why do they need to talk us into it

5014	112852	@QuarantinedCoof @UndercoverFunk #7, actually, and new cases is a TERRIBLE metric, since this disease has no vaccine (and it never will, just like every other Coronavirus), it will eventually get EVERYONE on a long enough timescale. https://t.co/kwUqGfWVim
5015	108828	Then stop calling it a vaccine...Vaccines protect people from the virus...Like polio, measles and mumps...Just call it what it is...An injection of who knows what to counter act god knows...And there will need to be booster shots too...Wake up it's 14months too late for this!
5016	111424	We don't need your vaccine, you've not dealt with the disturbing Microsoft Windows OS, it's human viruses you want to deal with. You're not a medical practitioner, we know your evil plans, it won't work...

5027	111616	Why do vaccine targets matter when they don't work? Why not allow people to choose how they deal with covid and not force a vax that has limited benefits and potential risks.
5028	108331	@MichaelDeutch @RonnyDirtNap @okkie48 @pet_surft @tedcruz If masks work.. why covid-19 is still growing in countries who mandated it? And why vaccines if masks work?

5031	108746	@J2KChoiceCuts @annif007 @gemjandrews @BBCBreaking You could make that argument for many different illnesses, that's life, you can't lock everything down every time there is a potential threat. Covid-19 isn't going to disappear, it will be around forever, but hopefully there will be a vaccine for it in the yrs to come.
5032	111425	@mojos55 Flu mutates too, and we have new vaccines each year. The vaccine from Oxford was designed in a few weeks as had the technology and just needed to tweak it for coronavirus. That vaccine is already in Phase 3, it is being manufactured as I write. Read the science.
5033	108231	So...the 'vaccines' don't work? And Workplace Vx Violence doesn't work? And Medical Segregation doesn't work? Sounds like the NB government has joined the ranks of we anti-vaxxers.
5034	112757	@jdmhav3n @kellylavine @jasonrantz @GovInslee Atleast im not in a Cult thats convinced that the Vaccine against Covid-19 is something that will ruin your very DNA, make god hate you and give you Autism. You already seem to have all those boxes checked in so no Vaccine needed for you I guess.
5035	112767	@briannatravers @FerrierSteph #COVID19  #slowdownmethod I think the vaccine for the epidemic is the last chance. Why is it logically impossible to find a cure for an infectious disease before it spreads? The first is to prevent before coming, the second to control and destroy, and the third is to prevent.
5036	111175	@DaFlumps @kradlum @NHSuk You cannot read? It says, They Don't Know if the vaccine can stop spreading, catching Coronavirus or if it gives immunity. Nothing. There is no evidence. You are free to think what you like and refuse to hear what you are told and what is in front of your eyes.
5037	108723	I'd stab anyone trying to force a vaccine into my arm then I'd never stop killing those responsible. I'd assume I'm dead already and take as many with me as possible. All the animals died in SARS &amp; MERS mRNA studies so deadly FDA denied Human trials.Resistance no matter the price

5039	109936	@Ashaman3000 @Lizzy_Lang7 @PryceTheHeretic #9 is the reason they should get a vaccine, and hope not to get a Covid-19 infection.
5040	110222	@thedsggroup The vaccine is important long term. Particularly for the most vulnerble.And when covid19 mutates, they need to be able to adapt quickly and possibly annually like the flu.So that's still good research.3/end
5041	112255	@KHONnews Why in the world would someone who already had coronavirus get the vaccine? Newsflash everyone: if surviving coronavirus doesn't give you immunity, we're all fucked, because that would mean we have no idea how anything works.

5043	109619	@SDECoxHealth My not be a medical expert but I have a brain. Coronavirus is an RNA virus that mutates more rapidly than other viruses. So even though we magically had these vaccines in the US before the virus or right after it didn't get us ahead of new variants.
5044	112213	So when the vaccine is developed for Covid 19, do the anti-vaxxers get it or do they stick with their beliefs and die? #antivaxx #coronavirus #COVID19
5045	109045	Urgh this tears me down. It's definitely not ethical but if we don't have everyone vaccinated there would be so much transmission risk- if there was a way to combat socioeconomic barriers for equitable access to the vaccine then maybe a mandate is okay? Feeling conflicted #hst440
5046	111981	There's a good chance the Covid-19 vaccine we are all waiting for will be developed abroad. Actions like this almost guarantee the U.S. won't be prioritized if/when it is.

5052	111059	@ashleyroybal Well, I was meant to be going Paris for June 2020 but then Covid-19 so flights changed to Malta for next year, where it’s bit safer and hopefully vaccine is out by then. Don’t want to cancel that, really need a holiday.
5053	112246	While the coronavirus mutations are useful for telling lineages apart, they don’t have any apparent effect on how the virus works.That’s good news for scientists working on a vaccine.
5054	110610	@or_pip Once governments decided en masse to “tackle” coronavirus they were locked in. Moral panic to extent, but nevertheless only one way out of this nightmare - defeat coronavirus. Sceptics are now also locked in to a mirror narrative. That’s a mistake because they’ll have to have jab
5055	109867	Scientists do not know if the Covid-19 vaccines, being injected into arms around the world, will protect against the NEW Coronavirus StrainsTherefore, you are a fool (noi !!) if you are not taking the 8 steps described in this articlegoogle healthline new coronavirus strains
5056	107970	This thread is just interesting for me. It cannot be the case that the people don't know COVID-19 but they know the vaccine. That is a misconceived opinion. How then are they going to get to know about covid? Until we experience the Brazil situation?

5058	111444	@TobyBerry6325 Astra Zeneca is using a chimp adenovirus to create a protective immune response that would attack Covid19 if there is exposure to it. I believe the Russian vaccine is using the same adenovirus for their vaccine.
5059	109263	No sense in rushing it. If it does come before election day, (based on how long it usually takes to go through the various phases of any drug or vaccine for safety, dosage and efficacy) we will KNOW it is bogus. That is why Mitch is trying to get the liability laws changed.
5060	111432	if you drank papa jac out of a vuvuzela at sanse in 2011 then you don't need to worry what's in the coronavirus vaccine
5061	111183	@JamesWo83215114 @CP24 Apparently you didn’t get the memo, you will not go back to normal you will still have restrictions and you will have to wear a mask. Also the vaccine only helps with symptoms does not prevent coronavirus.
5062	108898	@EssexPR We’ve gone round in a huge unnecessary circle on the science. Why comparisons to influenza viruses came in I don’t know. That virus mutates way faster than coronavirus. Exposure to viruses gives people their super immunity. The vaccines give people a safety bet on symptoms.
5063	110479	#coronavirus ...  Israeli MIGAL claims breakthrough in #coronavirusvaccine .... If they are correct.... vaccine in 90 days.  #migal
5064	202257	Worth looking at this detailed thread. Just reading this I was very happy that I have had 2 vaccination doses. I'm terrified that so few people in Australia a currently vaccinated. #CovidVaccine
5065	110787	We need to make it like the Icebucket challenge. When someone gets the vaccine, stream it, tag 5 people&amp; spread awareness. Start with the former presidents and make it a wave to show it is safe. I ❤️ this @BarackObama OR maybe our military members can head this up @travisakers
5066	110617	I believe in vaccines (and also respect the fact some do not believe they’re in the best interest of their family), but am surprised they found enough families willing to test this out. I’d spoken w/several MDs this summer who said it would be v. difficult to get test subjects.
5067	111751	@ANCALERTS @ABSCBNNews This is like comparing apples to oranges. No vaccine for coronavirus. That’s the problem
5068	110988	If you’re unvaccinated stop being stubborn, stop believing lies &amp; STOP THE SPREAD. The mRNA vaccine has nothing to do with DNA or chips &amp; everything to do with staying alive when you get Covid. You could not know how bad Covid will be until it’s too late. Why? Protect your life!
5069	112816	@eoinmadden @Interse42081117 If there is a safe vaccine using attenuated virus as 'traditional vax' with is not producing spike in your body - the actual pathogen - then I would take it after proper testing, yes. But no one ever managed that for coronavirus family of viruses before so not likely.
5070	112514	@Dsockz @drdavidsamadi This is just a version of the flu and no one will get permanent immunity to a coronavirus from a vaccination. My immune system is phenomenal. Never had the flu shot and never had the flu in my life. Won't be taking this vaccine either 4 &gt;99% recovery rate.
5071	110223	If I was a driver and a rando offered me a shot of vaccine, I would not believe it. But good on them for offering. And good on the brave folks who rolled up their sleeves and took it
5072	112249	@VaxHuntersCan This video shows you my experience on getting the #Covid #vaccine and how it is starting to change my life for the good (open up the world again)!  Check it out!https://t.co/041bk8wotXEnjoy! #COVID19 #vaccine #pandemic #coronavirus
5073	111120	@WhiteHouse What happens if China or WHO develops a vaccine to coronavirus &amp; they refuse to share it with us because the President was mean? Are you going to send in the National Guard?
5074	108782	I wonder if O’Toole understands that it is Cons Premiers who are failing in the vaccine effort. If he does  then he is politicking and if he doesn’t he’s an idiot
5075	110024	OUR BEST CHANCE OF ENDING THIS PANDEMIC is to ensure that everyone, everywhere has access to Covid-19 vaccines. No one is safe until everyone is safe. We need a #Peoplesvaccine NOW. #VaxForAllNow  #LAAdvocacyEM
5076	112858	Could say how the Coronavirus Vaccine is actually just a medical trial, But no one would say it's a experimental thing would they now?
5077	109623	Ah, it’s so refreshing that we no longer have a curfew in NYC and my neighborhood restaurants/bars and their very drunk patrons have single-handedly produced a covid-19 vaccine so everyone can fully party on the sidewalks like we’ve got a whole block party today. #blessed
5078	111925	I couldn't imagine having a child in this time of the CoronaVirus but I do have grandchildren and my Son and Daughter-in-law are NOT sending the kids back into a classroom without a vaccine or cure! It's not just the kids but teachers and anyone they all come in contact with too.
5079	110182	I keep saying, I'll be glad when I get the microchip in my vaccine so I don't have to keep using the govt COVID-19 app to swipe into shops and cafes.
5080	108092	Completely taken out of context. Fauci said in April 2020, “If ‘back to normal’ means acting like there never was a coronavirus problem, I don’t think that’s going to happen until we do have a situation where you can completely protect the population with a vaccine.”
5081	111727	@redthepianogirl Don't worry. We will get back to the good old days. COVID-19 Vaccines are coming later this year.
5082	108675	The world is racing to find a vaccine for #Covid19 -- but there's no vaccine for #ClimateChange. Tell the @ecb to stop financing big polluters and give us the #GreenRecovery our world needs. #Peoplenotpolluters
5083	110793	I treat my COVID-19 vaccine card just like my yellow vaccination card for my passport: BOTH are with my passport now.If you haven’t traveled internationally…some countries request/require additional vaccinations for your health.No one wants you to go home ill &amp; share story
5084	108371	If satan is real satan is the mf convincing stoopid people to not get the vaccine with baseless conspiracies
5085	109300	Maybe because cancer is more complex than the coronavirus... and there was an actual push to get the covid vaccine out so we can hopefully return to normal.
5086	112721	"Like I said the outrage about ""vaccine passports"" here is going to be so stupid.We really have got to stop coddling morons in this country."
5087	110367	@MattHancock I ❤️ Christmas but far too much focus on this during pandemic with no vaccine yet! People must surely realise by now celebrations have to be scaled back to protect everyone.  Feel so sorry for retailers, hospitality, suppliers, hairdressers etc🤶🏻
5088	110215	@mtgreenee America doesn't want to go back into lockdown is different than what we need to do. People like you who refuse to wear masks and refuse to take the vaccine is exactly why we have all these new mutations of COVID-19 going around. You're what is wrong with America, you're cancer.
5089	111019	Ya and this criminal has money in the vaccine he wants to make every one have so he gets even more rich just like Kill Gates!
5090	112467	I agree, @SenKamalaHarris. This will only get worse if we don’t take it more seriously. We need to ramp up testing. I’ve also introduced legislation to make the #COVID19 vaccine free once it’s available.
5091	110985	@jimcramer The Covid-19 vaccines are not being tested against a saline placebo. All other drugs are; why is this an exception? To quote you, this is sub optimal! You need to do some research.
5092	112826	You know my anxiety during quarantine has spiked pretty hard but then I remember theres people out there who genuinely believe the earth is flat, vaccines cause illnesses and the Coronavirus is made from the government in the shape of 5G cell towers &amp; just like that I feel better
5093	109741	I just found out that my mom is going to get her COVID-19 vaccine next week and I am so so so so happy. 😭 I have been beyond worried about her going in to work as nurse over these past months!
5094	109334	1) This virus has animal reservoirs meaning it can jump back and forth between humans and other hosts. So forget about we will eradicate this virus or COVIDzero2) Although our vaccines are very effective against severe #COVID19  they don't confer sterilizing immunity meaning...
5095	110678	I don't need a #coronavirus vaccine.My kids don't need it either.No microchip for me &amp; my family. The @WHO misled the world.-no human - human infection = ❎-no animal infection = ❎-not transmitted in air =❎-virus can't survive long on surfaces outside human body =❎
5096	112416	The whole story just stinks of politics. If the EU was so keen on having a proved, working vaccine, why don’t they get some from the Russians, too, and test, compare all the candidates?I’d say, follow the money, again.
5097	111942	There’s no vaccine, and next to zero chance they’ve achieved herd immunity, so what’s the most likely outcome here?
5098	111429	Only way I can explain to 5yo my work is I make coronavirus vaccines (I don’t).Concept was surprisingly intuitive (he said it sounds like a trick to body) &amp; likened antibodies to a hospital. Let me take this oppty to 🙏 my @BARDA colleagues who toil 24/7 to advance Vx trials.
5099	201996	Calm down teachers; this whole masking of students has a super simple solution.Just take out all the desks and replace with restaurant tables and chairs, and then they no longer have to wear a mask.Done.#Covid19 #Vaccine #masks #MaskUP #SaturdayVibes
5100	109537	Walgreens in Big Chimney currently has extra Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.  First come, first served. Get there now. I was told the shots have to be thrown out when they close this evening.
5101	109254	@JKAMCHACHA @Phidze72 @mwwwn201 @SibandaSibbs @njabulodhlamin3 It’s worrying. That we have all these soldiers armed to the hilt among civilians in peacetime is worrying. Covid19 is a ruse, a pretext for a sinister motive. In a normal country there would be an inquest, but in Zimbabwe, it’s done, that’s it.
5102	108672	Well one would hope so ...  However if vaxxed people still get sick and still pass the virus along what good is it really??
5103	112532	🚨 | NEW: A man has been arrested after getting the Coronavirus vaccine eight times, in order to get vaccine certification on behalf of other people
5104	111040	Why will it take Trump to convince Republicans to take the vaccine? Are they so daft? The mind boggles!!#COVID19 #DemVoice1 #COVID
5105	111165	@NixonandIke @ki676love @The_Burwel1 @WSJ Do you not understand how vaccines work?!?! A vaccine for COVID-19 Strain A will not necessarily work for COVID-19 Strain B.1.1.7. An example of this is the common Flu Vaccine. You don't get the same Flu vaccine each and every year...it varies with the types of flu strains.
5106	202166	LOLOLOLOLOL so I got this message from my job. I also have all three Covid-19 shots. The purpose of the vaccine is to reduce the symptoms of Covid-19, right? Why am I being told if I don’t show symptoms, I’m still expected to work and show up for my shifts until I show symptoms!?
5107	110464	"The truth on Corona virus vaccines  ""There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.""Why then is so much written about COVID vaccines?If a working vaccine is an unlikely event, then is it about the vaccine or something else?"
5108	112331	@TwitterLive Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
5109	108466	Done with #COVID19. Get a vaccine if you want, wear a mask if you want, but I’m going to do what I want. #feb1 #February2022 #covidover #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder #followthescience
5110	108850	If there is a vaccine soon, there is absolutely no way the Trump deserves ANY credit for it.The world is working together on this and he has fought science the entire time.And anyway, wouldn’t you rather see it distributed by a Biden administration?#COVID19
5111	108192	It’s Happening Guys, There’s No Way Kenyan Government Is Being Given Free Covid19 Vaccines In Thousands Later They Get Expired Just Because Nanii Refused To Get Vaccinated. You’ll Get The Jab By Force
5112	109377	"All the people whining they're not getting a vaccine because ""it's not approved"" will be whining that it was approved too fast, so they're not getting a vaccine.Just moving the goalposts. That's what they live for (at least till they get COVID because they didn't get a vaccine)"
5113	109651	So when are all these clever pharmaceutical companies going to produce a vaccine to the coronavirus. And before any clever clogs says not possible or wrong, the science has to come up with a solution
5114	108646	@DrOlufunmilayo My only question is , as it keeps mutilating does the present vaccine work also against the “upgraded” version of Covid19 or they have to find a different vaccine ?
5115	201946	Received first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine today.  Let's all conquer the #pandemic together. #COVID19 #COVID #CovidVaccine #COVID19Vaccine
5116	108146	@CopingMAGA @tortellinius My father refuses to get the COVID-19 vaccine because he is 100% convinced that it's plot to microchip every American with the mark of the beast.
5117	109526	What if this a hoax  where he gets covid is hospitalized and low and behold he tries this new miracle drug and is well within a week.There you go vaccine for covid before Nov.3!!
5118	109318	@EWErickson Honestly, that’s a part of it. The stock market likes stability, and they think they’ll get it with Yellin as Treasury Secretary. Plus the good news in a Covid-19 vaccine helped.

5120	110800	@LeonRDublin @ATschugguel @100trillionUSD Except you can't eradicate this virus even with a vaccine. It has animal reservoirs just like any coronavirus... It is here to stay like the common cold and flu. Proper treatments are the only option. This was never about your health or safety from a virus only control.🤷
5121	110177	Motherfuckers in my state are getting the coronavirus and thinking the vaccine will make them get autism.
5122	109549	@Togs100 @debbiebarnes66 After this vaccine there will still be covid rules. Safe distancing is here forever. Masks too. More vaccinations will follow. It’s a never ending ‘new normal’. Those who know that the vaccine does not (can not) protect against coronavirus will at least be healthy -if less free.
5123	112572	Got my first COVID-19 vaccine today! I'll keep y'all updated on how I'm doing but feeling good right now. Get a vaccine right now if you can to protect yourself and others.
5124	107929	Why do I need to get a booster? Genuine question #COVID19 how will it help Dot over the road? She's had hers so why do I need mine??? @BorisJohnson I've never even had a cold so I reckon I might be ok since I've had the vaccine I've lost all motivation to exercise. coincidence🤷🏻‍♂️
5125	112095	@johnaw19 @leeburgess1 @DrGABaines @JuliaHB1 You said there has never been a vaccine for a similar virus. That is untrue. Flu is a coronavirus.
5126	111140	Is it true that Pfizer's Coronavirus vaccine has to be injected in your bum five times in order for it to work?
5127	112297	It is OK to me, not listen my words. But bad humans may die no matter how. Even they have done vaccine for coronavirus. Most of English belonging to David, King. And he is very severe and honest. Bad man have no place to live on earth.

5129	112160	Lmao vaccines DO NOT keep you from getting something. They help you FIGHT it. AFTER you get it....stay home still.
5130	110729	Good, hopeful thread on vaccine expectations. The first ones might not confer immunity, just symptom reduction, but symptom-free infection could boost immunity. This means herd immunity via vaccine won't happen.
5131	108602	To celebrate getting my first #Pfizer vaccine! I’m going to stream some @PlayApex  tonight 🙂🙌🏻 @YouTubeGaming @YouTube!! Just going my part to be safe from #COVID19 @PlayStation

5136	112876	This is awful! If people who are eligible would just do there part and get vaccinated, things like this wouldn’t happen. We need to get people vaccinated, continuous testing isn’t going to end this like O’Toole thinks. We need mandatory vaccines!
5137	111392	The African Continent has been catered to in regard by China. It is.... Only... China that has supplied WHO approved Vaccines to the African Continent. Racism has shown itself in the African Continent. Humanity has farted on the face of Human Beings. Ugh (La Ugh)
5138	202299	Yikes. Both soon-to-be-available vaccines for Covid19 come with side effects: Covid19-like symptoms that may last a day or so. BUT, to be effective, one must return and receive a 2nd dose. Lots of questions just ran through my mind 😳. @CLupus63https://t.co/0Ec6l8RbRd
5139	112296	It's disappointing but I think making vaccines is probably kinda tricky, eh? I think we are better off being grateful for the miracles that we are getting and not act all super fucking entitled because there is a delay#covid19 #covid19ab
5140	111046	@NigelKellow @BethLynch2020 No at present there are 7 strains of COVID19,Is this vaccine a blanket for all 7 or just the common 2? I find no info about this.Is the vaccine one that provides lasting immunity or will this be the new flu shot, again no data, understandable since this is new but naw 3rd Round
5141	109416	I know this is a very stupid question but please clear this out for me. Can someone who turned 18 this year get a COVID-19 vaccine? because this person is literally making fun of me saying ‘18+ can get and I’m just 18’. I’m NOT DUMB but it’s confusing 🥺😂
5142	202290	@ddwlsdd @ABC Not surprised you would come back with a sad remark like that. Pro-choice say my body, my life etc, so how about YOU apply that to vaccines.  I never owned a machine gun and they are illegal anyway without a special permit. Do gays get the coronavirus? U are wasting my time now
5143	112434	Traitor trump...why is there a need for a vaccine for coronavirus when you told us “ it will just go away”?
5144	108450	The propaganda connected to their COVID-19 VACCINE became clear when they've said; 'people that have had #COVID19 already, can get it again.' But if you already have the COVID gene (antigen) in you, and they say you can get it again; then what good will their vaccine do. Its B$!
5145	111005	@BHRCSD The Coronavirus vaccine. The big pharma companies dont like Trump and waited till after the election to praise the vaccine. Biden will take credit for Trump's vaccine. Go figure!
5146	109174	@Debs_Kropotkin @DoubleA0317 @ADS21817949 @DrTomFrieden Vaccines prevent long Covid. No they might not stop it completely. But for me it’s enough that I am not worried about it.
5147	111193	The vaccine is around the corner, but we still need to be diligent in saving lives. Covid-19 has affected multiple people in my life, but recently it almost took a man that has been a father figure to me. Its also now touched on my immediate family and I have to be tested.

5152	108778	Just like you can’t drink alcohol if you are getting a liver transplant etc. it’s not that hard to get a vaccine. Plus if it IS for religious exemption, why is she trying to even get a transplant? #GetVaxxed

5154	112428	Well, the shortfalls are something we already know. It looks like I may not get my booster in May as stated on my Covid Vaccination Card after all.
5155	109742	So now you can’t even get herd immunity when everyone is immunized, bc then ppl wouldn’t need the constant boosters that will continue to rake in gvmt $$$ for Big Pharma.

5171	109443	@jahearthat @irishexaminer @griffinniamh This is why you should check with your doctor before getting a vaccine. Mine usually advises me against the flu vaccine due to the quirks of my immune system. I've yet to have that conversation with him about the covid-19 vaccine.

5183	107825	It's not even that, how in the hell did they developed COVID-19 vaccine in months and not for HIV and Cancer still????It's frustrating.
5184	109371	Don't be appalled. It's only logical since the first vaccines were made without the Delta variant in mind, for example. Flu shots get renewed each year as well. It's just how it is.
5185	108816	Who thinks going on a cruise with unvaccinated people is smart? They have enough trouble passing around sickness as it is. This is crazy. Get your vaccine people!
5186	108318	.Oh dear what can the matter be....i think ive got sepsis.... in my anatomy.....i wish i studied..... endocrinology..... and politely declined my flu jab.
5187	111104	Sorry he did that. Hope he has no complications. I will never take a vaccine for a virus with a 99.7% survival. I have an idea...how about working on a vaccine for something that is actually deadly!
5188	111459	I support wearing #facemasks 100%. However, I'm puzzled. The #vaccine will be less effective protection? How come? This is troubling news.
5189	111959	@elonmusk @AstroJordy @erujabidi It looks like a severe seasonal virus or sars which is a common coronavirus but obviously it is not covid.Treatment of seasonal virus &amp; sars is very different from covid treatment...A misdiagnosis is the worst!Trust your gut,your vibes!If DayQuil rocks,it's ok!✌️Get well soon!💕
5190	109044	Well pinhead Harris, Trump will not be the one that says the vaccine is safe. I’m sure the vaccine makers will be the ones who say when the vaccine is safe.
5191	202251	This is utter BS. Both my parents voted for Brexit and have had their first vaccine jab. I too voted for Brexit and will be more than happy to have the jab.Studies like these do nothing but sprea division through an already divided country.
5192	110412	"@LilithAssyria @Kevin_McKernan Afaik, they have never isolated the original Wuhan virus, but they have many times isolated the virus from probes taken out of patients directly. It grows in vitro.The problem no ""real virus"" coronavirus vaccine exists is ADE (Antibody dependent enhancement)"
5193	108807	Anti vaxxers have had enough time, it’s time that they show us their empirical facts/evidence/research as to why they don’t want the vaccine to protect themselves and those around them.
5194	111545	"Alright I've taken the ""third (second in my case) does"" of COVID-19 vaccine.  This time I've got the Pfizer. I'll say it once again. Please do vaccinate. It's the only way we can truly live normally again.#TeamPfizer"
5195	108319	@hrshta_k Makes sense, why would they apply when the vaccines are not destined to be used there. But I don’t see this will ever happen. They should just allow based on the confidence they have on the vaccine and how it works on COVID-19
5196	110408	@tannerkahler @WISN12News @GovEvers @ABC @ABCNewsLive There have been how many strains of COVID since it was first discovered in animals in the 1930s. Explain why in h. there has not been a single vaccine? Why is there no vaccine for the common cold since it is related to coronavirus strains? Corporate profits over public safety.
5197	109073	i had to get all my shots to go to school in 1990my brother had to get them in 1994 or maybe 1995.and my nephew had to get them last yearwe're hoping the covid19 vaccine for under 12s comes soon
5198	109123	@MikeMcLean123 @peterson1115 @GovBillLee I had the flu every year until I started getting the flu shot every year it works I am listening to the science I've gotten both shots for covid19 and I will get the flu shot next month and I will get a booster shot if the science tells me to my Drs said so!!
5199	112202	This is a negative piece of news but on the other hand it shows that their research is very serious and there is no doubt that when the vaccine is finally approved, it is going to be safe!
5200	107758	"@MattHancock I'm not anti vaccine far from it but seems to me that so far in Europe only totalitarian states R willing to inject vaccines prematurely to get PR benefit. "" they're  old &amp; will soon be dead anyway"".  NO doubt Trump would've the same if reelected. Shameful #RejoinEU"
5201	111628	It is official the country is screwed. When your vaccines Minister doesn't even know the order in which the months of the year run then you really do start to understand how this Government have made such a complete hash of their response to Covid19.
5202	112586	Of course this #virus was on purpose, it’s China testing the world. To see how we can cope , see how long it takes for us to get #COVID19  #vaccines . The next virus will be deadlier , Hey presto ! China controls the World
5203	108417	IF the #CovidVaccine works,IF #Masks works,IF all the measures by BIduMB work, then why the hell am I at home with #COVID19 ?My Grandfather has #Covid, my hubby, again #Covid, my Gen Z kid, #COVID19Get it RIGHT! #COVIDIOTS#GetVaccinatedNow 🤬🖕
5204	110820	i saw a tiktok on how the coronavirus vaccine works. they put covid rna in it so when it gets into your bloodstream a protein will make a cell with covid antigens and then your body is like hello stranger and starts making antibodies against it.
5205	108019	"Vaccines don't stop infection. None of them do, not one. They charge the immune system to fight an infection. You'd think all these useful idiots screaming ""Believe the ScIeNcE!!!"" might actually be interested in learning the science. #COVID19"
5206	112888	@cathynewman @marsh_jill @Channel4News Because it's a #FakePlague and they don't want you to find out! Falsified numbers! #Event201 Lockdown, masks, social distancing, tack and trace = #HUMANRIGHTSABUSE No Vaccine is needed for covid19. Prove me wrong.
5207	110498	This is what happens when you play the sorcerer's apprentice ... it's like with the vaccine today ...
5208	111014	@VictoriaSykes1 @AilsaJanePodMed Saw this convo and wanted to share this thread. It’s not surprising those on ocrevus like us have little to no B cell antibodies from vaccine but our T cells mount an effective response that is not measured in these antibodies tests.
5209	110895	@waynecooksys @crjmmm @ToddMey75011190 @Ross71700699 @leannewhelan8 COVID-19 vaccine is the best vaccine the world has ever seen, it's genius.. you have no idea really about how they made it. It's beyond anything we have ever done before. Ever.
5210	112250	Another NACI leak. I realize the advisory council has had communications issues, but I don’t get why this stuff is leaking, and how a leak is helpful for shoring up public trust around a vaccine that is already facing hesitancy.Also: NACI just cancelled today’s press conference
5211	109759	@Birds_WatArtThy @PrefectDreyfus @FamilyTrumpGolf @KiingAP12 @Josh112214 @donutrolls15 or a vaccine &amp; good treatment. we don't know enough about the long-term effects of COVID-19 but what we do know is it's bad and can lead to life-long damages to your body.hopefully, when you get COVID-19 you're actually immune for years after but we don't know that for certain.
5212	111076	It's only midday and my brain is already hurting from the Covid-19 conspiracy theorists#microchip#markofthedrvil#billgates#dnachangevaccineStrangely enough, the twats have given up on the 5G theory.
5213	111817	@LizClaman It’s laughable to think with the vaccine progress made by Pfizer, Moderna, and Oxford that anyone will need a vaccine by @PeterHotez- plus given how little support this will get relative to OWS his best hope for real shots in arms is mid-2022
5214	111394	So why should kids get the vaccine if this virus gives them no symptoms?? Most didn’t even get a fever!!
5215	108119	These claims are because there seems to be 2 Pfizer vaccines.This is partly true. The vaccine will be delivered in 2 different packagings, 1 that is branded, “Comirnaty,” and 1 called Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The actual vaccine in either package is EXACTLY the same.
5216	109075	Soon they'll be shooting and killing anyone not taking their stupid vaccines. They are just preparing us.
5217	111241	@DearAuntCrabby I won't be taking any vaccine because I did my research this covid19 is being survived by 98% of those who contract it not mentioning viruses aren't really good candidates to be vaccinated against as they mutate quickly
5218	107988	@JNJNews @gatesfoundation #JNJ please give an update on how the #COVID19 vaccine trials are going? $JNJ
5219	109788	#vaccine doctors don’t know if it prevents the spread and infection only symptoms. I am not going to be forced to vaccinate my children!
5220	110468	#COVID19  coronavirus vaccine   Covid-19. A process that normally takes years, if not decades, has been whittled down to months. 🤔 @rtenews #rtept #TonightVMTV #cblive #twip 🤔
5221	112780	Ground breaking research work is going on in Ashoka University. This is as good as inventing a vaccine against Covid19. Amita Baviskar must be one hell of an 'intellectual'.
5222	110803	This pandemic will not be over until it’s over for everyone, everywhere. I’m calling on @Novavax to pledge their commitment to making sure the COVID-19 vaccine is distributed fairly and equitably around the world. #OneWorldProtected
5223	110467	+ALL immediately go to anti #inflammation #diet, especially no #sugar #processedfood or #alcohol + almost everyone who gets it will #survive #covid!  Can flatten curve in days, 2 wks tops!  not months or years it will take govts of world to get vaccine to us all! #ReOpen!❤️ #Fred
5224	111621	We’d like to clarify an earlier post with apologies for any misunderstanding caused. We’re extending the coronavirus vaccine to all staff providing intimate personal care for learners with complex medical needs in special schools, schools and colleges.
5225	109779	Why third and fourth when there is treatment. They said. If you take 2 dose pfz,  you are safe, then second lie you may get infected but mild. Then why third booster? Time to ponder.
5226	110907	@v_cassiere @waltshaub Follow Covid-19 precautions, encourage others to do do, get flu vaccine as soon as possible encourage others to do so, volunteer (if able to safely) for voter registration efforts, polling locations, peaceful protests, research what's needed locally and engage as best you can.
5227	109449	Sounds like child abuse to me… way to go (mom) when he gets sick you will beg for the vaccine to be pulled right?…….
5228	109210	@Textingdaddy @julie44627826 @Reuters Hate to break it to you but the common flu could have been wiped out with everyone getting a flu #vaccine, but here we are 80 years later with the flu running a muck every year. #COVID19 is most here to stay. It’s estimated that 30% of the population won’t get the vaccine.
5229	111039	@KENS5 All of my immediate family has had the coronavirus. Those with the vaccine all contracted the coronavirus they received the shot for immunity.
5230	109829	@JaggerMickOZ Nowhere in this document is there any mention of responses to ‘no jab no job.  Rather, the sentiment is to augment the frontline workers who are burdened by the rapid rise in Covid-19 cases in VIC.  If this augmentation covers some staff resigning, so be it. Nothing sensational.
5231	110510	@cendanannie I have already received my first vaccination jab against COVID-19 and am waiting for my second.
5232	107978	👇🏼check out this clip from my conversation with @FadiaTVNews regarding our work to get the #CovidVaccine to the #homeless population of Tampa! @usf_tbsm @USFHealthMed @USFHealth #MedTwitter #EndHomelessness
5233	202276	If you got the vaccine over 2 weeks ago the CDC considers you unvaccinated... So Welcome back to the gang
5234	202076	I got my first Covid-19 vaccine last week and I was incredibly impressed with the system established at the Dayton Convention Center. They were professional and quickly administered the vaccine. Hats off to all working there. Covid-19 Vaccination #SW5602
5235	109015	It was getting made before the virus back in January  and before that so they knew  what was happening so who is making money on this vaccine
5236	110862	@FredeckyB1 By treating it like a real pandemic, mask protocols, shutdowns, social distancing,  they work broadly for any virus, just because there isn't a specific to this virus solution doesn't mean there isn't a solution, also coronavirus vaccines were in development before the pandemic
5237	110307	@OutdoorCrypto @MadDogCoops @JoeyAnselmini @schadnfr @Rover829 @niro60487270 He’s too stupid to realize they’re using MERS strains to find a vaccine for the new coronavirus or any other
5238	112689	"News of ""deadly"" British variant overshadowed by the ""terrifying"" SA variant which could make short work of all vaccines? Why does this feel like a #GroundhogDay where they keep looking for an ""African"" variant = Deadliest of them all. Isn't this just the British one going home?"
5239	111082	damn what happened to the mink coronavirus? I know they culled minks in a lot of European countries because of the mutation that makes vaccines less effective against it. Is the mink coronavirus strain really gone? It could show up in the US like the UK variant.
5240	108780	@EliseVelaz9 @busdriverlife I was contemplating this, but then I realized that about half of the vaccines we’ve ever had, I have no idea how severe the disease would be. These dieseases barely register In my brain. I’d like COVID-19 to be that way for the next generation.
5241	109459	Just dropped my folks off to get their vaccine! Couldn’t be happier! I caught Covid back in September but never passed it on to them even though we all live in the same house! No idea how that happened! #COVID19 #COVIDVaccination
5242	108241	"@EvanAKilgore MILLIONS have already tested ""positive"" for covid19 so WHY would they need a vaccine for a virus they have already had?🤔"
5243	109415	Still playing the game with a psi virus orchestrated to destroy America and the Republic.. Too bad you did not get off your asses and expose this psi virus. The so called vaccine is a kill shot poison. No so bright lady!
5244	112078	if you’re a trump supporter or were out there rioting at the us capital do not worry about what’s in the coronavirus vaccine
5245	107993	@readthinkwalk @CarnoustieC @campbellclaret They had the luxury of low national debt (20% GDP), which they will be more than doubling to pay for their support measures (to 54% GDP by 2023). What happens if, like every other coronavirus-like virus to date, we don’t get a vaccine ever? 2 week quarantine forever?
5246	111376	@POTUS Hey Lame Brain! US or the World will never get out of Covid19 with an ineffective Vaccine that does not protect against Variants. Your crazy Government overreach against Constitution will go down in history Crazy Authoritarianism will destroy #Democrats
5247	109636	Based on the historical failures of past coronavirus vaccines, a fast-tracked COVID-19 vaccine could become one of the biggest public health disasters in history. And, no one involved is accountable or will face any repercussions. Instead, they will all profit. #Covid_19
5248	110908	So u got the #Covid19 #vaccine - yay! Did u know some ppl won't mount an immune response? How do u know if you did? Get ur #antibodies tested! Simple finger stick  test looks 4 expected response 2 #vaccination. Call 404-702-3009 #covidtesting #COVID19 #covid #covidvacccine
5249	107871	@essenviews No my favorite was its COVID-19 so they've had 18 chances to get a vaccine (paraphrase) 🤯🤯🤯🤯
5250	111763	Justice. — Anyone too stubborn and dense to get a vaccine really has no business being around sick patients. Period.
5251	108113	I almost want to ask these people how did they expect this pandemic to end if not for a vaccine? Did they think coronavirus would get tired of humans &amp; just leave on its own. The fuck.
5252	201944	Quite a number of my friends in the #NHS contacted me today to confirm they have received their first Pfizer vaccine this week. They had to wait 15 mins after the vaccination in case their is a allergic reaction. Well done to the staff at @uhbtrust #Covid19 #CovidVaccine
5253	108288	Today I got my first jab of the Moderna covid19 vaccine. I get the next one in 28 days which will be during an extended Spring Break (school planned in a 2 week quarantine period).
5254	109447	@FoxNews One lab rat says to the other: “So are you going to take the Covid-19 vaccine?”The other lab rat responds: “Are you kidding me?! They’ve not even finished testing it on humans yet”
5255	110022	@StopNewNormal The magical vaccine again that ignores the uncomfortable truth.- We've never developed one for a coronavirus- They normally take 10 years to be safe- No 100% effective (Flu is ~30%)- It'll be over before we need it. No-one has a Spanish flu vaccine (it's not needed).
5256	108629	@dicey_armaney @POTUS Why do you think un vaccinated people don't take covid-19 seriously? That's a bit presumptuous.  Perhaps some are afraid the vaccine will actually kill them because they are very immuno-compromised. Food for thought
5257	111625	@Jenkinsonn3 no. i don't think the vaccines are 100% safe either, but covid really is so dangerous, especially when it comes to collapsing healthcare systems, that they're a necessary, or atleast i hope so. i also believe covid19 was an accident.
5258	110062	@DailyMirror Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
5259	109679	Hard pass on this nonsense. My daughter will never take this, especially when her risk is so minimal there's greater danger for her just driving to school.#NoVaccineMandates #NoMasks #BackToNormal
5260	108647	Same on her! What a horrible, selfish act. Discrace to the human race. This behavior needs to be punished!  What about the senior who dies after her vaccine theft because they could not get an apoointment.  What if Ms griffith had instead helped just 1 senior get an appointment?
5261	110965	@superscuba83 @Mrs_Thomas82 Don’t lose hope. It’s a cold virus, not flu, so not expected to mutate as freq. Science have never moved this quickly towards creating a successful vaccine for Coronavirus as colds are generally mild, &amp; previous outbreaks of sars covid fizzled out.
5262	109321	Vaccination is a step towards ending the COVID-19 limitations, why are they protesting against vaccination? If they don’t want to, they don’t have to take it. There is no vaccine against stupidity!
5263	111360	when it comes to Any vaccination if its not 100% effective it is worthless, Even if they come out with a Coronavirus Vaccine, IF i am not sick from the coronavirus, Nobody is sticking me with Any vaccinations that are not 100% effective! Doing so to #people=We are Not Guinea pigs
5264	112466	@OliviuG @LaloDagach The vaccine originally being developed for SARS (SARS-CoV-1) is now being used as the basis for a vaccine for the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
5265	109714	@FactsMathLogic Well after the peak of h1n1 they developed a vaccine. These are two different pandemics. Fact is there was immunities older folks had that others didnt. This one no one has immunity or antibodies it is a novel coronavirus.
5266	202431	My guess was at least 80% of each community sub-group, so I guess I was (unfortunately) pretty close.  #CovidVaccine
5267	109105	There was life before the #coronavirus and life after the #coronavirus until science find a vaccine and a way to get ppl who recovered and still test positive rid of the virus.
5268	111833	@BBCBreakfast It looks like the EU is going ahead with blocking of Covid-19 vaccines? This just shows what hold the EU Commission has on its members as quite a few of them were against these moves. They are only doing this because the UK has left the Union and that we are so far
5269	111323	Another way the Dems are dictating to us. No vaccine, no job, no income to punish us for not obeying their laws 😡 Why aren't our Repub reps fighting back??? 😡 Are they part of the Deep State manuevering us to their NWO??? 😡😡😡
5270	111622	The conspiracy nuts won’t take vaccine because they think @BillGates is tracking them..... I wonder how they feel about this one....
5271	107797	"@Gurdur Not sure Ioannidis is irrelevant even now. The idea that COVID-19 is ""like the flu"" is still out there and is being used to stoke vaccine hesitancy. Not all his fault, but he unintentionally contributed to it."
5272	111591	*internally screams* This calendar is SO CUTE!!!! Okay, this, along with scheduling my appointment for my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine for next Friday, just made my day!
5273	112414	@VincentCrypt46 Yup... actually I think I had COVID-19 ... wasn’t fun but I would rather get it again then take a vaccine.
5274	110360	Sorry!! Nope I will pass on this!! If you had this virus you don't need the vaccine. So therefore no vax for this chic.
5275	111836	How to say nothing by saying something, if you recognize our vaccine, why then do we still need to isolate after two tests declaring us negative?
5276	202285	Good news! My parents got their first Pfiizer dose last Monday in St Catharines; booster scheduled for July 5. #onpoli #pandemic #COVID19
5277	111770	"Covid-19 isn't a hoax. The hoax is THIS; ""the only way to control it is a vaccine."" The vaccine is one way. there are other cures. The media and Government has convinced us that the only way to control its spread is the vaccine. THIS IS A LIE."
5278	111351	What you fail to understand is that people will get sick either way. Your suggestion that we close everything down until the vaccine is distributed(which can take another year) People will get sick the best we can do is get as many vaccines and also up our hospital capacity.
5279	108560	This makes me wonder. @realDonaldTrump gave endless briefings about ventilators. And we come to find out they weren’t necessary. In fact whistleblowers said they were actually killing people! Is the vaccine truly the new ventilator? Will it go unused because it’s dangerous? 🤔
5280	112344	@normanswan Israel refused to grant the Coronavirus vaccine to the Palestinian prisoners in the occupation prisons
5281	109777	@EdTufexis @JKPreachersgirl The *scientific twitter experts* are saying it could be the stronger symptoms some are having may indicate they would have had more severe Coronavirus. Doesn't make sense to me, *pretend twitter science expert*, because there is no coronavirus in the vaccine.
5282	108213	@PattyD_2020 @BALLERINAPRO @conservmillen Covid-19 vaccine prevents acquiring or spreading airborne viruses. You can’t, it doesn’t exist. If you want to live your life in your happy little bubble go ahead, just don’t stomp on might right not to.
5283	109927	If covid19 is really sensitive to summer heat, I am sure people will do whatever they can to postpone winter as much as they can, even if it took them to burn down all forests and open all factories or release every single carbon dioxide molecule. Vaccine will save us and Earth!
5284	110254	@tentacle_tattoo that’s kind of my thinking, the worst thing the vaccine can do is give you coronavirus (even tho it doesn’t actually contain the virus but let’s just assume dumb shit)but you could also get coronavirus, which will do all the same stuff but 100x worse
5285	110727	My #COVID19 #vaccine card is now squeezed in to my wallet between my Greggs and Starbucks loyalty cards. Which is most valuable?
5286	112118	We can social distance all we want, but the Feds keep shipping in Covid like it’s a vaccine.The Brazil variant came from somewhere.  On something.  In someone.How dumb are we?  Are we @PattyHajdu stupid?  Is that even possible?#CdnCovid

5288	112866	@lucrezianews @itvlondon Hi Lucrezia 😀 Hope everything is ok with you. I'm so happy because my 84yr old Grandad gets his Covid19 vaccine on Monday! 😀 Take care Lucrezia. 👍😀 #CovidVaccine
5289	202312	Damn that was a close call I hid needles filled with the vaccine in all my Halloween Candy this year.
5290	111580	Same. There isnt a snowballs chance in hell I am putting a vaccine in my body that has been shoved through the system. If folks want to line up for it knowing that covid has a 99.98% survival rate as is, then knock yourselves out. Im gonna keep exercising and eating healthy.
5291	109903	The new strains of the virus spreading across Europe and US will have devastating effect on the countries without access to vaccine. And eventually it will comes back to hurt us all. #Covidiots are going to make this #Pandemi go on forever with their short sighted stupidity.

5295	202146	"Was that decided by ""who"" and what conspiracies was he paranoid about? When I shared that I got my vaccine, my close friend shared she believes the COVID-19 vaccine is putting microchips promoted by Gates and Left-wing POLITICIANS. She only watches Newsmax, Fox, &amp; Breitbart.NUTZ"
5296	110784	These same people seem not to realize that we do not have vaccines for ANY, of the past pandemics, not H1N1, not AIDS (which is a Coronavirus). What idiot thinks wearing masks and social distancing is going to go on indefinitely? I still say it all goes away, Nov 4th.
5297	202114	Have my second coronavirus vaccine shot scheduled Saturday..  It seems the Department of Justice will not give me due process in Calgary, Alberta due to scandal..  Just this afternoon the plaistering spies that bothered me in the Spring of 2020 moved into the containment chamber~
5298	110451	How come no PLA officers died due to #CoronaVirus? Reason. They had a vaccine. And, Xi, Tedros lied to the world.

5301	201999	Awesome day today having a delayed #CanadaDay BBQ outdoor get together with some of our neighbours. Everyone has at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, some (myself, yay!) have both doses. Looking forward to when us fully vaccinated get back to normal in British Columbia.
5302	112482	Is it true the AstraZeneca Oxford #COVID19 vaccine is not being tested against an inert placebo but against a meningococcal vaccine?Why? Because it hides side-effects.
5303	202388	Fully fully vaxxed (2 weeks after my second dose today) with nearly 12,000 lovely COVID-19 antibodies. Definitely feeling much freer now and not using my sanitiser every 5 mins to the point that my hands go all dry, flaky, &amp; horrible.Yes to freedom and yes to the vaccines 🙌🏻 https://t.co/ozti6mJqsS
5304	112486	@Godnose @fragrantfeline @ClarkeMicah there's no vaccine against the common cold, another coronavirus, but they tell us they can rush one through that'll defo work and be safe.
5305	109500	@nytimes China only stamped out the coronavirus on their fake report. Without the cure, without the vaccine, there's no way to stamp the virus out. If you are positive but asymptomatic there, you're not counted as a confirmed case.
5306	111557	@Blacklace40 The only way I'll consent to a vaccination is when I see the effects of the vaccine on white people like you because I'm not about to be a guinea pig. My fear is  due to COVID-19 impacting Blk Ppl in high percentages, they'll use us as test subjects. I'll pass. It'll be a while
5307	112585	This is something logical, but is government going to wait till vaccine developed? or what would be the strategy to maintain minimum speading of virus.#lcokdown has shown us complete failure of administration control so far.#SpeakUpIndia #coronavirus @ndtv @MoHFW_INDIA
5308	112706	Got my second covid-19 vaccine. Countdown started until my two weeks are done. Woo hoo!#covid19 #CovidVaccine
5309	108354	I believe in vaccination for poor countries. But I’m honestly sick of seeing these articles already. It’s 💯 ethical for countries that developed the vaccines to provide it to their populations first. If in 6 months poor countries aren’t getting it then I will be upset.
5310	112390	The spread in India is absolutely gnarly. The juxtaposition of everyone getting vaccines here, and the rapid spread there is crazy. #mavorg
5311	111748	One nation in the world has decided to use Covid-19 and vaccines as a weapon, it'll come as no surprise to find out who it is.
5312	108494	@berniespofforth I'm not a vegan.My vaccines are all up-to-date.My kids' vaccines are all up-to-date.I will take a COVID19 vaccine as soon as it is made available to me (I'm moderate risk as I am 50 and had lymphoma a few years back).Anyone that doesn't take vaccines is an entitled cunt IMO.
5313	110501	If you want to understand how something will play out in the future, all you need to do is look into the past.Current #Covid19 vaccines don't reportedly prevent infections, only lower the severity of symptoms and complications if you get it. #VirusTheater NPIs are here to stay.
5314	108834	"@CDCFlu the ""#coronavirus"" is a lie. There is no pandemic. Only the ""flu""-""vaccine"" causes the ""flu"". Eat broccoli every month, one whole crown, and you will never get sick. Brochitis is only possible for lack of fresh raw green vegetables, and being exposed to insects and dirt."
5315	110378	Gonna get the vaccine then immediately head to the nearest karaoke bar to sing Shania Twain’s That Don’t Impress Me Much
5316	201841	As a side note... YESTERDAY I GOT MY FIRST COVID-19 VACCINE SHOT! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Hell yeah! https://t.co/JVrYcXi5Fl
5317	111801	This public service announcement is just for those who are on the fence, didn’t turn up for their appointment  because they are waiting for a “better” one : Don’t wait. Don’t compare vaccine brands.Get whatever comes first. Cases are going up. So are mortality rates.
5318	202419	Seriously though, the benefits outweigh the down time for a quick jab. Get vaccinated today! #COVID19 #vaccine
5319	111259	@fourscoreand6 @JennaEllisEsq Meh, the vaccine has done nothing to save lives, and those who dont take it are no more or less a risk to others who do take it.there is no vaccine for coronavirus. If there was we would have cured the common cold.
5320	110252	@muffnbear We need scientists to work overtime to create a vaccine for this so the antivaxxers worried about coronavirus can not take it.
5321	112846	"@mtracey @jakemerci lol, omg, says a face diaper wearing zombie who will be first in line for the ""coronavirus"" vaccine 😹"
5322	110235	@WalshFreedom Why can one person take an aspirin and another person can Not take aspirin?But! Everyone can take the covid-19 vaccines?Please explain? If you can?
5323	109718	Channel 3 in Thailand is reporting a Thai doctor has found a cure for Novel Coronavirus. It says he uses 3 vaccines:  1. Oseltamivir. This vaccine for MERS  2. Lopinavir This for AIDS  3. Ritonavia. For AIDS #journalism #Health #Wuhan #China # #media #Thailand #Coronavirus
5324	111088	This is most likely propaganda but even if it wasn’t, why wouldn’t you just share vaccine information so everyone can have it? People are dying.
5325	112606	In my view, there is a lot of fear among Christians masquerading as prudence or caution, especially as it relates to COVID-19 and the vaccines. David’s declaration is good advice today: “When I am afraid, I will trust in you.” (Psalm 56:3)
5326	110119	No. They don't work against Covid. The vaccines are the reason we have variants happening. Our immune systems could wipe out COVID-19 in time.
5327	108812	Mandates are not laws. Why this vaccine and none of the others? Chickenpox, Influenza, hepatitis, etc? Why not all vaccines in order to work? What is so special about this one? If you can still get and spread #COVID19. All the other vaccines work! Mandates are not laws.
5328	111329	Why on earth wasn’t this publicized? Seems like a great PSA opportunity for vaccines, especially when 56% of Republicans won’t or are unsure about getting vaccine.
5329	112389	@ed_hooven @NBSaphierMD Like I said, you clearly don't understand how vaccines work. If you did you'd understand ppl who have had covid19 don't need a vaccine.
5330	110688	The Market is acting as if Intramuscular #COVID vaccines are all we need - this year perhaps / next year the nasal route will eliminate the need for mask wearing in those taking $ALT vaccine - strategic advantage.
5331	109292	@Breaking911 Why the rush to vaccinate so many people with an experimental vaccine when most of us have this thing called an immune system &amp; if your healthy you will beat the coronavirus on your own. There are also CURES aka therapeutics- so vaccines are not needed, ppl need to wake up.
5332	109745	I am fully vaccinated. But an injection the WHO needed to change the definition of “vaccine” for is actually no vaccine!!! #Booster #coronavirus #virus #COVID19 #Impfstoff #vaccine
5333	111785	Please @PramilaJayapal tell me again how great unions are. We pulled our kids out of SPS because it couldn't handle Covid. We're going to an independent school where vaccine and masks are mandated. We're lucky we can afford this option. Most cannot. But unions.
5334	111273	@Telegraph Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
5335	111971	If a vaxxed person can get covid, and spread covid, then why would it be so important for healthcare workers to be vaxxed???
5336	107951	@Elisabe88429520 @JeremyVineOn5 @dr_simon @theJeremyVine Im not worried about the planed covid19 never have been the vaccines don't work the booster is to make money off us they admitted it. It's funny how there's another v just before Christmas just like last Christmas where they lied l seen it coming months ago.
5337	109638	Rapid testing is no panacea. LTC workers need to take the vaccine as condition of employment. @DrFullertonMPP, @TBayMOH, @DrBarbYaffe, @fordnation, @epdevilla, @JohnTory
5338	111638	@RobertWilcher @allergic2da @defitillidie @libsoftiktok Why then has there NEVER been any vaccine for a coronavirus EVER?? This one is a huge FAIL
5339	111338	If a #vaccine is to expose us to a virus in hopes our bodies create antibodies, then wouldn't our bodies already be doing this now assuming most of us have been in contact with the #virus?Therefore, why do we need a vaccine? #COVID19 #COVIDIOTS
5340	110555	@EricAlanHanson @skilletmusic @ChrisHohnholz Also that's not what skillet is saying at all. They are saying they want the venue to give you a choice of either one, but this place in KC wants everyone vaccinated. Skillet just wants you to either have the vaccine or show a negative COVID-19 test
5341	109960	@SergeyEinstein I'd just blackmail Bill Gates for them, he's got the vaccine for the CoronaVirus 🤷‍♂️
5342	110216	My security company contacted me to sign up for the Covid-19 vaccine so I did... Whenever I am called to schedule the appointment I will keep a diary of what my experience was from the first and second shot 👍
5343	110314	This would be huge. So many vets have underlying medical conditions - this ensures our veteran population is not overlooked in the vaccine rollout.
5344	109764	@GeraldoRivera I recovered from COVID-19 GeraldoThere's absolutely no scientific reason for me get any vaccine ever Why are you so hush about this fact it's science and a fact Instead you clowns keep pushing a vaccine on people who don't need them
5345	108155	@punditclass This is not the flu.  The reason why? Because if you get COVID-19 there is a chance you could have severe outcomes either short term (death) I guess natural immunity would not matter in this case, or long term. Both more severe than the vaccine.
5346	109431	@wanthiskookaine @MrMcChicken22 @travisyost @washingtonpost A virus can weaken but it doesn’t have to. CoVid-19 is a novel virus but flu sometimes mutates to become deadly (except that we have vaccines to mitigate the risk and spread). Even if the bits of science were strung together in a truthful way…the timeline would still be unknown
5347	111155	@QuestionEvery31 @3Hams1 @choo_ek Your logic is broken. Between 81% and 96% of recent coronavirus patients requiring in-patient care received no COVID-19 vaccine or are only partially vaccinated. They’re not overwhelming our health care system yet, but they prob will soon
5348	110540	@praecipice @AndySwan @YossiGestetner @RonColeman At this point, yes. Maybe better vaccines will come along that are sterilizing for SARS-CoV-2, but that's not likely for any coronavirus. The vaccines are now 100% leaky. Hell, in my province, you have fewer chances to get COVID now by 30% if you are unvaccinated.
5349	112600	@IngrahamAngle I said earlier, how come China with the world's largest population has had fewer Covid-19 infections than Chicago?  Jeez, are they lying about it or did they have a vaccine in place before they released the virus on the world? Asking for a friend in Wuhan.
5350	110484	@senatemajldr Mitch please.Politicians have NOTHING 2 do with a vaccine. Scientists created it, not republicans. And you've got some nerve talking about baselessly undermining science. U enabled Trump 2 do JUST THAT since covid-19 started. Not 2 mention u don't believe in climate change...
5351	111337	No one is safe until everyone is safe   When you get the chance, take the vaccine.  Thank you UKG and Oxford AstraZeneca.
5352	110758	@AndrewBartlett So if the employee is unvaxxed, they could potentially sue the employer if they caught #COVID19 in the workplace, as the employer had a duty of care to protect them. Sometimes laws have to be made to protect people from their own stupidity, like safety goggles and hard hats.
5353	107939	Can we all stop being fake outraged over members of our govt getting the #CovidVaccine already?  Is it a dick hypocritical move to be an #antimasker #COVID19 downplaying vaccine getter? Yes. They are govt though and if them getting it encourages their constituents, good! Move on!
5354	112011	Just imagine when the vaccine comes out. The right will protest that too. These idiots are the reason why cases go up and we can't get out of this mess. the curfew is 10pm-5am. what would you be doing anyway?
5355	108520	Medicines and vaccines should NOT be accessible to the wealthy only! It is imperative for us all to stand up to the unjust system that has created this model.Enough is enough! #NoCOVIDMonopolies
5356	111113	Why do we call it a “coronavirus vaccine” and not “Big Tony Fauci’s World-Famous Classic Brooklyn Style Coronavirus Cure Juice”
5357	107705	@dee62140050 @GandalfIf @AishaMD_ @bradleybernie55 And when We say- Coronavirus is statistically identical to a Flu mortality rateThey scream - Grandma is dying you fascistWe say- there is support medicine for coronavirus patientsThey say- NO only a vaccine can save us!
5358	112420	@clairlemon @JDHaltigan Omg if you even listen to them they've BEEN vaxxed against all kinds of things in the past. It is the novel-vaccine against the novel-coronavirus they're skeptical of. GIVE IT A REST.
5359	110125	I hope what we may be seeing with Omicron is #ADE It’s going to happen eventually, so we may as well get it over with before anyone else suffers the consequences #COVID19 #vaccine …everyone was warned…
5360	109122	@cfrizz99 @wrstlrboy03 @HugS86 @AchatGBA We can if it’s not the first coronavirus. We’ve had vaccine technology for similar viruses in the work since 2011. With all the funding, we were able to develop and release a vaccine quicker not because it isn’t tested, but because we can skip all the legal stuff
5361	112909	Question to you is how long u gonna wait like this? Is the human life on earth will be dependent on one vaccine (profit for Pharma co) after another? Or we wish to defeat it by inherent immune sys?
5362	111702	I’m gonna start building my bunker and stock up essentially with bows and arrows and baked beans and carrots(for good night vision) while numpties keep gettin jabbed til they all become the zombie apocalypse disguised as COVID-19 🍻
5363	108199	I live in NY and had covid in Cabo last summer. Pretty scary when they talked ventilator We may as well get the vaccine because you won’t be able to do anything without it soon.
5364	111914	Challenge to all my fellow healthcare workers who have already received the vaccine:  speak out and demand an urgent vaccine campaign for people living in shelters, encampments, homeless people.  It is our moral obligation.
5365	202399	With the Covid-19 Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine arriving in Kenya tomorrow, given a chance, would you get vaccinated?
5366	112043	This is good news the care workers and n h s and the armed forces and the rest of us who don’t want the experiment vaccine should be free to choose  if we want it
5367	110939	An allergist diagnosed me as being in top 5% of allergy patients, globally. Might my immune system overreact to the upcoming Covid-19 vaccine? #CNNTownHall
5368	202392	First vaccine yesterday and feeling the wrath of it 🥶 Completely worth it though and looking forward to my second! 💪🏻 Very grateful to work for @DelphiMedical #OxfordVaccine #COVID19 https://t.co/HYvMnYf5pX
5369	111496	Something tells me that if a vaccine is ever developed for coronavirus Jenny McCarthy will be clamouring to get it. I firmly believe that anti-vaxxers should be actively discriminated against and be the very last in the queue.
5370	108660	So Putin’s daughter has taken a vaccine for the #WuhanVirus, so I’m rushing out to get in line?? 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Ain’t Happening!!
5371	107891	Celebrated my 6-month mark at @uabmedicine today by getting to see the face of someone who found out they were chosen to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The days are long, and this pandemic is tough, but a moment like that make it worth it.
5372	109037	A PEC Open editorial is one of the fastest ways to get a health economic idea out there. In this case a economic framework for efficiently and fairly allocating a COVID-19 vaccine. What normally takes months took days due to efficient handling of our manuscript by @ApplHealthEcon
5373	112108	So my birthday is in late February and if Covid goes on as I think it willI will have spent my entire 17th year of life in quarantine 🥰🥰#fuckCOVID #fuckTrump #fuck2020 #2020sucks #COVID19 #COVIDSecondWave #COVIDThirdWave #canwegetavaccinealready #WearADamnMask #fuckKarens
5374	107755	Lmaoooo wtf? If a vaccine works on a non black person why wouldn’t it work on a black person since we have the same biology? Do you think we’re dumb? You are not going to trick us into being your rats.
5375	112224	@angie_rasmussen @BogusLobster When you have healthcare for all then you're going to get a country that is going to treat its citizens with the utmost respect and everyone will get the covid-19 vaccine. The US should be ashamed of itself. The US needs to have Healthcare for all and free vaccines for all.
5376	110684	@rongejman I agree, but there hasn't been a global effort like this to work on a vaccine for one virus since maybe polio. Also, we know that it is possible to make vaccines for coronaviruses in general. See Merck's canine coronavirus vaccine.
5377	111803	🤣 And all the mask addicts will STILL get the vaccine, STILL wear the mask and STILL obey the lockdowns.  You see where they're going with this?  Anyone continuing to follow these mandates are suckers.
5378	110127	@EthonRaptor @leahstokes Wife can't have vaccine.  I will test 1st. Someone else may need it. Don't want to deny them if I don't need it.  Have has over 20 exposures, may have had mild case. Or, I may be in the approx 1/3 who have immunity because of coronavirus cold.
5379	109769	A Russian health care regulator has become the first in the world to approve a vaccine against the coronavirus, President Vladimir V. Putin said, though the vaccine has yet to complete clinical trials.
5380	109289	@globalnews I will likely wait to see. This will be an extremely rushed vaccine with little to no testing as normally required. Plus there has yet to be a successful vaccine for any previous coronavirus strain (SARS, MERS) so how have they suddenly come up with one now?
5381	110430	"""HoW diD tHeY FiNd tHe vAcCiNe iN 9 MoNtHs""It's because the coronavirus isn't a new virus and research over its family has been taking place ever since 2003."
5382	110936	Took my parents to get their 1st COVID-19 vaccines tonight. I’m really impressed with the set up out here. Easy, efficient, &amp; quick. Thanks to all the great volunteers! #COVID19vaccines #COVIDVaccination #VaccinesSaveLives
5383	111549	@Ramshaofficial Please don't do it.  1.  It is not a vaccine.  It is an RNA modifier which will change your bodies reaction to the next coronavirus exposure,  possibly creating a cytokine storm (an autoimmune response where your bodies defense system attacks the body).
5384	109162	@FT I read the article as isn’t proven that the vaccine will actually work. “The negotiations came as an international battle escalates among rich countries to buy up coronavirus remedies, often long before their effectiveness has been confirmed”.
5385	110411	@CBSNews Gas crisis but all this man talks about is Covid-19 everyone already know we got vaccine if they want to get it they will, cases are going down deaths are down. He talked about Uber and Lyft helping with vaccine how they gonna do that with no gas.
5386	111012	@cmsub sorry but it’s still not going to work at this point i’m happy that i didn’t take that vaccine . never even had covid-19 i been sick but nothing like covid only a cold i live in san diego it got cold this pass year but don’t take a test don’t take the vaccine it’s not worth it

Not THE coronavirus, not SARS-CoV-2. The patent I've seen is to an attenuated virus. You could look up that term. That patent concerns a vaccine against a coronavirus in poultry.
5388	110112	@JustinSchonie @LulawooBee @DrZweliMkhize I just took my child for immunisation a few weeks back. But I promise you, my family and I are not getting any rushed, unproven covid vaccine. And why are governments giving suppliers of COVID-19 vaccines indemnity against liability? What are they afraid of that we don't know?
5389	109600	i remember her in another lifetimeshe is the one “associated” with the D vaccine, right🤔i am interested finding out, her “moral ascendancy” in making her prescription, now.
5390	108788	@MacAndSwiss So actually the vaccine has part of the covid-19 virus in it. It enters your body and then it kills it.
5391	202250	I got the results of my COVID-19 test: Negative! Now I've got to get my 1st shot of vaccine this month.
5392	108764	Do these gigantic companies requiring this BS passport realize how much business they are going to LOSE? There's a lot of people out here who have no intention of taking the jab...But if they don't want me I don't want them. Lots of companies to boycott-Need to make a spreadsheet

5403	108587	I have no plans to get the vaccine. I’ve already had coronavirus and I’m a healthy 20 year old, the virus poses no risk to me. I’m a big believer in strengthening your immune system and I will not be taking a vaccine for a virus that affected me like a bad cold.
5404	111154	These Jihadi apologists don't think before abusing anyone.Patanjali's ayurvedic vaccine is already under trial.....
5405	111136	That SCUMBAG Bill Gates holds most of the stock in Pfizer. Of course it's going to get approved before any other vaccine. And yet none of them are proven to prevent anyone from getting the So-called virus hospitals are pushing every day even if you don't have it. Disgusting!!

5411	111703	@97McFly @CAPS_NAT1ON These vaccines aren't like that. They have mRNA that tells the body to make antibodies with the spikes that are just like the coronavirus. Only one company I believe is actually using dead virus in its vaccine and that one isn't on the market yet
5412	112262	This is a disgustingly negligent statement/thread from the WHO, it would go against existing knowledge of how coronaviruses work and would guarantee a vaccine wouldn’t be worth trying out lol.

5418	108879	So many people have taken the COViD-19 vaccine - over 150 million in the world, and nearly 1 million in Nigeria. Vaccine has not connected them to 5G, it has not put a chip in them. I have taken the vaccine, my parents ve too. We have not turned to zombie. @KNSMOH @KanoChronicle
5419	107971	@scotgovhealth The NHS online service for coronavirus vaccine certification does not work. Having to call. Currently 255th in queue. Get it sorted out. This all because there was no thought to put a QR code on a letter like everywhere else did. Shambles.
5420	111291	@tradetraderson @HannaMontona @Q10Of @WillyWonkaXRP I do.Besides, the flu (another coronavirus) has been around for over 100 years and we still don't have an effective vaccine against it-and it ain't mandatory either
5421	112608	Yeah they definitely gonna mandate this vaccine for COVID-19 we all say we not gonna take it but they gonna take all the privileges away No flying, Working, etc watch
5422	107690	Yeahhhh thanks but no thanks. I’m staying inside until I either get the vaccine or complete Breath of the Wild 2, whichever comes first.

5427	111830	@SkyNews @Keir_Starmer @BethRigby Why ? coronavirus isn’t influenza so the flu jab would have no effect
5428	202119	I'm happy that some of my friends are vaccinated but It's uncomfortable to see the disparity of vaccine between the West and the rest. I'm working with collaborators in Central, South East, South Asia. COVID-19 situations have not calmed down, with the second and third waves.
5429	112214	@nastystacface @zibilith @TRyanGregory Hi, Stacey. There isn’t a vaccine for Covid for dogs right now. There is a Coronavirus vaccine often included with the DHPP vaccine - often written as DHPPCvk. That is a vaccine against a coronavirus, but not Covid. It’s a virus that causes diarrhea.
5430	108424	@Steveofhope Exactly! And not everyone has the flu vaccine as low risk groups don’t need it, which will more than likely be the same situation when the Coronavirus one is available. We have herd immunity against flu as well.
5431	109224	You see how they're not making the vaccine accessible? They're only open during bank hours and they are acting like the pandemic is over. It's literally not people's fault they aren't vaccinated.
5432	109878	@ianhanomansing I got a call this morning from my doctor's office &amp; they are Only offering the Pfizer Vaccine... So yes I am going to take it bust mostly coz it's got the highest success rates out of all Covid19 Vaccinations
5433	108429	The user says when a #coronavirus vaccine comes to the market #Iran officials will be the first to secure it for themselves, then they will shout that our nation is not ready to lose its honor just for a vaccine.
5434	108941	This is such a joke!   No one cares, Don!Trump voters are not concerned about coronavirus, so they won’t get the vaccine.   Biden voters don’t trust Trump and his non-science based vaccine, so they won’t get the vaccine.

5437	109674	@adam_casto Yeah, supposedly if I shelter in place and wear a mask when I go outside it's going to destroy my immune system or something. That's what the lady that talks about the 5G microchips in the coronavirus vaccines anyway.

5439	112548	@BorisJohnson @MattHancock @CharlesWalkerMP @DesmondSwayne so tell us Boris and Matt if this virus is so deadly and you’re now considering tougher restrictions, why are dragging people into these vaccine centres where they’ll be mixing with strangers
5440	108299	@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Just because there is no vaccine right now for the Coronavirus. It doesn't mean it's our President's fault. I can think of No Greater President to take care of this than him. I sure wouldn't want the tree hugger Bernie Sanders to take care of this!!!!!

5443	111248	I am having a hard time understanding that having students back to in-person learning 2 days a week with the unsettledness of not enough substitutes when an outbreak happens is better for the students and parents then waiting until we have rapid testing for everyone, vaccine ect.

5446	110234	If you’re in an area that has Kaiser Health, they are giving the Covid-19 vaccine to non members.  It’s not commonly known, so you might want to give them a call, 65 and older in California.
5447	108028	Yay! So happy for your staff who got their COVID-19 vaccines today.You’ve all been so amazing to work with throughout this pandemic. You’ve been there for us often with efficiency in swabbing those on isolation with no transportation, &amp; enmasse in care homes. #Grateful💜
5448	111617	So @micro_outdoor has been running anti-vax ads on billboards here in Morgantown for months. They are still going strong, just waiting for their chance to further endanger my community by keeping  folks from getting a covid19 vaccine once it's available.
5449	109079	Good news comes from the US in the first phase trial of an ongoing vaccine to stop the coronavirus-spread pandemic Kovid-19. The first corona vaccine trials conducted here on humans have yielded very positive results.
5450	111403	@SandraWeeden No they know the #vaccine does sod all good - how can it when they haven’t isolated #coronavirus it’d be like waking up hungover with memory loss and randomly trying drinks as a hair of the dog
5451	111884	Please don't take this vaccine ! These globalists do not care about anyone! They drove you from your land in 1800's please don't take vaccine
5452	110627	@ImMissAdorable The only important vaccine for Covid-19 is the one you can get in to you asap. Pondering a preference for one over others isn't very bright... if it's approved and available, take it.
5453	107817	it's a failure then isn't it if you can still get it and spread it that in my book is a failing vaccine
5454	110059	@ohmoses I believe in vaccinations but wouldn't get a CoronaVirus vaccine. They take years to make, not months. I'd rather stay home.
5455	110171	@DoeFkin @realAdrianLight We've been dealing with coronavirus and mRNA stuff for awhile and it's not new. The specific vaccine is but unless there's actually Kree blood in it, were not dealing with a fresh and new technology

5459	112132	@CNNPolitics COVID is not a regional problem. Herd immunity is only effective when it is worldwide. If Americans risk their and the life of others for their republican brain disease, we need to give the vaccines to The Who to get forward. In the end we will reach herd immunity. Stop COVID-19
5460	109473	There are very few reasons for pursuing non vaccine herd immunity.1. You have no money2. You don’t care if people dieNon vaccine herd immunity is not in the interest of people.So, who does it benefit?

5467	108125	There is a reason why M4A is important. It’s insane that we the people are paying a company to develop a vaccine only for them to then resell it to us after we paid for it.

5470	110768	I'm waiting for the data first because the last efficacy data showed about 65%, so this would have to be a big jump, but assuming this is true the pandemic will be on its way out-Oxford vaccine much cheaper and easier to distribute than competitors
5471	112634	@Nancy_H1122 @RealCandaceO Just because you get the vaccine doesn't ensure you wont die from it. You can still get COVID19 &amp; you can still die EVEN if you have the vaccine. You can still get the flu even if you get the flu shot!!You're an idiot if you actually believe you wont die because u got the jab!
5472	109970	I’ve run pivotal studies, there’s nothing routine about pausing one. Unclear how they’ll determine this isn’t vaccine related. Underscores why we can’t rush a vaccine &amp; need long term data before rolling out... Hoping for the best. Also hoping this serves as a cautionary tale
5473	111694	No one should oblige you legally to take the covid-19 vaccine, this is a violation against one’s free will &amp; personal freedom. It is criminal that getting vaccinated is mandatory instead of optional. It is our physical bodies and we are free with it. #BeOnlyConcernedAboutYourSelf
5474	112091	@nycke1975 @littlecreep75 @FoxNews My distrust of the vaccine doesn't care who is president. It's based on my own knowledge of how poorly the trials are run. I will take my chance with the 99.5% survival if I happen to get Covid-19

5476	109982	How fucking stupid do they think we are? Literally anyone and everyone can travel safely. Covid-19 has a 99.7% survival rate. And the vaccine is not even 90% effective and has a lot of side effects. I’ll take my chances with the disease. Not putting that poison in my body.
5477	107879	My middle school had a regulation where we HAD to get the whooping cough vaccine.My highschool, a military base one btw, had a regulation where we HAD to get a flu shot.We COULD NOT go to school otherwise.Get the damn vaccine. Schools can absolutely regulate it.
5478	110921	@Global_Netizen1 @JimiGonda I don't know how vaccines work. Coronavirus has been around though. As far as I know.  I'm no expert in any of this. I should probably stay out of it. Lol

5480	110869	Just out of curiosity…how are these folks deciding that if spread continues like crazy that this virus will, in fact, be more apt to mutate in the direction of vaccine evasion? Is it just as likely it could evolve in a diff direction? @sailorrooscout @MonicaGandhi9

5483	109961	I'm no conspiracy theorist but can someone explain to me how the flu vaccine, after all these years, is only 30/40% effective but the vaccines, to the never before seen deadliest virus ever, can be 90/95% effective announced the week after the election?   #CovidVaccine #covid19

5490	109804	This thread.You don’t have to agree with the views of these doctors but the scale of censorship should make you question just what the hell is behind all this.Why are we only being directed towards rushed vaccine treatment for a virus with such a low fatality rate?Wake up.

5496	107885	@dockaurG It’s the elephant in the room. They don’t want people understand that the vaccines currently in production may not do everything we’ve been promised. They may not be doing this out of malice - maybe to give people hope, but to ignore other solutions is just dangerous. #COVID19
5497	108272	If viruses were sentient, they’d all be mightily pissed at coronavirus for crapping in their nest. They’d be cheering for a COVID vaccine so they’d get some action again.
5498	112562	This vaccine appeared before everyone else, but it is still in short supply. Russia pays compensation to countries that did not wait for Sputnik V. Any other foreign vaccines are prohibited. What is this if not genocide?

Not doingso is a bad sign.

5507	110366	It’s a virus it’s never going away we need to learn to live with it just like flu,colds,streptococcus until a vaccine is found. Unfortunately a lot of people are going to die in the process.
5508	112273	@bfriendmyles The mistake you are making, because you’re misinformed is you’re assuming a ‘reaction’ is bad. If you knew how vaccines worked you’d realise that a ‘reaction’ is your body building antibodies to the COVID-19 virus. day after vaccine I had fever, muscle aches, fatigue GOOD STUFF!
5509	109856	@SRABrotherhood @BretWeinstein I mean, speaking for myself - I just didn't want to get COVID-19 with a naive immune system. I'm not panicking, just acting prudently. Now that everyone who wants a vaccine in the US can get one, I'm fine with letting it rip.

5512	109825	@GoldSuzie considering coronavirus is related to the common cold. Cold virus mutates every two months, I don’t think in the Long run even the vaccines gonna work. It would’ve been better for humanity if the virus is related to the flu, at least then it only mutates once every 12 month

So what reasonable propositions do you have to limit the death rate of coronavirus that doesn’t involve masks in public places?
5521	110029	@MAGA2020MAG @GavinNewsom FACT - Covid-19 is in the human pop. 4 good, fast or slowFACT - mask wearing only slows it down; it can't stop itFACT - herd immunity doesn't mean that no one will ever catch it again, it just reduces the likelihoodFACT - there has NEVER been a vaccine for a coronavirus. EVER.
5522	108765	#CNNTownHall could this particular strain of Covid-19 change? If so, how would this be trackable in coming up with a vaccine?
5523	111404	On 6th October 2020 (almost eight months ago), I've pre-ordered a PS5.Today, I've received my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Still waiting for the PlayStation.Now, this is absolutely the *correct* ordering of the priorities, but I didn't expect it to go this way.
5524	109536	@danwootton @RossjournoClark Why does no one listen to the experts? Its a coronavirus. This is a variation of the common cold not a flu. A vaccine will only help 50%. Any immunity fades after a short time. There can be no herd immunity without a vaccine.
5525	110810	@KingGeorgeNY @John_Gkinis25 @MAGAPATRIOT34 @EtherealRose456 @NYGovCuomo FFS!! A vaccine gives you the same antibodies without you actually getting the virus and either dying or having severe damage to body. Aldo it will take years before covid19 infects enough ppl to have herd immunity. Why are so many Americans so dumb??
5526	109704	@thehill Then make sure they don’t get the vaccine until everyone else does first. And insurance companies shouldn’t cover any of their COVID-19 expenses for this reckless behavior.
5527	108471	@Reuters Why? Every vaccinated person can contract and spread the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The vaccine is said to only protect the vaccinated person against severe symptoms of Covid-19 disease — not against catching the virus. Any vaccine requirement for travel is insane.
5528	111970	@Q__on2_it_yet__ The Flu Vaccine contains Coronavirus. This Plandemic has been planned many years in advance. Don’t ever take a vaccine again. Don’t ever allow children to have a vaccine ever.

5530	108139	This is why the @Pfizer potion is NOT a vaccine.  NO ANTIGEN is contained therein.  Same for #Moderna.The potion uses manmade mRNA to reprogram human cells to make the protein which then triggers the immune system to produce antibodies.What could possibly go wrong?
5531	108246	@OfficialDGISPR Sir why PAKISTAN not participate in clinical trial of coronavirus vaccine with China.
5532	109906	@PeterHotez Hello I have an important question for you - I received the J&amp;J COVID-19 vaccine a month ago out of town and now locally I am being offered the Pfizer vaccine. Is there any harm in getting a second dose this way?
5533	111189	Sounds like they understand the vaccine really doesn’t protect us from shit, it’s never gonna end, &amp; mutations will keep happening. Now they’re talking about 3 rounds of booster shots. Why? because they know it’s not going away. Vaccine or not. Boosters or not.
5534	111543	If mass vaccinations will not stop the virus, then what's the point of them? Why wouldn't I just keep wearing my mask then? #vaccine #vaccination #COVID19 #CovidVaccine

5540	110354	You think the travel industry, like airlines, for example, would require vaccinations because more people would feel comfortable flying and that's good for the bottom line. Like I don't understand why they don't require vaccines or a negative COVID-19 test.
5541	108840	i think if anyone is immune to the coronavirus it would be steve-o, scientists should use his blood for a vaccine immediately
5542	109113	We don’t need a vaccine, we need to strength our immune systems (eat organic NO GMO), make sure you have enough vitamins D &amp; C (second stage of covid is actually acute scurvy). Practice good personal hygiene. I wouldn’t trust any vaccine now esp knowing what Billy Gates

5544	112286	If you don't believe the medical profession about getting a COVID-19 vaccine, then please be consistent and stay home when you get sick.  The hospital would just treat you with the medical science you're ignoring.
5545	108186	Sooooooooooooo, you think a president has a power to command us to take a vaccine that might be dangerous?Would you be so gung ho if this was Trump commanding YOU to take that vaccine?Inquiring minds want to know.
5546	111916	This is the game changer - it is vastly cheaper then the 2 dose vaccines, easily distributed and administered. It may be lagged behind in terms of supply to Canada but has incredible possibilities for managing infection in the general population. #greatnewsonafriday
5547	111086	@yesnicksearcy @OutNow45 NOVEL coronavirus. The fact that our vaccines show any efficacy against strains that didn't exist until after they were created, trialed, and submitted for EUA is impressive. Their mRNA platform will also minimize turnaround for new versions if needed.Great indeed.
5548	107924	The coronavirus vaccines will probably prevent you from getting sick with Covid-19. But it’s not yet clear whether you can still get infected asymptomatically and silently spread the virus.-NYT
5549	108217	I know it’s easy to panic when these headlines come across our timelines, but an entire arsenal of vaccine candidates is slowly building up.Shots on goal approach has never been more valuable than it is right now. Hopefully this is just a bump in the road for one candidate.
5550	112737	And that's why my kids will not go to school until there is a vaccine, or a robust testing and contact tracing plan is fully enacted.  #KeepSchoolsClosed
5551	108684	Just signed up for my #COVID19 vaccine — it was possibly the easiest thing I’ve ever done.  My appointment is in 2 days. It’s a shame @NHDems spent so much time and effort trying to undermine public confidence in the process.Don’t be dissuaded — get the vaccine! #nhpolitics
5552	110187	And this is the vaccine garbage they are going to force our health  care workers to have,Not in my name,Not in the name of our Conservative party,Health secretary,and not in the name of British Law
5553	202340	Pfizer/BionTech COVID-19 vaccine trial results: 20k got the vaccine. Only 8 of those got COVID. 20k got a placebo.162 got Covid, but only 3 got ‘severe’ Covid and only 1 was hospitalized.
5554	110336	COVID-19 vaccine. Why isn’t it frozen when they open the freezer? How do you inject something that cold ?
5555	112333	Can’t we please wait until every child get their Covid-19 vaccine done before we allow them to attend normal schooling? @DrAdhamBaba @DGHisham PdPR exist because of that, aren’t they?
5556	111257	"""@realDonaldTrump Tantruming Trump, """"Damn that Coronavirus. Ruined my stock market. Now my polls are down. I gotta get a vaccine. Wait, I dont even give my kids vaccines. Dont matter. I'm going to make the best vaccines. What do you mean it takes over a year to make a vaccine? Its Hillarys fault!"""""""
5557	109560	@realDonaldTrump Why do they need a covid-19 Bill if the vaccine is basically ready. you said during the last debate it was going to be about two weeks after the election and we would have a vaccine, so where is that?
5558	108632	@BleacherNation I’ve heard of this outside of covid19 too. I’d be ok with that. No way am I attending games until there’s a vaccine
5559	109563	No! No so called COVID-19 vaccine for me. I value my health and my liberty and freedom. That vaccine is poison and will be used to know where anyone is during their last days.
5560	110276	@MihrThakar Can you choose which arm you get the COVID-19 vaccine in?The answer is a simple yes. Just like any other vaccine, you can also choose which arm you get the COVID-19 vaccine in.
5561	111440	Not what you originally told us, Matt. Nothing like it whatsever. And we may never get a viable vaccine, so will you hold us back forever? Who gave you that right? Absolutely no one. I see there is a clear reason why you eschew parliamentary scrutiny, so desperately needed now.
5562	110075	Great to see @KizzyPhD  and @BarneyGrahamMD continued to recognized for their work on coronavirus vaccine.Well deserved.
5563	111461	@AstorAaron Agree with David, disagree with Aaron. Vaccine mandates are vital. Masking is important until enough of the population is vaccinated. We're not there yet. Covid-19 is a bad actor. It can enter the brain/other organs and cause long term problems--problems that will tax our system.
5564	111571	@RpublicRestored Bill Gates wants something in the COVID-19 vaccine that will tell if we’ve gotten the vaccine. I’m saying I don’t trust that and I’d bet it will track us as well.
5565	107743	It will be free because the population will be the test subjects to observe the long term effects the vaccine has, unless they've been testing this since 2015 there is not a chance I'd be getting this vaccine basically a guinea pig for some multi billion dollar corporation.
5566	110334	Genuinely can't wrap my mind around how bafflingly, absurdly, unquestionably stupid you have to be after the last year to not get the vaccine.
5567	107926	We all need to work together to protect the world from #COVID19 and the May 4 pledging conference must be a success. Will @g20org states please step up and release much needed funds for response efforts to @WHO @CEPIvaccines and @gavi? Together, we can beat this pandemic.
5568	111284	"India's stand is right.This ""vaccine passport"" cannot be internationally imposed by Northern countries until everyone in the world is vaccinated.""No one is safe until everyone is safe."" Since this is agreed upon as a moral stand, let all governments follow it.@WHO @drharshvardhan"
5569	108951	@InterBang @PeterHotez @maggiemfox @CNN Is not my intention to spoil something. I want to know what are we talking about. So we count to the huge number of Covid19 in USA also the asymptomatic, but say vaccine is effective in 90%, when this number is valid only for symptomatic and this with specific criteria?
5570	108324	I did read that the mu variant may not be as infectious as the Alpha or Delta variant, but it is concerning if the mu variant is resistant to vaccines since it could thwart the progress made there.
5571	110444	I'm getting my first dose of covid19 vaccine , girl I am so contre coueur but I am doing it for a reason..a goal..
5572	109487	the only cure for coronavirus is bed rest. just like any other VIRUS it is not bacterial aka no antibiotics and any vaccine will be like a flu shot but it is still a VIRUS.
5573	112288	We're interested to hear LGBTQ peoples views on the COVID-19 vaccine 💉Will you be getting the vaccine once you are offered it?
5574	108900	@CarpathianMts @what_about_john @BritMartinez @realDonaldTrump They have treated COVID19 patients with HCQ.  I am not going to debate this with you.  Feel free to line up to get the vaccine vs using a drug that has been around for 60+ years with no problems.
5575	109108	@John701aaa @ABC7 I was actually going to get vaccinated after my Mom and Dad, but my dad died after the 2nd shot of Moderna.  My mom still lives.  Now my mother in law, wife and daughter refuse their vaccine.  Nobody in my Family has ever gotten sick from Coronavirus.  Not even my dad.  R.I.P.
5576	202045	Vaxxed to the max.  My 2nd dose of Pfizer took place 2 hrs ago. So far I just have a sore arm. Go get vaccinated!#letsgetvaccinated #HousePfizer #VaccinesSaveLives #COVID19 #endthepandemic #doyourpart #letsendthis https://t.co/9Qo9FZZCTf
5577	110726	Very well done again to all at Oxford University who have created a working vaccine. Fingers crossed vunerable persons/NHS staff will get vaccinations soon. We need to keep working together to recover from what is happening now ❤👏👇
5578	109543	@standardnews @sianberry Coronavirus will be a drag on the economy till there is a vaccine. No reason for stocks to be up
5579	108704	They are endangering the entire town, the cops and their families with no masks on and also the protestors have no point at all.  They are holding anti-vaxx signs too.If a coronavirus vaccine comes out they won't get one.You can't cure stupid, but you can vote it out.
5580	112258	If you’re not a conspiracy theorist i feel sorry for you ngl, i don’t have all the facts on why you shouldn’t trust this vaccine, in fact i don’t have any, but you know what....MI NAH TEK IT
5581	112779	FYI - though I think y'all are smart enough to know this. The coronavirus vaccine for animals does NOT protect against covid.  Do NOT tell people to go their their pet vaccinated against covid via the coronavirus vaccine.  I'll [redacted] you.
5582	110884	@Cernovich So what are y’all going to do if there’s a vaccine for #coronavirus ? Serious question. Will you take it? Will you tell your elderly relatives to take it? Or not?
5583	109731	@OfSifter @JohnColton70 Except there’s a vaccine for the flu. So how are we supposed to treat it like the flu? Can’t get a shot for Covid19.
5584	112820	@jmtiger9899 I took my son to the doctor a few weeks back for a checkup. The doctor told me that Coronavirus has been around for years and there has never been a vaccine. He said people would be crazy to think this one will suddenly have one and it work. Pretty scary
5585	110832	1/4: @nycgov is in effect mandating the vaccine. “If you don’t get the vaccine, you can’t enjoy simple everyday activities.”
5586	111606	A bit concerning but I guess he has done enough to be trusted. I don't ever see there being a vaccine and Trump knows it!
5587	112788	People assume or take it for granted that a #covid19 #coronavirus #vaccine will be found. What if a vaccine is never found? We don’t have a vaccine for the common cold or for HIV nor an effective flu vaccine. @newscomauHQ @WHO #wuflu
5588	108661	@marketman52 They say the anti-body may last less than 3 months if you’ve had Coronavirus, so how can they ensure a vaccine will any longer than that?
5589	112693	We want to hear from people who are still deciding whether to get a vaccine, and give them the opportunity to talk with an expert about it. If that's you, or someone you know, please reach out! @kschorsch @beckyvevea @IMPACT4HC
5590	202103	Didn’t i know the reaction pain after the vaccine, similar to Covid-19 vaccine. Hand so sore and damn heavy 😭
5591	112575	American citizen tries to fly to hawaii with fake vaccine card and got arrested. A citizen of south America breaks the law illegally crossing the U.S.  border and they get a free flight to another location in the U.S. without any vaccine requirement. hmmm
5592	111512	@ronnytodgers @andrew_croxford Yes, and that may be the problem. When they tested previous coronavirus vaccines on ferrets - which had excellent antibody response from the vaccine - they died when exposed to the wild virus. That is why there has been no successful coronavirus vaccine to date.
5593	202362	I just got my first #CovidVaccine today. One step closer to things being back to normal and sending #COVID19 straight to hell https://t.co/la94khIWGk
5594	108200	Im not american but All im going to say is that theres no way that a working vaccine will be avliaboe until the middle of next year
5595	112579	Quick question,Would a complete disregard for Social Distancing,Affect the timeline for a vaccine??@VermaN21
5596	112873	@bigron2000 If I do get Covid-19 I will get better the natural way without going out to get a vaccine that doesn’t work and has fatal side effects. I’d actually rather die from Bill Gates and Fauci’s superbug than get vaccinated with god knows what.
5597	109215	@basboon007 @thehill You understand that MRNA has been around for a while, just hadn’t been used as a coronavirus vaccine since before this pandemic there was never a coronavirus vaccine. Any vaccine regardless of the platform would by definition be experimental? Do you just ignore all data?
5598	111501	You mean like #vaccines and how #Americans are so spoiled that they’re literally turning away not one but 3 FREE medical tool options that will save millions on this planet? When there are countries that would just be grateful for ONE? #PerspectivesAreKey
5599	111835	@ForAllTheMarble @LegalizeitLala Pork is a harborer of many virus'. It is a dirty meat and different coronavirus' are often present. It's so toxic it is illegal to transport pig manure across State lines. Flu vaccine is another big link. Gelatin in any vax is from pork too. Plus the mass pig killings in China
5600	112803	Even Regular flu vaccines don’t protect against all strains and variations of flu circulating each year. They try to target the most like one to spread widely or do the most damage. Close is not enough in viruses.
5601	110155	I hate this take so much, its like telling people to stop looking for a coronavirus vaccine because cancer still exist 🤦🏾‍♂️
5602	201909	So grateful my soon to be 95yr old grandmother finally got her #COVID19 vaccine. Just wondering why it took this long though? An obvious failure of the current provincial government. @maritstiles @AndreaHorwath @StevenDelDuca https://t.co/vNXvW8p2TY
5603	110458	The Republicans are gearing up to once again vote against covid relief and funding for vaccines and testing so we can get back to business. If every Democrat votes for the bill, it will pass without them, but it shouldn't be so close. #StimulusChecksNOW #COVID19 #vaccine
5604	107775	@nytimes Let's call it what it is: institutionalized racism. Just like Coronavirus, there's no vaccine. Just like Coronavirus, it kills by suffocation while the victim dies crying out: I can't breathe, I can't breathe but differently from Coronavirus staying home doesn't help.
5605	111078	My kids have an appointment for 11/20, but a week earlier and a pic with the trophy sounds pretty good. Can all adults get boosters now too? If so, I'll roll up my sleeve again.
5606	111326	@NicolaSturgeon @jasonleitch @JeaneF1MSP @FionaCMcQueen With student nurses still being put on the frontline when will we become a priority for #Coronavirus #vaccine? Universities say we are not priority for facefitting nor vaccine but we are still to be accomodated.
5607	110051	Adam got his first round of the Coronavirus vaccine. He goes back in April for the other shot. This means there's a 90% chance the kids will be going back to school this coming school year. It's going to be so weird! (And I'll miss not being sick from the stuff they bring home!)
5608	111734	So they believe in the science of an antibody test but they don't believe in the science of a vaccine? Seems stupid enough.
5609	111827	@EricROlson @sciencentric How long would a vaccine be effective? Since we have seen how wildly differently the COVID-19 virus has impacted people around the world, is there a one vaccine fits all remedy?
5610	110259	What is this bullshit?  They don't know how long you are protected from the vaccine either.  The key would be how long it takes the virus to mutate, and when it does if it is even still contagious to humans.  We don't know that yet.
5611	111340	I’ve an unutilized Dubai return ticket. Maybe I go just use ‘am go collect COVID-19 vaccine sef. Abi, no be so?
5612	111643	Thanks Terry Bradshaw. I don’t care if Rodgers didn’t take the vaccine, but just be honest about it and follow the rules/protocols.
5613	107908	I'm surely not #antivax . I don't believe the #COVID19 vaccines are safe for me; they're not effective for some people (as we're now seeing); and after being lied to for the last 21 months about how deadly the disease is, to how effective and lasting natural immunity is etc.
5614	109603	@Independent Only the creation of effective and safe vaccines will be able to control the coronavirus. Until this happens the world will not return to the old normal
5615	108545	Covid-19 vaccines arrived yesterday in Italy, but i don't trust it, it seems so un-tested!What do you guys think of it?Btw i'm not gonna take it for now, i prefere to let others try it first
5616	202339	Hey all. I got the vaccine yesterday. Today I feel like I got run over by a light-duty truck. It was the first dose, but because I had a rough case of COVID-19 back in January, I expected to not feel great. One of my Covid symptoms was a feeling like shingles over my sides.
5617	111667	@GovInslee How long will your segregational and discriminatory policies be in effect?If everyone has access to the vaccine, and you believe vaccines work, then WHY is this necessary?#RevokeInsleesEmergencyPowershttps://t.co/KfSkfMOC59
5618	202364	Christmas came early this year! I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to receive the COVID-19 vaccine today. Feeling so thankful! 😊🙌🏼
5619	110279	@patrick2278t @KTLA NONSENSE quit listening to AM radio nuts! Immunity from COVID-19 in NOT long lasting enough for a non-vaccine herd immunity to work. Notice how New Zealand did a great jut with a non-pharmaceutical containment?
5620	112444	After further research and analysis, I have determined that CSL most likely added a component from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) because they were attempting to develop a coronavirus vaccine would be a safe and effective for treating patients with an immunodeficiency.
5621	112457	@realDonaldTrump Ready to be honest about this?  The task force has falsely led people to believe a vaccine makes it all magically better.  If they knew distancing and masks would still be in play would they still be advocating lockdowns and now school?
5622	107802	So @CompComSA most def needs an urgent COVID-19 Vaccine (internal) premptive pricing task team.Help out at @HealthZA and @SAHPRA1Laws needed to PRICE ASSESS BEFORE WE SPEND THE MONEY. Justify the price, or price variations. Prove it is low or no profit. And, not time bound.
5623	202423	#IGotTheShot! After 21 days, I got my second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. ✨💉So thankful for this opportunity and hoping that many more in my community continue getting vaccinated to reduce their risk of COVID-19 disease! https://t.co/puhOpHhAQn

5625	111187	@aslavitt46 Not me.When will vaccines be available for EVERYBODY in Virginia, @GovernorVA ?It looks it will be MONTHS (July or August) before I can get ACCESS to a #COVID19 vaccine.Yes, I have PRE-REGISTERED.Oh, My Lord. 😩#COVID19Vaccine @VDHgov @VDHCommissioner @WHCOVIDResponse
5626	202183	A little sore in my arm from my covid-19 vacc yesterday in Santiago Chile. In the same way the Lord sent his Angel to shut the Lions mouths for Daniel, the Lord sent a wonderful Chilean nurse to our family to help us both to get the vaccine. So grateful. Please pray for Yanira
5627	111793	@AlanPattersonMD @davidmackau There has never been an effective vaccine for any coronavirus and there never will be because they mutate.  Our immune systems are quite capable of dealing with it, as long as we are healthy. You should be promoting weight loss, fitness and a healthy diet. Not this nonsense.
5628	112367	When is @MountSinaiNYC going to be giving vaccines to their patients? Patients that receive their care there should get their vaccine there too. Honestly what’s the hold up? #vaccine #ny #mountsinai #COVID19 #nyc #COVID19Vaccine @NYCMayorsOffice @NYCMayor @311
5629	201864	wtf covid-19 vaccine's a disaster... and I saw the image of my president getting a vaccine the other day. Dear God, let nothing happen.
5630	109020	Unless you are actually willing to enforce this, it is a pointless gesture and you should just hold out in your homes and pray for a vaccine. Stock up on food and toilet paper, it's about to get nasty.
5631	112261	Moderna coronavirus vaccines will arrive in Canada's territories on December 28th.That is, provided there aren't any snowstorms or other weather issues.So, just days after Christmas, needles will likely be going into arms in the North.
5632	108537	@Funnytrousers @EthicalRenewal @DanielFooksArt But you won't NOT catch anything like a coronavirus just cos you had it before in the same way a vaccine won't. This narrative &amp; whole muddled speak around the complete issue is the most blatantly confusing and divisive ploy I've ever seen. And there's plenty of them going around

5634	109372	@jerrymwd @barbaras1616 @GovMurphy lol coronavirus has been here since the 60s and no vaccines for any of them and people just think we're going to get one for this one?  Time to build up that immunity and get on with our lives.  Long overdo.
5635	111554	Since O****d rejected my graduate application I shall similarly reject any Covid-19 vaccine developed by them.

5641	109911	2) The answer is simply: they don’t want to know why, nor do they care (despite constantly saying how they wish they could understand). They‘d rather perpetuate the narrative that divides us and demonizes anyone who even questions the #vaccine &amp; #covid19 polices. Not constuctive
5642	112552	@EdHull8 I think they’ll come up for a vaccine for COVID-19 before they discover a vaccine for Trump. So...
5643	107853	The irony in all this is she was finally going to get the vaccine Monday but got sick the night before
5644	112601	When it comes to this vaccine.I will not take it! The only way you will get me to take it is to physically hold me down and jab it in me. If you do that I will defend myself.Digest and decide your next move.#COVID19
5645	202363	My friend had 2 shots got covid ended up in the hospital with pneumonia brain fog. She thought she was going to die. Get the booster.
5646	109946	Why this panic and coercion of the common people in such a high-handed manner to get covid-19 vaccines pumped into their bodies, when they have Good Innate Immunity and, thereby, they just don't need them, at all. Isn't this Vaccine terrorism?
5647	202201	I've signed up at a local pharmacy as well to receive my #AstraZenaca vaccine and I hope to get an appointment soon. Every person vaccinated gets us one step closer to bringing this pandemic to a close. If you're eligible, please sign up today for your first dose!
5648	202265	@HSELive how can I do to obtain proof that I received my 1st vaccine shot? I am abroad and need to provide evidence of my 1st shot (date, vaccine type, etc) to book my 2nd shot and have it done abroad. I don't have my Covid-19 vaccination record card with me.
5649	112316	@Frank__Davies Their is a #armsRace to get vaccines for #COVID19 much like the space race but with industrial spies
5650	112144	@LMakhetloane @MawandeMothibe Also, there will be seasonal changes to the virus, just like what happens with influenza viruses. That's why there's a yearly flu vaccine available and I suspect the same will happen with this coronavirus.
5651	109306	@PhilipRucker Trump doesn't get all this credit.  Coronaviruses have been around and Covid-19 is a variation. 17 yrs ago, they started working on a vaccine for SARS which is a coronavirus.  That's why it was done so quickly...it was halfway there when scientists tweaked for C-19.
5652	202032	Week finished. I have now gotten my 2nd dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine, and my certificate from my middle school has came in. Thank you @PoeMiddleSchool for the last 3 years. https://t.co/IPt5UrXquL
5653	108305	Excellent news , 10 days it starts.?  and if the Tory and SNP governments get there act together everyone could should have the vaccine within 4 weeks and back to normal, now that would be a happy New year , we have 3 vaccines JUST GIVE THE PEOPLE THE VACCINE .....!
5654	107894	@zerohedge Not surprising. There will be endless shots ahead. Covid-19 virus and vaccine turns on to be an effective way to significantly reduce world population. Enjoy
5655	107777	Am I missing something with this Pfizer SARS-2 coronavirus vaccine announcement, because I've yet to hear anyone say how long it's effective. 3 months? 6 months? A year? For life? Anyone? Seems like this is a critical detail.
5656	112648	@bruceymonkey @kimbikeskc @vicc_nicolee @warofthesuburbs We've never been able to develop a single anti-viral or vaccine for any coronavirus. Even after worldwide infections of SARS, MERS and 15% of the common cold every year.Yet we can make one for a novel coronavirus within months? Draw your own conclusions.
5657	108074	Accept this fact that historically it took avenge 11 years 2develop a vaccine. Secondly gene based technology is new with no proven history so it should take more time then normal technology. Otherwise vaccines will take more life’s then #coronavirus @Iamsamirarora @ETNOWlive
5658	201987	Evelyn does not visit me in Welland due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.  All my vaccine shots were given.  I also got my seasonal Flu shot.  I did get my booster shot.  I have selected to stay away from any bar.  sometimes I go to restaurants.  MacDonalds is a very short walk away.
5659	112407	@JenJoeGibson @Joannew68022274 @spunawebxx Covid has never been isolated.The virus is a normal coronavirus no more dangerous than the flu.Will you be queuing to get your kids jabbed with an unlicenced, untested and unneeded vaccine?
5660	109422	I just spoke to a close friend in the medical field who said there may be an issue with the Covid19 vaccine.  Denmark is rumored to have an issue with covid-19 mutating from Animal exposure and is making the vaccine ineffective.  This news has me anxiety ridden.
5661	107694	@PhilipWatson_ This is what we do about anti-vaxxers: No job. No entry. No NHS accessBeing coughed on by someone with coronavirus is not my idea of freedom. Those refusing a vaccine must face the consequences. The rest of us have rights too, including the right to life
5662	110000	Going to get my COVID-19 vaccine booster a little later today. Excited to try my best to keep myself and those around me healthy. Will share updates on its effects on me to show folks as to what its like. My 2nd shot wore me out for 24 hours, but was otherwise fine for reference.
5663	109801	My guess is you better have a damn good answer to question No. 5:“If you have ever received a FDA  approved vaccine ... please explain how your sincerely held religious belief ... causes you to object to the COVID-19 vaccine compared to other vaccines you received.”
5664	108364	@bernhardsulzer @CalebJHull Riddle me this? Why is it that VAERS is actually saying that the vaccine for Covid19, or The Coof, The China Virus, The Pandemic, etc whatever you call it. The Gov Funded VAERS is saying the Vaccine is actually killing more people than any other Vaccine made in the past 15 years.
5665	110823	Will you get the covid-19 vaccine once its available for you to get? #CovidVaccine #COVID19 #vaccine Please retweet!!
5666	110197	Really disturbing numbers from recent @CCDHate survey: 16% of Britons say they would refuse a #coronavirus vaccine, and another 15% unsure if they would take it. Anti-vaxx propapanga has apparently entered deeply into British culture, leveraging the long reach of social media.

5669	111335	It had nothing to do with the vaccine. It is thugs who know they can do the crime with no punishment. God help us?
5670	112033	@RepSires @CoryBooker @SenatorMenendez I’m in Hudson county NJ &amp; getting the vaccine is like mining for gold. Is my neighborhood being ignored because it’s a predominantly immigrant &amp; non-white community? #COVID19 #vaccine

5674	110323	@ReddCoach @itschappy @btbarnes11 The vaccine is a treatment. Just like the flu vaccine.There is no immunity, natural or otherwise to a coronavirus.
5675	112145	Someone should explain to @chrisreykdal how vaccines work.You see, w/the EUA COVID-19 Vaccines, they just tell your body to spike protein antibodies.This is like throwing caps in those ring toss games.  Sometimes one will make it on the bottle.But, you still get sick
5676	201940	Hey #Detroit! If you’re 16+, you can get the vaccine (I get my second shot tomorrow).  Let’s all roll out sleeves up and knock #COVID19 out!
5677	108265	"Why is it these folks never come to the conclusion that ""God"" has their backs by giving humans the knowledge to devise a vaccine to keep them safe?Because they then wouldn't have an excuse to claim ""persecution,"" which is the far-right's political bread &amp; butter. Buncha whiners"
5678	108705	@RepAdamSchiff What world do you live in Trump keeps pushing that we need to get a vaccine witch is science. But it is funny that a party that always is saying we need to believe the science, thinks there is more than 2 genders. (Male and Female) plus I think this whole covid19 is a hoxes
5679	111052	@Jay_Beezy27 @fife_rodney @FOX5Vegas @GovSisolak Still this is not “just a cold”, it’s the coronavirus, a new strain of it, that has no vaccine. People are being bed ridden for weeks to months. Over 100,000 dead just in the United States. That’s not something you can argue is false, if you do well you’re living a fantasy.
5680	111534	When will the black community wake up and really see what's going on? These people think they are indespensible...you get to be the guinea pigs for the new vaccine...#ALLLIVESMATER
5681	110805	@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Trump is only doing this so there won’t b an election so he can stay president.... Coronavirus is a trick for all Americans. STOP taking the vaccine!!!!!!!!
5682	111344	Guys. This isn’t interesting or smart or good. It’s shitty. They could require the vaccine for employees. Instead they’re trying to save money on paid leave.
5683	108694	Well we are not yet fully using China made vaccine. We must be worried if we are exclusively using China-made vaccine. The bigger problem is how to make the vaccination faster and efficiently. We are still on the low rate.

5688	109379	No!!! They will charge thousands for one vaccine as they have been doing for children's vaccines...For this, I can NEVER trust private hospitals and doctors...Main aim is to mint money, even during pandemic

5697	109152	Seeing lots of pics like this one on my timeline yesterday/today. Doctors and health-care workers in Canada getting their #COVID19 vaccine. A shot of hope indeed. Thank you!
5698	202187	For my mental health, I'm blocking everyone on my newsfeed that expresses ignorant-ass-commentary about SARS-COV-2 and misinformation about the #COVID19 vaccine.
5699	111636	hey can we start a rumor that the coronavirus vaccine can be transmitted in cum so that snopes has to write an article like“FALSE. Drinking semen from a vaccinated top will not protect you against the coronavirus. Here’s an interview with Fauci where i asked him this question”
5700	108639	With regards to this whole vaccine row, aren’t we supposed to be battling the coronavirus not each other?No wonder the human race is fucked.
5701	108619	Except here's the thing. This is a man made virus.  And not only were they funded to CREATE this virus, they also were funded to come up with a vaccine. And when the world is sick enough, this one company will ALSO GET FUNDED TO PROVIDE THE WORLD WITH THE VACCINE
5702	107773	@dan_pettit23 @yelobeli @Vinylmusiclives @GMB @lisanandy There’s this little thing called coronavirus and the millions of vaccines for it being rolled out right now. Any idiot can realise the Governent would get a bump from thatLabour meanwhile is still recovering from Long Corbyn which will take a while.

5705	111669	So if #COVID19 ever ends...fingers crossed 🤞 #CovidVaccine  I think I’m going to sew all my glitzy masks together into a patchwork quilt.
5706	107991	@ClayTravis Thanks so much for questioning the Coronavirus vaccine. You're killing your own listeners. Great Job and keep it up.
5707	110232	@RecParkSF @LondonBreed Why is Covid-19 vaccine out and yet business still closed? why are things not back to normal why is it taking months on purpose who is be hide the bull shit who is getting rich?          Peace on earth
5708	107696	@hildabast @sean_halleran “My” vaccine requires room temperature so I wouldn’t have to argue cold chain and given “my” vaccine has data with other coronavirus vaccines such as MERS and cancer research with minimal AE’s it’s not hard to foresee the issues with rna once they become deployed en masse.
5709	110822	How did this idiot survived corona virus without the Vaccine 🤣. What do they use to cure your own corona 🦠?  If you do not remove this video before tonight . You will end up having the real corona virus 🦠.
5710	201887	@R_H_Ebright @PhilHollowayEsq @COVID19 And do not call me an anti vaxxer.  Myself, my husband and my 16 yo are all fully vaxxed. My 14yo has had one shot. I’m holding off on the second. But my 12 yo son will not be getting it until there is more safety data surrounding the myocarditis issue.  I’m not ignorant.
5711	112629	Yeah, it's official.I think any person who can get the vaccine and refuses to do so, then subsequently gets #COVID19, should be refused medical care if treating them will take space from a vaccinated person.
5712	111286	@swansoupy @MetabolicallyF @walkher2thegate @CiaShade @Theejoshhalll @_geela_ Right? Like nobody goes around asking if they had any of their other vaccines or their flu shot (anymore anyways) and flip out like these people do with the COVID-19 vaccine 🤦‍♂️ I'm all about personal freedom of choice, get it, don't get it, I'm good with either choice for people!
5713	112701	@ghuff No, I honestly don’t considering it hadn’t been mentioned/referenced for many prior tweets. You’re just bringing it back up to try and taint my argument. Yes, I do. The spike protein located on COVID-19 and in the vaccines is damaging to our cardio-vascular system.
5714	112264	@RonaldNHughes In order to avoid being infected by the COVID-19 virus again, then spread the virus to others, the day before yesterday, I mustered up the courage to get my first COVID-19 mRNA vaccine Pfizer. I need to take my second COVID-19 mRNA vaccine Pfizer after 21 days.
5715	109627	@PostOpinions @FelipeDLH @PostEverything How do you think the globalists got a huge supply of miracle vaccines in short order. They money laundered through Afghanistan. Then they created a coronavirus pandemic. Our benefactors are psychopaths.
5716	112392	@Charvettebey Coronavirus has been around since ppl began getting colds....which, who knows how long that’s been. There have been other forms, like SARS or MERS. Seems like they def had some data to go by. Covid, though, this one spreads so fast and furious. Really hope the vaccine helps.
5717	112687	The govm't doesn't care about person's rights and immunity.Their agenda is get the jab or get out.  #communist
5718	109356	@larrysivaans I guess all coronavirus can spread through air if we catch droplets (even the tiny ones) from patients' cough or sneeze and this virus is kind of new also there's no vaccines yet so this virus spread rapidly than the other coronavirus
5719	111128	How do people take the COVID-19 vaccine if it isn't available in Civil Hospitals and PHCs? 🤔Health Minister @drharshvardhan will keep denying that there is vaccine shortage, but the reality is way different than what he claims! Here the Civil Hospital has run out of vaccine 😡
5720	108308	I get being apprehensive over getting the COVID vaccine. But to say it took less than a year to develop is misleading. Yes it did take less than a year, but why? It’s because they were not starting from ground zero. SARS and MERS are also a type of coronavirus
5721	202370	"11/ How I feel after shot #1 of the #COVID19Vaccine is how my parents and parents-in-law felt after #2.My experience is admittedly ""anecdata,"" but maybe it's true that folks who already had #COVID19 respond to shot #1 like everyone else responds to shot #2."

5725	108378	@hannahturl @JeremyVineOn5 They’ve not found a vaccine for HIV so don’t hold your breath for a COVID-19 vaccine any time soon, however like you I can only hope they do so we can all get our lives back on track sooner than later. 👋

5732	108846	@ChrisDokish If some people would just do a bit of research they would find a coronavirus vaccine has been in development for more than a  decade. It just had to be tailored to this specific strain. We are still waiting to hear when my practices will get doses for staff let alone patients.
5733	111719	"There is a layer of ""skin"" that separates our respiratory tract from the rest of our body. It's an exposed to the outside part. Injecting a vaccine and hoping it removes a coronavirus is like injecting a vaccine and hoping it removes the dirt on your arm..."
5734	109710	@RWMaloneMD Pandemics have run their course in the past without vaccines. In fact, no coronavirus/flu outbreak has ever been ended by a vaccine. They've all just run their course.But in 2021, the experts aver that the only way out is through intervention. It isn't honest.
5735	108695	This new strain so so bad, that they're happy to roll out the same vaccine as they say its still effective... 🤔 If you live in Wales don't listen to this clown
5736	108454	@WattersWorld @JesseBWatters Jesse,Here is an idea for a segment, but it will really take time to achieve.

5740	112884	And South Africans think getting jabbed will get us to go back to “normal”. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. Naive to say the least.
5741	110244	When we make individualistic decisions related to #COVID19--e.g., not getting vaccinated because of risks it may pose to us, hoarding vaccines to protect only ourselves--instead of considering the common good, the situation worsens. ...It's almost like there's a lesson in there.
5742	109279	Thomas is right: ‘Get jabbed! It’s so important to get jabbed as we head into winter. It’s so quick...’Quick? Why did Thomas have to wait months for this *important* jab?@nadhimzahawi @sajidjavid why did you deliberately allow Covid to infect his friends and classmates?

5750	109136	We can marvel at great technological and medical advances, and hope these vaccines are a game changer. Yet, never forget, there is nothing as miraculous as the dedication, empathy and selflessness of people like this. They are what hope looks like.

5754	201917	One for all and all for one. Let’s kick COVID-19 in the ass and get this world headed in the right direction. I just wish this had been the case from the very start of developing these vaccines.
5755	107715	Then why did all of you say you would never take a vaccine developed under Trump? You said it would kill people.
5756	110620	It’s just going to be really hard - if not impossible - to gather in public or in private - and not pass this stuff all over the place.  This spread is a new ballgame.  I hope it’s a less dangerous variant and it might be just that but I wouldn’t roll the dice.  I’d get the jab.
5757	110640	@udaysubbarayan I think Covid can be controlled to allow in-person work if there is regular boosting (until a sterilizing vaccine is developed) and masking if community spread is high. Best case scenario is Covid burns itself out to be a benign circulating coronavirus, but probably not likely.
5758	111929	I took the COVID-19 vaccines, but later found out they can weaken the immune system. I'm not taking anymore vaccines for Covid 19. They'll keep coming up with vaccine after vaccine. Don't trust Fauci, and the CDC

5761	112375	@rabbisolomons @WHO Maybe vaccine regulations are not made to deal with pandemic emergencies and need updating. The Russians may cut corners but they’ve had Sputnik so they’re not exactly stupid. I just don’t know except to distrust government on coronavirus as my default position

5783	112559	@rupasubramanya @EricTopol @UKHSA We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies. Ask the FDA about it.
5784	108126	Police and fire departments around the country have been doing everything they can to get out of having to get the covid-19 vaccine.I am writing on the latest.
5785	111788	The 'normal' flu season pattern is disrupted. Even if you don't normally get a flu jab, consider getting one this year.
5786	111615	@jdmuccigrosso @bylenasun @Fahrenthold @Carolynyjohnson Considering it’s untested on kids, untested on pregnant women, untested on the elderly, unknown if vaccinated will shed the virus, no vaccine has ever been developed for a coronavirus, no vaccine has ever been delivered this fast (fastest 7yrs), etc I wouldn’t give it to anyone!
5787	111412	Do you think a single person who was sceptical about getting a #COVID19 vaccine will now go get it after seeing this rubbish?
5788	110490	Got my #BoosterJab 3 hours ago, already having aches and pains and very tired. Go immune system go! #COVID19 #vaccinated
5789	112353	I'm going to preface this tweet with the understanding I file  #antivaxxers in the same coo coo file as #flatearthers.But, how are we okay with not knowing the long term effects of this COVID-19 vaccine? 😟
5790	202223	Today, I accepted my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Can’t wait to hug and kiss my grandparents again!
5791	108455	@TakeThatChem Does a vaccine even prevent Coronavirus?Don't people get the flu after receiving a flu shot? It actually makes them sick. It also doesn't prevent them from contacting the flu. Either way a tech mogul doesn't get any say about my health/ body.Simple.Period.
5792	112623	How do I know what they took was the vaccine? Why are you so focused on getting people to trust and take it? Anyone who keeps telling me to trust them cant be trusted 🤷🏾‍♂️
5793	108164	I definitely Want to take HCQ #Hydroxychloroquine now! Why has it been hidden from us all this time? It is a cure and vaccine for #coronavirus #covid19.  We want it in mass to the population!
5794	108731	@Alyssa_Milano The cat’s out of the bag the common flu is a Coronavirus yet thousands die every year with a vaccine Covid-19 may be no different The best you can do for your children is raise them to be strong independent and think for themselves they will be as strong as mine
5795	202281	GOOD NEWS! My uncle in LTC here in YEG got his first dose of vaccine yesterday at 6 PM! @ABdoc4patients I thought you would like that news ♥️ #vaccine #COVID19 #yeg #abhealth

5797	110317	Before that question? 1st to ask would be... ARE YOU READY TO TAKE THE VACCINE? It’s not mandatory but again will you take the vaccine?
5798	108347	@chris_notcapn Should be like auto coverage. Drive w/o it, get rear-ended into car ahead, then you get sued all the way around, for, the uninsured shouldn't be driving. If wilfully unvaxxed, w/o DNA test exemption, and pass COVID-19 or spread it, killing/impoverishing others, WOE be unto you.
5799	109771	Such completely irresponsible journalism and social media from this Sinclair owned station. It presents two random folks saying they won’t take the vaccine because “someone had bad side effects” and “I don’t get the flu shot,” but then offers nothing to address their fears
5800	108995	@YoYoBitchHeyHo Ferrets, biologically closest to humans, died in previous attempts to produce a coronavirus vaccine. Just saying .
5801	109076	@SuzeQKnits This far NOT one Doctor would Endorse the Russian Vaccine as a True, Safe, and Effective Targetting COVID-19 as a Proven to Work Vaccine.
5802	110964	What if the vaccines 'don't work' and this winter spells carnage in our communities, wouldn't it be urgent to follow alternatives that 'could work' if not suppressed by parasitic classes + their media?👉The courage of these👇doctors facing malevolent forces is extraordinary 👏

5805	109754	@SaksithCNA Since a vaccine for coronavirus has never been invented I don’t hold out much hope on this one too. Oxfords vaccine has already failed in money’s.
5806	112225	@FrankFabian63 @CharleyTakaya Get this - the Rght is afraid to get a Coronavirus vaccine when it’s available because “there will be a chip in the vaccine.” Some call it the mark of the beast.Who’s more likely to be correct, Liberals or Conservatives?
5807	109715	@mlilleker @Steedore @LPerrins So why bother ? Ivermectin cures Covid symptoms n hours ? Why are they withholding the cures and pushing an unsafe untested useless vaccine ? Does that not throw up a red flag to you ? 🚩🚩#Covid19
5808	107847	There’s a good side to this coronavirus crash but after March next year, if we don’t have the world needling up with a vaccine, then even this optimist could join the pity party that gets drunk on Twitter every night.#COVID19 #Retail #Spending #Recession #Stocks #ECommerce
5809	110867	last time i got a shot i passed out, but i’m still gonna get the COVID-19 vaccine because i’m not fucking stupid. why is this even a discussion we’re still having
5810	112906	@jamiedupree I am guessing that the GOP faithful will use this to say the vaccines don’t work so no use getting it. Also that the CDC said the vaccine would stop COVID-19 but it didn’t, so they lie and we should not listen to them on masks either.
5811	110460	Can someone explain to me why, if you’re vaccinated, are you all standing in long lines to get tested?  Seems like if you’re sick that you’ve just spreading Covid around.  #CovidVaccine #COVID19
5812	109293	"@mmpadellan #COVID19 is a virus, and #HIV is a virus."" Herd immunity "" has not cured HIV.So why does @realDonaldTrump think "" herd mentality "" is going to cure #COVID19? And we're supposed to trust the ""vaccine"" he approves?Bleach?Disinfectant?Oleanders?#TrumpRally #MAGA #Biden"
5813	110381	@WHO I don't think people should lose their job because they're not vaccinated I think if you can't get the vaccine shot you should at least get the coronavirus test but another every week then come on government stop that even people dying with the vaccine shot so now what
5814	202353	@TRR1934 @BostonGlobe @bostonherald @MassGovernor My VA doctor knows that I want the Covid19 vaccine. The Lebanon VA Medical Center converted the gym into an injection location. Have to wait for my category to come up. USAF Vet with COPD, puts me in a higher level.
5815	110922	@8NEWS @GovernorVA @VDHgov Why do I need to get vaccinated if I've already had it? Don't tell me because we don't know how long it lasts, because we don't know how long the vaccine last! Or the side effects of either #COVID19 #vaccine
5816	111047	The coronavirus vaccines have only been developed for a year. No one knows if it will be safe for the next 10 or 20 years. It's a hoax that they are safe.
5817	112682	Black and brown residents in Prince George’s County account for the highest rates of COVID-19 in the state! Why is it this hard for my 70 year old Aunt to get a vaccine?
5818	111552	@JenTromans @o_rips Actually he is claiming that the new Covid-19 vaccine will cause GB. Believe it or not, that just isn't true. Covid-19 infections can cause a resurgence in people who have had it or currently do, but not the vaccine. Honestly anti-vaxxers blow my mind.
5819	112045	@EddieRNashton Where’s your evidence you can be reinfected? Getting infected by delta and then Omicron is two different viruses so not “reinfected”. The common cold is a coronavirus. Why would a virus with 50 mutations be considered the same virus? If you’re not immune, vaccines won’t work.

5821	110441	Definitely to the ones that's telling other officials to shut up because they feel it's to early to open Texas back up so you walk maskless through the pandemic please don't panic and bomb rush the lines for a vaccine when you get coronavirus
5822	112463	When the time comes I will not take the covid-19 vaccine because biologically it has the ability to alter one's genetic make-up. My body by default has the ability to replenish any wornout tissue.

5825	110409	@RubinReport Which is EXACTLY why coronavirus vaccines NEVER made it past the animal studies previously; enhancement caused them to get gravelly ill or die when exposed again (cytokine storm!) They are making it sound ‘normal’ so we don’t trust our gut instinct.
5826	201915	#OnTheNews: Talking about employers mandating employees to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Don’t know about you, but I really do not like mandates. Especially when it comes to MY healthcare. Even now, just imagining the scenario playing out, I can feel my adrenaline pumping, and am https://t.co/Jvtn9DmAmO
5827	108738	@my_own_RESEARCH @MockDelbourne @SmallRedOne That’s not what she is saying - once the world has been exposed to the virus (via vaccine or infection), the IFR will most likely trend similar to influenza, if not less.  Yes, this is horrible and a terrible experience for all of us, but structurally, this is a coronavirus.
5828	111369	You are NOT safe from COVID-19 after you've had it -- just like you aren't safe from the flu after you've had it. The flu changes so you can catch it again. COVID changed and will again. That's why vaccines exist; because our bodies can't achieve immunity alone.Get vaccinated.
5829	109834	I'm not rooting against the COVID Vaccine, because I do think they have a purpose for those that are vulnerable....but this is not good.
5830	112180	I hope with this money the government WILL make testing and vaccines FREE and AVAILABLE to every Ugandan. They owe us this. It’s the least they can do!!
5831	110399	@plyons45 Paul, my cousin's son is a consultant in respiratory diseases and when I spoke to him about feeling unwell after my covid19 jab. He said it was a sign that my immune was working well and to take paracetamol. My feeling unwell passed after 48 hours.
5832	202449	Getting my COVID-19 vaccine this morning in @myRichmondHill was quite possibly the most seamless appointment I’ve ever had. Literally in and out in under a half hour (including the fifteen minutes post vaccine) #vaccinated #pfizered
5833	108198	"@FreeGirlNowNYC @ErinCatTX @GregAbbott_TX Haha physics..... k so....forget ""physics"" let's do math: coronavirus is about 0.12 microns in diameter...the only mask that filters out 95% (not 100%) of the virus is a *properly fitted* N95. The vaccine doesn't keep you from being infected or transmitting the virus either. 1/2"
5834	112106	@LL4DJT @DiscipleBearded COVID-19 Vaccines are bad for you. They are still in there trial stage. If needed take ivermectin and you will be good to go.

5837	109446	I scheduled mine and Sam’s COVID-19 vaccine, I’m in the process of booking my ceremony venue (really it’s just getting a permit), and I woke up before 7am and got Sandy an early morning walk #DoingWork
5838	111876	Last year I spent my birthday in lockdown due to a virus we knew little about except that it was bad.This year I’ll spend it having just had my first vaccination jab against that same virus.How good is science!!!
5839	202037	BTW, both my great-grandmothers died in the 1918 pandemic (my father never knew them).My uncle died of COVID-19 (pre-vaccine).My friend's dad died of COVID-19 (pre-vaccine).No joke. Get vaccinated or/&amp; wear a mask in public (if you can't get vaccinated).That's it. Seriously.
5840	108680	@jamesjbernard @asip Unfortunately I have to break away to go get my first COVID-19 jab (yay!), but it's sounding great James!Hoping there's a physical release and it shows up soon at #StellarRemnant so I can pick it up in person?
5841	108984	"Are the so-called ""COVID vaccines"" ""leaky""/don't provide immunity? If so, why should anyone get jabbed?"
5842	108247	People refusing Coronavirus vaccine but are all good with a 2 for 70 of fuck knows what going up there nose every weekend. Each to there own like
5843	108340	I am not anti vaxer in general. I,my kids as well,got all regular vaccines so far. I am  against deadly #COVID19 vaccines and correlating measures 100%.I drew that line looooong time ago.Thus far and no more MOFOS.Only over my dead body. #JustSayNo #Nuremberg2 #wewillneverforget
5844	110100	@mike61400 @zerohedge They claimed you would never get covid-19 if you got jabbed and I have the video to prove it of what they've been saying all along.Time to ditch the Sheep heard before the slaughterhouse.

5846	112116	Question for ethicists: would it be moral to pay $10,000 to each volunteer in a COVID-19 challenge trial (where you are purposefully infected in a vaccine trial), $100,000 if they get sick &amp; then $10m to their families if they were to die? Explain why in a reply
5847	110804	I'm sorry but there will be no stream tonight. I received my first Covid-19 vaccine yesterday and I'm completely drained. Once again, I'm sorry such short notice. I hope everyone had a good night. Love you, nerds. #twitch #streamer
5848	111863	@hellowolkenfeld @boatbuilder369 @sallyKP @CNN When those trolls get vaccine injured children, they will join our club. I don't think we need to wait for too long bcs COVID-19 vaccine is flying✈️ on it's way

5850	112159	Greg how is that pommy vaccine going hmm thought so another CANBERRA bubble lies and false hope again keep up the good work wanker
5851	108390	Let's also pay attention to the timeline for #access going from the first HIC deploying the vaccine until the poorest country receiving the doses. And from the very first person with access until the last person getting it's shot. No one is safe until everyone is safe!
5852	202207	Second #COVID19 vaccine done ✅ as always @NHSuk service is slick and friendly. Even had the same lady as last time who was brilliant with the needle. #COVID19Vaccination
5853	111003	@bellamadison22 @JamesR2544 @thehill No, but it came out very quickly when it was being developed. This vaccine for Covid-19 also isn't new, we've used this same exact technology for multiple decades, we've just decided it's bad now for some reason despite it not being bad for the MMR vaccine in 2000s'
5854	201952	@Marumo_Mokgaga @HealthZA But procedure and training we got more especially for this covid19 vaccine. The whole thing is just so wrong.
5855	109246	Oh wait I think I know, it's because when you get the real coronavirus then you usually don't feel any symptoms within the first 2 weeks of infection. So that means the vaccine is working the way it should.
5856	110302	@SilVeRWiNg947 @GatekeeperLabs @NatGeo Coronavirus vaccine is an 'RNA' vaccine, the first of it's type. You can't post videos of 'DNA' vaccines. It's not relevant to this story as it's a different technology.Please, do some research...
5857	112147	You notice that @GovMurphy has yet to take the vaccine. Keep tabs on all of these individuals especially their names that are taking this so-called covid-19 vaccine and see what happens to them..
5858	108238	Isn’t this going against all of their established safety protocols? How did 18 months go to 12? They don’t even have a viable vaccine yet. WTF? I think I’d hold off.
5859	108383	No way the coronavirus industry ever wants this pandemic to end...it is a near quandary for all of us, save for the vaccines
5860	110749	@sr_patrick Actually I have some information on that subject. I thought originally that covid and the flu are just separate coronaviruses has but apparently the flu is NOT a coronavirus so it's a totally separate vaccine according to a pharmacist I talked to you last week.
5861	111685	"@realDonaldTrump May 8th (80,202) Trump's says,""The coronavirus is “going to go away without a vaccine … &amp; we’re not going to see it again, hopefully, after a period of time.”June 17th (122,632)October 30th (235,159)Trump &amp; family hold Covid spreadfests around the USA.They don't care!"
5862	111585	@refinedmanxxx @DominicEvans23 @EscapeEUSlavery SARS 1 didn’t have a vaccine neither did MERS. Both just disappeared. There has never been a vaccine or anti viral for any Coronavirus. They have be a few out breaks in the last 20 years

5864	109984	@toad_spotted We're going to have to figure out another way to make babies anyway. The coronavirus vaccine is going to sterilize everybody.
5865	201950	@PoorFlyingMan @NeilClark66 You've got it bad my friend. Try and digest the fact that 130,000,000 injections have achieved nothingThat's jab inefficiency.Then the complications, like myocarditis &amp; Clotting etc.Read the covid surveillance report.More likely to die of covid19 if jabbed 😕
5866	111868	We are getting started on the vaccine deployment that we promised.  It will take time.  But we are getting started.
5867	110325	@helpmebcatholic @cmsorrps4610 @FrMatthewLC 1\ A mutated version of COVID19 will not make the necessity of vaccination moot. It might make the vaccine slightly less effective is all.Yes, COVID19 has already mutated slightly this year but I've seen no evidence that it will seasonally mutate like the flu.
5868	112055	So, if a non-US country develops a vaccine first, then the US will just have to cross its fingers and hope for the benevolence of countries and organizations that our government has spent the last 7 months antagonizing...
5869	112698	Absolutely disgusting. Who in their right mind would volunteer their child for vaccine trials? #VaccinesHarm
5870	110058	I don’t understand why y’all go through all this trouble to fake a covid vaccine card (then not do it correctly and get caught) when you could just, and hear me out….GET THE VACCINE.
5871	109100	"Children will be able to overrule their parents and get the coronavirus vaccine if they are deemed “competent” to do so, a minister revealed today.They've repeated the line ""listen to the science"" the full time, scientists advise against it yet ministers are still pushing"
5872	202215	So . . . my crystal ball was correct for the very first time during the entire pandemic.  Today, #SCOTUS sunk the #OSHAETS mandate, but threw a lifeline to the #CMS vaccine mandate so it could be enforced.  I just wish #covid19 knew the difference! https://t.co/Y4850uFLnZ
5873	107793	@CNN No one can legally force another to take vaccine in US but its their own lives and no one can assured that vaccine is 100% safe without side effect in years to come but if they aren't careful with SOP and catch covid-19 and then die, it's their own funeral anyway.
5874	110003	Croydon is one of the first places to receive doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. Croydon residents, will you be getting the vaccine when it is offered? #croydon #vaccine #croydonvaccine #CovidVaccine

5876	108456	@sdr_medco The way orange moron handled this pandemic, most likely. Also it will probably be another 18 months (thereabout) before we actually do have a legit med or vaccine for Covid19, &amp; as long as moron opens biz and veto stay home, virus is not going away. Why doesnt he get it?
5877	109747	PCR tests don't fucken work just like those fricken masks why are they still wearing one if they have the jab,please explain fucktards.
5878	109248	Lmao. We've been sitting around waiting for a vaccine knowing damn well they're gonna make sure it's unaffordable when they figure it out.
5879	109332	We don't need a #Vaccine against #Coronavirus #Covid19 #Covid1984.We need a vaccine against government.

5881	111442	3/ tried to develop the vaccine for the previous 2 famous coronaviruses, SARS and MERS? Ever wondered why there is no vaccine for those (or any other coronavirus)? It's just because.The pharma companies have said it is safe and when companies that stand to make so much money...
5882	108790	@Jajafinance it's still not working. My details are correct, but the app and website keep saying they're not, and getting through to you on the phone is nigh on impossible. Any other suggestions?#EpicFail #JaJaBanks

5884	112110	Ohhh... I really want to see a vaccine but I don't know if I want to be a guinea pig (read: am brave enough).
5885	112594	@PorcupinePink @julesspaceman @afowler06 Coronavirus vaccine has been around almost 2 decades and studied for far longer. SARS and then MERS both coronavirus have vaccines. Covid or SARS-Cov-2 is a just a new strain of corona virus which is why the turn around for a vaccine was so quick.
5886	109376	If the coronavirus vaccine works I wonder if it would work on the haunta virus? I think that's how you spell it
5887	108052	It's like David Icke was sayingThey can make up any symptoms for this virus to enforce a new ruleThen they will do the same for vaccine deaths
5888	202133	I just took my 87 year old mother, for her COVID-19 vaccine yesterday, at the federal location on Waters in Tampa, she was asked to present her ID during EVERY step of the vaccine process, I feel I should be upset, because, asking for an ID is so racist😬

5899	201935	I am ready to call for vaccination centre for my first COVID-19 jab!! 8am it opens. Let’s hope I can get through today
5900	111070	@ABC  Keep the Virus thing going just when all those that took the Vaccine, both doses, are in the Hospitals with the Virus.  So now we are going to push this one Huh.  Can't go without a Virus a Month Plan...
5901	110046	I hope parents are watching carefully… why are they trying to do this “quickly “? Why do they want this in your kids… you can not undo this vaccine!

5903	112146	Despite your personal beliefs and political standpoints, I think we can all agree that if a safe and effective vaccine is actually distributed starting in October, that would be great. I mean the least we can do is hope.. right? #cppCOM1101
5904	111900	When does it END? THEY HAVE NO PLANS ON AN ENDING. It is about the money! If after 3 jabs + future ones AND pills. It DOES NOT AND WILL NOT WORK!
5905	112187	Why don’t you trust doctors and nurses? This is why. You have no business being in the medical industry having anti-vax beliefs. Plus, I’m happy watching nurses in the US get fired or quit their jobs over this vaccine. We don’t want you treating us.
5906	109835	Except it’s nothing like the measles vaccine, is it?I had all the aforementioned vaccines too. As far as I’m aware, they were actually safe and effective with years of clinical data to back that up.
5907	202320	What a Friday! Did a two-hour interview on medical history and living through a pandemic this morning, and this afternoon I'm off to get my covid19 vaccine!
5908	108333	"People are getting mad at this for no reason. If someone mocks vaccines then it's okay to mock their death. Just seems like generic twitter contrarianism to go ""no actually, we need to mourn this guy who was putting everyone in danger by not getting vaccinated"". Fuck off"
5909	112717	@paulofthewoods0 You’d be correct if by “vaccines work” you mean they are 100% effective. Unfortunately coronavirus vaccines (like the flu) are not. That does not mean they are useless either. That’s why the more people take it the more effective it is overall.
5910	110281	Vaccine or No Vaccine?Not being close to the top of the list will make that decision for the majority of us so don't trip.If there's any issues with the vaccine, they'll be known before it's our turn to get the shot(s).#COVID19 #CovidVaccine
5911	109329	@WendyLo86145831 I agree... people should say if they want to be vaccinated or not... some countries - like Germany - using vaccines from different countries... hope all vaccines are good and helpful, and the coronavirus can be controlled the way its possible.
5912	111668	You advertise for vaccines. Lol I doubt the average person is going to believe a word you say. Conflicted.
5913	111368	If COVID-19 was as apparent in humans, there would be zero vaccine hesitancy. Still, COVID-19 is probably more devastating on the human population than the worm is on the snail population.
5914	111756	@DrRPNishank Please sir postpone neet itna I am covid19 positive my parents will meet me to make me approach center and they have some health issues if you postpone neet the vaccine will be available in one or two months and please postpone neet I have lost interest in my life I am beggingsir
5915	111313	How convenient China creates the virus, covers it up, and now China may be the first to have a vaccine#ChinaMustPay #COVID19 #WuhanVirus #Trump2020
5916	112193	@LeeSovaClaypool I don't think we should widely distribute any COVID-19 vaccines that are developed...it wouldn't be fair to the people who've already died from the pandemic. 🙄
5917	110109	Why does J&amp;J need to repeat every day how vaccines are going to save humanity? If they were so good you wouldn't need to spend millions every day to advertise it.
5918	112348	If anyone has any doubt about how effective the Covid-19 vaccines COULD be if everyone got them, in the state of Indiana...
5919	109363	Good explanation of why this is NOT a conspiracy re the AZ vaccine. (And loved the yogurt analogy - vindicated !!)
5920	201848	Yesterday, I received my first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The fine folks working at the Circuit of the Americas site did a great job of making the process seamless and easy. I'm extremely grateful for all that went into this and feel hope for the first time in a while.
5921	109268	"So the Science Minister doesn't know if CSL actually has the ability to actually manufacture a Covid-19 vaccine if one is found? She's been ""advised it could be possible""... Jesus. 🤦‍♂️#insiders"
