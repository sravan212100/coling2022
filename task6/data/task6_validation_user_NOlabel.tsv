107301	Given that the average survival rate to this virus is 99%, who will take the vaccine? I sure won’t. Never took a flu vaccine either.
105412	@FrDaveNix I hear belief in the virus will be added to the Credo.I believe in one coronavirus....and its only begotten vaccine.
201657	The CDC recommends receiving your second COVID-19 vaccine dose three weeks after getting the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and one month after receiving the first Moderna shot. But what happens if you miss your second vaccine appointment? https://t.co/JZ5bRrdNpf
107587	Just in case you’re wondering. I’m never having the vaccine. Whatever if threatened or offered. I’ll die before I take it. #COVID19 #covid1984 #vaccine
106375	@EssexPR @sailorrooscout This is very strange though. We know the flu vaccine has only ever been 20-40% effective, yet a brand new coronavirus vaccine is effective not only for current variants, but all the new ones too 🤔
201665	A COVID-19 vaccine update:2,191 #Windsor-Essex residents have received their first dose only, while 9,888 have received two doses. A total of 21,967 doses have been administered to area residents.
106873	@Foward44 @NBSaphierMD It's far fetched to call this a vaccine when it doesn't even give you any immunity to catching the disease unlike actual vaccines. And besides, needing 3 jabs a year too is just ridiculous for a 0.096% mortality rate Coronavirus.
106338	@realDonaldTrump Yes, but are humans too Mr. Trump, The coronavirus is burying all American warriors. They have the technology to go to the moon, but to find a vaccine they are screwed.
107068	@nshealth When is the Covid-19 dashboard going to be updated to reflect vaccine uptake in the 5-11 year old group?
201513	#COVID19Vaccine side affect; soreness and swelling in my arm and insanely vivid and crazy dreams. Holy shit in one of them I was a beast 😂 lol #COVID19 #CovidVaccine and I haven’t even had the 2nd dose yet
105466	I don’t even think why they’re refuse the Vaccine, At this point it’s like Kids Fighting Sleep, You know this is good for you, you just don’t want to be told what to do. #vaccine #Vaccination #COVID19 #CovidVaccine #GetVaccinated #GettheVaccine
201498	This afternoon @GovBillLee is at the White House for a COVID-19 Vaccine Roundtable. He was just recognized by @realDonaldTrump, and appears to be one of just a handful of governors in the room.
105471	@DebraG_Robins No, but given the process usually takes 10 years plus and we have never produced a vaccine for a coronavirus, I think 2 years is optimistic.
106093	@Sheepdog_89 @yourclueless2 @GovMikeDeWine Are we breaking down into absurdities because me being rational was too hard for you? Colds have medicine. Flu has a vaccine. Coronavirus does not.
106353	@SportsnetPR It is wholly irresponsible for your broadcasters to be saying that people need to make their own decisions about getting the COVID-19 vaccine. They should either encourage everyone to get one when it’s their turn, or say nothing at all.
106520	@thebradfordfile @MsAvaArmstrong It's a distraxine. No vaccine has ever been approved for a coronavirus (35% of common cold viruses)We don't need one (99.9% nonlethal)The test is whether you have testes or not.
105928	"""I am speaking out because to combat this deadly virus, science -- not politics or cronyism -- has to lead the way."" - Rick Bright, after he was abruptly dismissed from leading the coronavirus vaccine development team because he wasn't aligned with what the @POTUS wanted to do!"
107164	@JanssenUS I spent 5 months last year in the hospital and nursing facility didn't get COVID-19 my doctor told me never get that vaccine i don't like vaccines and never needed one
106343	The hoarders will see how a vaccine doesn't care what's in storage, and those countries where it is unavailable will continue to impact the vaccinated countries until Covid is eradicated. #VaccineApartheid
107657	"Coronaviruses are in every animal so if you've ever had a flu vaccine you were injected with #coronavirus"". Wonder if this is why #fluvaccine is being pushed so enthusiastically this year in the UK...2nd wave 'n all that..."
105921	@HummelTown @MattWalshBlog Do you get hepatitis, polio and measles after you have gotten the vaccine?   Can you still get COVID-19 after the “vaccine??   Hello!!
106368	if this is true then 1) the vaccine doesn't work and 2) we were lied to and 3) do we really want to do the NEXT insane thing they try to make us do? I sure as heck don't!
106065	@urkagurka If some already had prior immunity, like my 89 year old mother had, It's lasting and we have nothing to worry aboutOnce encountered and recovered from any of this crop of Coronavirus variants we don't need a vaccine at allIt would not give benefitClear enough now
107026	@courtlynn30 - 2I'm actually think, maybe I go out and get Covid19, so they will FRICKIN' leave me alone when the Mandatory Vaccine comes....
106444	Um, did they need a placebo group because they didn't know the effects of Covid19 with no prophylactic treatment? If so, they are the wrong group to be putting together any vaccine I would be willing to try.
105835	@thehill Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
105421	First refugee in the world to receive a coronavirus vaccine was in Jordan, a country of very limited resources. What an inspiration King Abdullah is to the rest of the world.
201500	Got it today. First jab of Covid19 vaccination in PHC Bhagwati Nagar. Thankyou @narendramodi ji #IndianScientists #RakeHangloo ji and @BJP4India https://t.co/plCYsIoxlm
106726	At this point anyone still telling people not to get the Vaccine or not to take the #coronavirus seriously is just a platinum certified idiot and should be treated as such...the #media should stop treating them like folks with a different opinion.They are simply morons
106079	I love this. As soon as I can find an appt I should be able to get my #CovidVaccine too. It's been a week since I became eligible as a person who is immunosuppressed.
107078	Trending that 30 crore Indian's should get free #COVID19 vaccine  free of cost. Then rest 102 crores? Which system is it? Don't understand. We want vaccine for all Indian's. ❤#VaccineForAll #Covid19India
107159	@angrypengu1n They are eluding to “they can’t force you to get it, but they can make continued employment conditional on getting the #Covid19 #vaccine” which I thought was essentially coercion.
105636	@SKyriakidesEU @AstraZeneca Those vaccines do not work on a new virus/strain. How many different/vaccines do you want to be injected?  Two or three or 5? If you do, then think of an pig experiment. Those coronavirus is a new beginning. The rest will be a real racing.
106712	"You can't keep locking us down until there's a vaccine, you imbecile. You have no idea when that will  be, or even if it will ever happen.  Personally, I feel as safe as I ever have, and I owe you nothing. There is no ""we""."
105565	If COVID-19 is so deadly why is it that the BAME who are refusing to take the vaccines and refuse to social distance aren’t all dropping dead🤔
105856	So, in other words, if you want your life back then vaccinations become mandatory?? @InstituteGC you actually want to take away people rights to do normal things if they don't have the vaccine?? This is insane!! What has this country come too...
105854	Wait a minute, how TF does this work?Is the goal here to help the vaccine recipient or the vaccine creators?  @PsychSavant
107368	Just wait until they start with the worst coronavirus yet when they blame it for everyone dying but it really was the jabbathehut
105597	@QuestionerMoney @Kean1S @allymaclusk @NicolaSturgeon Yes, I know flu has vaccines. Usually between 20% - 60% effective. My point being, even with a vaccine we haven't achieved elimination. There are reasons we've never developed a coronavirus vaccine other than not being able to. I don't doubt there could be a vaccine sometime.
105930	I’m certain this is going to be the only mishap in these vaccine rollouts. BUT GO GET ONE OR YOU CAN NEVER LEAVE YOUR HOUSE.
106510	The government’s policy on #COVID19 can be summed up as: “If you survive, or don’t get long Covid, well done. If you do, it’s not our fault. We’re not going to do anything to mitigate infections; we’ll keep our fingers crossed that the vaccines will save you’.Or: good luck
105400	@ellencarmichael People, including the government, need to stop waiting for a vaccine. It might never come. We've not been successful with finding good vaccines for coronavirus before. We need a different, realistic plan.
106071	Biden’s COVID-19 strategy for vaccine distribution and economy recovery is so normal that it is incredibly shocking to my system. That’s how bad it’s been. 100 million vaccines in 100 days is shocking to my system. That is all.
107486	Hey Alison would it be a bit late to submit “ name the first person who received the COVID-19 vaccine “ to the big  Christmas quiz this Thursday 🤔☺️☘️
106982	"@DrKND @apropoofnothing Speaking of the phenomenon of ""virus interference"",Dr. Rick Kirschner wrote: ""It's like a one-two punch. Flu vax sets it up, coronavirus delivers the knock out blow."" Or perhaps the coronavirus vaccine sets you up to be vulnerable to the next virus coming down the pike."

107433	@AlanRMacLeod @venanalysis @CancilleriaVE @maduro_en @camilateleSUR 1) to be fair, this is the appropriations bill, in which the coronavirus relief bill was tacked on to..2) BUT... $33 million to meddle in Venezuela’s business when there are hospitals in our country with 0% ICU capacity in a pandemic + not enough vaccines for everyone. okay!
105645	As someone who has had two jabs, I support the international vaccine programmeBut why is there a misleading sticker on this?
105941	“I am afraid — and people don’t like to hear this, but I’m kind of constantly preaching it — we have to prepare ourselves for the idea we do not have a very good vaccine. My guess is the first generation of vaccines may be mediocre.”
106357	@latimes I've some great examples too. I've a sister who keeps feeding my mom lies, and gets angry when my mom doesn't agree with her. She and her husband told my parents that Covid19 isn't real, that they shouldn't take the vaccine because it's a gov scam.
201580	so my external ovaries ARE supposed to swell from the Covid-19 Vaccine.. correct? Okay, good. Just making sure.
106673	The Vaccines to the Virus that Trump supporters think that is a hoaxThe Vaccines that Trump supporters will implant an microchip into their bodies..Honestly they are so insane that even though they think these things that they will applaud him for what he's said
105576	Got my vaccine. If I understand conspiracy theories correctly, I am now have the most recent Windows update moving through my bloodstream and will soon receive my recruitment orders to support my Lizard overlords. #COVID19 #VaccinatedAF
107441	@Vscarp20 If you’re not angry about COVID-19 you should get angry. This is not ending soon. This is only the beginning. They estimate this may ebb and flow for YEARS until we develop substantial herd immunity (or a safe vaccine is created). Years. Not weeks. Not months. Years.
201574	This is so very sad! “I trusted my government and they lied to me.” I took took the vaccine to protect my son, “taking the vax is like playing Russian roulette” His son died from the vaccine. #vaccine #jab #VAXXED #VaccineSideEffects #vaccineinjuries #Biden #BreakingNews #Doctors

107567	I'm starting to believe the left isn't actually taking the vaccine but pretending they are for optics!🤷🏻‍♀️
106576	TOMORROW!!! In September they said this “There are currently no plans to place restrictions on those who refuse to have any potential covid-19 vaccine.” Has anything they've done since them given you confidence they are honest?

107440	I certainly wouldn’t take it! I’ll take my chances with the flu thanks. #covid #putin #russia #vaccine
107427	@DonnyDonowitz10 @pmarkhemming Currently Covid19 vaccines are not included in the Government's vaccine damage compensation scheme. One has to wonder why.
107356	@bigpictureroxi I don't know if everyone realizes just how remarkable the human accomplishment of the Coronavirus vaccines truly is.
107053	So after vaccine, WHEN you get covid, you could have milder illness. But you’ll still be infectious SO you can still carry and transmit the virus. How’s that going to control the spread since vaccinated people are allowed to move around etc?
105903	@daosouthwest @simondolan The Pfizer vaccine has upwards of 90% effectiveness.So if you take it you probably won't get Covid-19.If you don't have Covid-19 you can't give it to anyone else.Seems like a good idea to me.
106972	Wow. &amp; good. @DeptVetAffairs is now making COVID19 vaccines mandatory for all heath care personnel. I wonder if/when they will expand the mandate to everyone working in a medical center like they do for the flu shot?
105738	So if the letters in the word Corona add up to 666 doesn't that mean that the Coronavirus is evil and from the Devil? It wouldn't mean the vaccine would be evil. The vaccine would be the opposite.
105480	@roper_93 We don't need a vaccine because he has banished COVID19.  No one else has become sick or died since he banished it. Thank Jeebus for Copeland! And for those who are going to come at me, this is sarcasm.
105650	@MoshPunksNFT hehe, I don't really love the Metal Zone(even though it can sound good when everything is fully cranked). My tweet was about getting the Covid-19 vaccine.
105468	It’s very scary that approx  50% of the British Population and American Population are crying to get fed their Vaccine 💉 , it’s taken a year to get this one approved, yet it takes 15 years to get a relatively reliable vaccine.. #Vaccin #hoax #COVID19 #usa #uk #Agenda21 #antiVax
106277	You can get a vaccine exemption if you've already taken the vaccine.Kinda like dunking a witch and if she drowned, she wasn't a witch, isnt it?
105778	Total USA population is approximately 330MM. What percent do you think will take any #COVID19 vaccine this year. Choose closest range.
106964	I’m disappointed but not surprised that there’s no way to register for the vaccine in the state of Virginia when you’re in a qualified group. @VDHgov @GovernorVA @MarkWarner
106242	2 weeks ago my family made the incredibly difficult decision to move my father-in-law into a nursing home amidst such strange and challenging times. Today he received his first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and I am so very thankful.
105575	Wouldn’t it be funny if China developed the first successfully affective COVID-19 vaccine &amp; tRump would have grovel to get it for the U.S.? They would share of course!
201619	Today I added a layer of protection against this virus with my first COVID-19 vaccine! I’m keeping myself, my loved ones and the rest of Ontarians safe from COVID-19. Thank you to Dr. Shivani and the entire team for doing an amazing work at Cornell community centre. https://t.co/IGyxAvsCpS
106376	@CDCgov I will not get the vaccine. I will go where I please. I will not submit. I've already had covid-19 and am alive and well! I was neither treated with nor prescribed a z-pak, antibiotics, hydroxychloriqine, or antivirals. My own 51-year old immune system was and will be sufficient.
105326	Why are politicians not participating in this #COVID19 vaccine trial? If they're meant to be looking after us surely they should be the ones who test it out first.
106870	@reubing @SarahJRossiter2 Curious aren't the flu shots tainted with the flu would that mean the Coronavirus shot is also meaning that a vaccine already exists and why important people are getting the virus
106602	So from what I’ve researched SARS, which is a coronavirus, just disappeared without a vaccine.Interesting.
106716	Black and Brown do not take a vaccine please be aware of it be notice My people May God protect and guide us
107499	Brazil has a very contagious variant. It's important that the US sends our best vaccines around the world to protect all peoples. Biden has made a commitment, but none will leave until end of June.
201682	The vaccine-induced reduction in my anxiety was starting to creep me out. Good thing I have good reason to feel so anxious again that my cortisol levels spike.
107523	I couldn’t articulate it exactly, but this is exactly what my complaint is right now with respect to the “debate” about boosters. The only questions they need to answer are: 1) is it safe? 2) will it help protect you?Then let people decide for themselves.
105279	as long as pi is everlasting there will be no effective and safe vaccine for coronavirus @LuciferDaily @federalreserve @ThelIluminatii
107525	@MelissaFloBix I actually meant what I said. I am ashamed to be a Finnish person and know that our government doesn’t supply Covid-19 vaccines to less privileged countries. Currently my country leaders hold the vaccines just in case they will someday give the booster shots.
106284	@sajidjavid can you please chase up the process for getting immune compromised people the third primary vaccine . There is a lot of confusion and no jabbing going on.#vaccine #COVID19 #needabooster
105386	Good news! Biden is doing such a great job handling the coronavirus that we don't need to take the vaccine!
106752	@JainNirmal Yes Mr Nirmal. However this prolly is beacuse #china already has a vaccine for #COVID19 . But yes sooner this will get resolved.
106137	THIS is why I'm really not in a rush to get the vaccine. Or planning on doing anything this summer. Or this Christmas.
106732	@TheEliKlein @CT_Bergstrom If you were trying to shield people from a static danger, say a toxic spill, the fix for the spill would protect everyone.  But Coronavirus is alive and constantly changing, quickly mutating to a form the vaccine doesn't stop.  (cont)
106204	@Ismwatcher_up @Chimmy31 @StarAdvertiser Oh, and if anyone had ever invented a single shot Coronavirus vaccine, they would be billionaires, because they would save farmers TRILLIONS. Doesn't Bill Gates research chicken coronavirus, hmmmm, wonder why, oh to make more BILLIONS!
107191	Just because the mandate has been lifted doesn’t mean I personally have lifted it for myself. Yes I am vaccinated. I just want to make sure I am safe so I will be wearing my mask until Ohio has higher vaccine numbers. It is my decision 😷
106564	@BriannaWu I don't agree with this second part. I had an adverse vaccine reaction due to autoimmune disease and the Covid-19 vaccine poses a risk to me, agreed by 3 doctors. That said, they wouldn't sign an exemption. There are a lot of us lost in this system.
201519	I’ve been on edge and frustrated all day. BUT...One glimmer of hope today is that my mom got her second COVID-19 vaccine shot. https://t.co/bFa1xaJr6v
107092	@djthefunkchris @aspidou @ksorbs Yea      BUT.    Over 150 million Flu shots are given out.... So unlike the coronavirus, which we have no vaccines for.... Get it? It's the flu without shots, gone wild.... You're an asshole too.
106586	Dear Jesus Christ,Please bring everyone back to normal, please doctor and nurse get the vaccine and booster vaccine for everyone and I need get the COVID-19 or coronavirus out of here so I want everyone to having normal lifeAmen 🙏🏻
106250	Hi this is Medium Roe Just wanting to let people know that this Coronavirus Plague is starting to mutate. My Spirit guide has informed me that three vaccines will be created and will not work. Why? Because the plague is mutating.
105308	Who truly cares what company or country makes the vaccine?As long as it’s made and distributed to every country for everyone. Why are not all the countries united in this global devastation #vaccines #COVID19 #Covid_19 #vaccine #vaccination #covidbriefing #PeoplesVaccine
105804	I see Spotify memes everywhere. I love Neil Young &amp; am a very big fan! I HATE covid19 as it took my healthy mom last yr. I am triple vaxxed. However I don't at all agree w the mandates because they do not stop the spread!! Yes they prevent serious illness.
106295	I DID IT!!! Got my second #COVID19 jab today. I’m sooo happy, and so relieved! Now, if they would just lift some restrictions soon, I‘m so fed up with  being confined to my home, work and the occasional walk. Fingers crossed for all of you who still need to get vaccinated. 😄🎉🍾
107178	"@HeyOhhnaa @eric_lombrozo Don't work - have you not noticed? They have been telling you a vaccine is on the way since the start.

105462	@ChuckCallesto I've had EBV since a HEP-B vaccine in 95'...it doesn't ever go away nor will I ever test negative for the anti-bodies.  The viral load can go up when it reactivates- So I'm trying to figure out how once you get a virus it just disappears. https://t.co/KBUHjF7inj
105764	@picardonhealth @GlobeDebate This 55 year old is not feeling burned at all - feeling incredibly grateful to have received my first AZ vaccine jab. And I'll be happy to get my second AZ jab tomorrow if I can. Last time I looked the AZ vaccine protects me from dying from COVID-19 #riskvsbenefit
107325	@x_xinhua This was to appreciate the work done by healthcare professional, not only in India but across the world, yes in China too.But some ppl just don't get it or dont want to understand it. BTW #WuhanVirus is not that easy to kill.Hopefully we will find a vaccine/medicine soon
106352	It's important to recognize that getting the COVID-19 vaccine is not safe because it was rapidly developed and tested.
106606	@DiscipleColin @wytewzrdz It's the reason we don't yet have a vaccine for HIV as ADE causes worse problems than the virus. It's also plagued every Coronavirus vaccine creation ever known, and yes 'they' knew the potential for ADE to be a prob with these new vaccines but went ahead anyway.
105300	@VMcIntyre13 @AddieCo76160156 @CMOH_Alberta Actually they are *incredibly* safe, even as vaccines go. Anti-vaxxer nonsense is not borne out by the millions of safely administered covid-19 vaccines administered so far.
107604	@kellieb926 @usual_suspect89 @AnaCabrera Is that what they do? Because I'm fairly sure we still have the flu, but there is a vaccine. It's meant to help protect you against dying or getting seriously ill, and to slow down the virus. It's unlikely that CoViD-19 will ever go away completely, but it can be controlled.
105966	Now that we know the risks, it's important those of us who've had the vaccine keep an eye out for any concerning symptoms. Please take note and share it around - the (VERY rare) clotting side effect is treatable if addressed promptly.

106364	"@rant_rn Thanks RN Rant! More and more people need to KNOW that the entire ""vaccine mandate"" has nothing to do with covid-19 as the ""virus"" was never isolated! There is no dead virus (which is their excuse for it) in the ""vaccine"" (provides no immunity)... ie IT'S NOT ""SCIENCE""!"

106361	@lizcabrera55 If I'm convinced it's safe, and it likely is, I'll definitely get a vaccine.  I don't want to get coronavirus nor do I want to spread it.  I suspect that the risks from the vaccine are far less than the risks from contracting covid-19.

107584	@DrZweliMkhize I don't know much about vaccines hey...the polio vaccine seemed to work...so maybe the Covid-19 vaccine will work if developed around more or less the same principles. I don't trust the conspiracy theories about the vaccine. If it's found I'll go for it...that's just me.
106015	@realTuckFrumper @DebbieParkes3 If we can coordinate to fight #COVID19, then we can work together to fix this too. I have no medical training, but I was able to put my IT skills to use last year to help, get researchers what they needed to develop a vaccine. I'm sure I can do the same again.
106128	Was there really a “reversal”? Or did DOH just stop counting in order for the order to be given to open up the economy. Is that when everyone started throwing away their masks? The cases are rising like gang busters now. DU30 wants to hand out free masks. Got vaccines???

201521	I feel like wooden planks are attached to my neck.But I'm done editing from Kisumu, where more like me are finally taking their first Covid-19 jab.I also engaged hospital administration and the Governor on how Western Kenya is averting an infection crisis.All across BBC today. https://t.co/GUgOXUIKrc
105507	If only there were vaccines available. I'm in the high risk group and I'm still waiting for my first shot.We should be getting ready to start protesting, except it's not safe because we haven't had our vaccines yet.
105639	The vaccine really amped up my Gen X apathy levels. Haha j/kNo really, the vaccine allows me to focus all my anger &amp; rage at anti-vaxxers thru my eyes.#MyVaxxedSuperPower
107370	@SaltaoVladimir @EastOfEpworth @lnstigator_ @BallouxFrancois Sorry, but vaccine data do not support your optimistic assumptions about resuming “normality”Sorry, but there is no point for herd immunity for this virus but endemicity The faster we allow the virus recirculates among healthy people the better
106373	"Not because of ""that"" because of a tyrannical disgusting creature like draconian inhuman consciousness that does not belong on earth. We are not your slaves. Vaccine cards don't belong in the human race nor do humans deserve to be injected against their will."
106951	@ricksokugawa No reputable person has stated the vaccine prevents covid19 100% but that, if one does contract it, the chances of dying from it or being really sick are drastically reduced.
105623	@bodhibrian @SkyNews this early vaccine development project has been a hope stable for the current vaccine being developed. Prior to SARS-CoV-2, there was never a major threat by coronavirus as the one we’re seeing now. So the urgency to create a vaccine for them was more warranted.
107011	A new jobA new pathA new company.But im still safe and protected from my key element my blood and immune system 2 of 3 parts to my coronavirus triangle. 100% fully unvaccinated with no drug treatment no vaccines. My blood and immune system is what's keeping me going strong.
105717	Don’t be ignorant, Govt has enough funds to deal with pandemic and vaccine . It is upto individual to take care
107618	"They've only had a ""successful"" COVID-19 vaccine testing and I'm already planning my vacations for 2021/22🤣"
105422	@NotAlexSheppard I will let you know tomorrow.  My daughter has had COVID-19 then got the vaccine (both shots) and now she has COVID-19 symptoms again. We will take her to get tested tomorrow.
201593	@BDUTT @DeShobhaa @tavleen_singh @DILIPtheCHERIAN For your information. We all senior citizens got vaccines, my daughter &amp; son in law of 45 and my granddaughter of 21 got vaccine in Gujarat. No queues, no hasstle. Thanks to our beloved PM @narendramodi
106610	I'm fully vaxxed but I still wear mask because one there is Delta variant and two I don't know if I'm an asymptomatic carrier when there are others who are not yet vaxxed. I was young and unafraid once so I hope the young and daring can consider others and get #vaccine

201746	Ahh! Reminiscing about the good ole days,  in back of a pick up truck or station wagon and your dad making it fun by swerving around and braking hard.  AND NOW, booking my #AstraZeneca vaccine shot. #genx #COVID19
107457	I just received the Pfizer vaccine to prevent Covid19.  I consider it #AShotOfHope. I hope it protects me so I can help keep my friends and family safe.  I really just wanna be able to HUG  my 80 year old Daddy soon!!!
106835	@catturd2 Luv you Mr catturd... but Covid is NOT  real.... it is only vitamin d deficiency and radio/cell tower sickness.  There is no covid19 virus because there are no viruses.  What we perceive as viruses are merely cellular debris. Beware the killer vaccine.
105380	Lol: It's not a waste, vaccine are 95% effective meaning it doesn't work in all circumstances. But it's better than zero % protection of not taking one. Normally those who survived virus will have immune but it's not always the case... It's complicated. #Covid19SA
105568	Okay. I know I have asked for a lot and Japan gov’t has ignored it all, but please please PLEASE may they stop ignoring the pandemic and approve this vaccine for kids super fast here. PLEASE.
105997	@ThomasEWoods There has never been a vaccine developed for any variant of coronavirus. I believe this will be the same.
107374	@notawokelefty @sailorrooscout @SteveBakerHW The human immune system has literally no reference for novel coronavirus. It only develops one once you either get COVID or you get the vaccine. And natural immunity is temporary, while vaccine immunity will be a lot longer-lasting if not permanent.
107298	Honestly when this Covid19 died down and a vaccine is found, everyone would treat it like a normal everyday influenza. So no need to panic at all.
107212	"Why is Fauci hesitant about a drug that we already have and can work to cure Coronavirus? Fauci is friends with B. Gates.  Is he stalling to approve Hydochloroquine because his ""friend "" is working on a new vaccine? Yet, Gates wants population control...🤔"
105744	Hey, @ASlavitt, it’s generally assumed a vaccine will help, but what is the current science on how much a vaccine really might help?*Will a vaccine truly result in immunity?*If so, how long will that immunity last?*Will it protect against COVID19 mutations?*Vaccine risks?
107134	Stay vigilant don't ease up don't become a stat. If you're not vaxxed yet...🤦‍♂️...get In the game. #Arizona
105285	Because if the government can't manipulate the young they'll pay the idols to do it for them..... we know the game which celebrity going to be first to push the new coronavirus vaccine saying they've had it and feel just fine 😂
107044	@JohnLukeSam1 I got the #COVID19 vaccine. I also like living, don't want to infect others, and I want to do my part to ensure #COVID19 doesn't spread throughout the country (it still is but I can't stop the deniers)  FYI: The needle didn't hurt. My arm did but only for a day or so.
107569	Lower drugs yes. But not a vaccine that has the Covid-19 virus in it.Read Creature from Jykell Island and Deep State:50 years... These people wants the population thinned out. Taking the vaccine could kill you any way
201722	Oh and you go home with a covid vaccination record card and a “i got my covid-19 vaccine” sticker (kinda like the  “i voted” sticker) haha 🙂
105212	It's too late! Hard pressed GP surgeries are already having to plan priority group 6. Just like the PPE guidance, unpaid carers are an afterthought. #unpaidcarers #vaccine #valuemycare @carersworldlive
105904	This article is fearmongering about the vaccine, under the guise that they don’t want to give antivaxxers more ammo. I’m taking the first COVID vaccine that my doctor says is safe for me and costs me under $100 after insurance. Even if side effects put me in bed for 3 days.
201520	Soon as I got the jab in my left arm my friend sends me a link to Costco nearby that has Johnson &amp; Johnson in stock so I can do a one and done. Got the J&amp;J in the right arm. No Covid-19 for me and I can continue to work.
105454	#nyct $alnov #avct #sng #tils #gdr Bill gates explaining why rushing the vaccine is problematic I will never use a rushed vaccine don’t care who makes it A normal process is 7-8 years bigger trials etc . It’s a dumb trial conducted by the pharma companies
106683	@AaronBlake @RonBrownstein The flu does not go away with a vaccine its still there.The coronavirus will not go away with a vaccine either,the vaccine will hopefully protect us from getting the virus .
105298	After we find the Coronavirus vaccine, can we work on an anti-moron vaccine? Blonks in Fluffy's replies truly need it.#LALISA #LISA
201616	Just tried to book my first and second COVID jabs online.I could get my first jab 2 miles from my house but I would have to travel 32 miles for my second jab when I don't drive.How the fuck is that going to help people get the vaccine!? Absolute mess of a system. #COVID19
105838	@SuzieWB101 假的Note: The above satire is fictional in that Mr.Gates has made no such speech and the Gates Foundation has not established any funds to compensate vaccine victims or to make available effective, inexpensive COVID-19 remedies. All the rest of the article is factual – W.Gelles
106834	Ok everyone it's been 6 months, even my degen gamer lifestyle requires some instances of social interaction once in awhile. Hoping we can get a vaccine/stop spread and get back to normal soon :(
105270	So who did they made it for when they don't even take it? People should never think of taking this poisonous vaccine
107443	@JpStrand27 It means somebody’s getting paid. 99.985% survival rate, even with the vaccine I can catch it &amp; spread it, so the vaccine literally does not make you safer. All the vaccine does, theoretically, is lower the severity of coronavirus if you get it. Like it or not this is the science
106630	I do not think the average public understands what ICU triage is. This is a very BASIC explanation: When there is not enough resources, staff or space to support you in the ICU, someone will live and someone will die. Please get vaccinated #COVID19AB #COVID19 #CovidVaccine
105777	I'm sorry if this isn't really a good thing to say but I'm not 100% sure if I want the coronavirus vaccine yet. I've honestly been really stressed lately and I don't think it's a good idea put even more pressure onto myself just yet, even though I am eligible for it.
106958	@POTUS Everyone, regardless of immigration status, should get vaccinated when possible. The vaccine is free, and there will be no immigration consequences for seeking COVID-19 testing, treatment, or vaccination. There is hope, but we can only get through the pandemic together.
107537	The issue is the people against vaccines who get covid won’t take these. It’s a good try but they will pull the same shit
106555	?????????good for them i guess??It's presented as though we're supposed to get mad about this but I don't really see why we should.North Koreans getting the vaccine is good, actually.
105275	Some people are actually refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine and while explaining their reasons why, they actually think this makes them sound intelligent.
105711	Seriously,  they have been running around without masks! And most are antiscience- so why would they think a vaccine will work?
107183	Why are all the politicians getting the vaccine when they didn’t do shit for us for most of the pandemic? Give it to the real heroes, healthcare workers, first. Not to mention giving it to the people who downplayed it 🤦🏻‍♂️
105340	Hope #vaccine and antidote to the #WuhanCoronavirus could be invented ASAP🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻   #WuhanCoronavirusOutbreak #Wuhan #coronavirus #WuhanJiayou #China #SARS #PrayforWuhan #StandwithWuhan
105460	This is good news.I assume they aren't allowed to carry the vaccine on the staircase or in the Long Room though.
106842	just a reminder that horseshoe crab blood is used in the Covid-19 vaccine, please try you’re best to help protect these beautiful creatures. if they weren’t as important to u before like they were to me they should be now 🦀
106883	@Lopez4VA Giving vaccines to everybody is the only way we are going to get past #COVID19.Those who complain about immigrants forget how much our economy depends on the work they do to make America function &amp; survive. They need to be healthy and taken care of just like the rest of U.S.
105891	Official petition to make masks a thing after covid too.I really like how it hides my ugly face.#coronavirus #CoronaVaccine
107343	When our Immune System is 99.95% effective, according to the CDC, why in the world would anyone take a vaccine that changes their DNA, not to mention the fetuses used to culture them...#AbortionIsMurder #COVIDIOTS #Covid1984
106117	Is it weird to feel that the basics like having a job and paying the bills don't feel as peak adulting as going to get my COVID-19 vaccine alone...I've always had Mama in every single one of my doctor's appointments. GP, OB, psychiatrist, therapist - you name it, she's there.
105931	So they have bypassed years of tests for the #COVID19Vaccine and to top it all off the virus is mutating. You cannot make a vaccine for something that then changes. The vaccine is then not only unsafe but useless.
106704	THE European Union is on the brink of coronavirus chaos as an Irish politician has called for the vaccine task force to be mandated to give unused AstraZeneca vaccines in France and Germany to IrelandHAVE A NICE DAY
106317	Tweets slating people refusing the potential COVID19 vaccine. I myself, will carry out my own research and remain objective at all time, it’s my body and my life. Therefore, my choice If I want this vaccine. There’s so much about vaccines people don’t know. Educate yourselves pls
201786	Here’s the gear I have to wear in my medical office in order to safely see patients. I’m about to get my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, and am so eager for EVERYBODY who wants vaccination against #COVID19 to get it. #COVIDVaccination @CBSThisMorning @CBSEveningNews @CBSNews https://t.co/trYSJ88dcq
201690	Good afternoon all my twitter people what a week covid-19 is just not giving up i had my Flu jab and came out with a bloody cold now. I have deleted about 8 fake accounts and my hospital appt got cancelled. I will follow back all genuine people. Now please Arsenal 3 points today.
107462	@janetlcardin @CBSNews There are seven known coronavirus that can infect humans. Four common ones,  plus MERS, SARS, and now COVID19.  We have exactly ZERO vaccines for the first six despite years of trying to make one.  What makes you think we will make one for covid19? You gonna live like this 4ever?
201765	The protection from the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is 89% and 95% after the second dose.https://t.co/cA5SuVsP0I#COVID19 #CovidVaccine

106159	What is the scientific research saying about this? And why don't they tell us about those who recovered without vaccine? 🤔
201595	my credit card debt is a direct result of the vaccine. i developed an urge to buy lots of clothes. it’s the vaccine’s fault and definitely not my own doing.
105877	@laurenboebert He’s probably got investments in the pharmaceutical company that is making the coronavirus vaccine. Now wants America to purchase enough for the world. But that stock just went way up
106315	Being from Bihar I think the politicisation of vaccine is Nonsense!!- Every Indian life matters- Free Covid vaccine must be given to every unprivileged citizen- If you give us Vote,we give it to you free. If not, then What?- Is Covid vaccine a commodity?#BiharElections2020
106304	@P_McCulloughMD After all there are 30 smthing different coronaviruses and flus that we fight w our developed adaptive immunity- Does covid vaccine replace adaptive response for all coronavirus / seasonal flu  infections we encounter going forward or do we get tht back at some point?
106540	@miramotamv @NPR I don't think you'll see the first one of any coronavirus vaccine until sometime late next year 2021. When they show trials, they give people hope that it will be soon but that's just not the case. They need a lot of testing, and then comes production and dissemination.
105495	@theRCN @HelenDon_RCN @buttynot @gallagher_rose @CNWLNHS Easy to get people to take the Flu jab this winter. Much more difficult to get them to take the Covid-19 vaccine next spring. To promote that poorly tested vaccine would be unethical, immoral and only legal because World Governments will change their laws to accommodate it.
105755	@RunJumpStefReid How would the vaccine be performance enhancing, compared with someone that is COVID-19 free?
107420	Gonna have to put my ass to sleep before they try and give me a vaccine ain’t no way I’m getting that.
106469	@realDonaldTrump you keep saying you're immune from COVID-19 since you have already had it. Why would you then need a vaccine? Either you're lying (you are) or you're stupid (this is true too)
105511	@_Mic_hael_ @JTyler36213241 @MMAFighting The research currently suggests that the antibodies will only last a couple of months. We don’t develop long term immunity to any coronavirus - this is why the flu vaccine is needed every year and we always gets cold - we don’t develop immunity.
106853	@MediaSequitur They certainly do not have our best intentions in mind. It is also illogical to make a vaccine against a zoonotic virus, one that T cell mediated memory immunity confers a strong response to across the Coronavirus family. SARS patients from 2003 have immunity to COVID19. This is
106482	I did post this on an anti vaccines thread as well as just posting it generally. Doesn’t seem like vaccine hesitancy is the big issue even if it is a small sample size
107424	Don't think I would. I was always against the flu vaccines but the corona vaccine would be no different. Don't trust 'em. They are 10x's more dangerous than a virus, in my opinion.
106921	How  do u know if   vaccines are effective?How can any1  predict if a person  can  get  infected or  not  in  the future ?BTW,  Covid RT PCR test kits  are  fraudulent and  they  were  made  way  back  in  2017  when Covid19 wasnt even  discovered
106004	@BuddyWinston Better yet, if the COVID-19 vaccine were called Super Soldier Serum that could make one powerful enough to beat up liberals, the Covidiots would take it. 🙂

105712	@squonkfart @LibertyNow11 @RealMattCouch @sutherland4thr U do realize they have been working on improving gain function for coronavirus in order to create vaccines? Our own government funds this research. My theory focused on people like Fauci &amp; Gates financially benefiting from this plandemic. They’ve got the world scared of the cold.
107585	@MaryLTrump Considering what a hoax the coronavirus is according to the GOP, it's unconscionable that they're lining up for the vaccine!
105727	@DailyCaller Surely no one should take this #COVID19 #vaccine. They will still have you in lock down and it will not even end the virus.
105790	Joseph R. Biden is calling for a total and complete shutdown of [J&amp;J vaccine] entering [our bodies] until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on [/figure out how to overcome the precautionary principle in simple cost-benefit analysis].
106139	There’s still a lot of testing to be done, but it’s some interesting stuff.  I got my flu vaccine because 1. I always do, and 2. if I actually got the flu anytime soon, I would be losing my shit until I was able to get a Covid test.
106496	@marketman52 @donnahot4Gaz Just curious... Did you get tested for Covid-19 or take the vaccine yet ??
105231	@LorimerPam I might be in the minority here, but I’m quite happy for my daughter to go back to school on 1st June. Coronavirus is here to stay. The risk level will be the same in September, and there’s no way a vaccine will be ready by then!
106045	My county is one of the red ones. All my neighbors now have COVID. They say they feel “fine” and so none of the ones not sick yet won’t get vaccinated. They keep trying to drop by my house sick bc they feel “fine”. I won’t open the door. I’m the only one vaxxed on my block. Ugh.
201646	@libshipwreck (nods)I imagine the implied assumption here is that the Covid-19 vaccine is Just Like The Flu.As in: You got to take your flu shot every year, so why not take this vaccine? After all, the Covid-19 vaccine is...Just Like the one for The Flu.😒😷
105578	"Did you notice the Ukraine health minster resigned because of, wait for it, a bungled vaccine rollout...? Linda Reynolds would certainly think Ukraine has too much ""natural empathy."" Meanwhile, the Liberal party has negative empathy, no accountability and zero competence."
106260	@sa_vvy_ What is this? Please stop! Get the covid-19 vaccine. We're in a time lapse in history; the polio or hepatitis B vaccines were developed in a time like this, &amp; now, every child has to take one. They aren't considered mark of the beast. Get the vaccine when you get a chance to, pls
201628	Let's do this guys and my Jelena2.0 fans let's do it for my girl Selena Gomez let's all end the pandemic once and for all and take the covid-19 vaccine so everyone can have their normal life back
105593	@rbrookbanks I still don’t understand why anyone thinks a vaccine is going to work against a coronavirus that mainly kills people aged 80+. Treatments will be the long term solution, not vaccines.
105807	@ConfusedTim @ansumDave @Quiggling @jonlansdell @Telegraph If. There is no guarantee nor has there ever been a vaccine for any of the 4 circulating coronavirus currently circulating.I hope it proves right but I have massive fear that it won’t be.
107166	My neighbors had people over again. They do it once, twice a week.I forgot to mention they live in the future, where there’s a vaccine for the coronavirus.
107255	If we don't get real about how dangerous Covid is, we will never get ahead of it. Viruses mutate. Constantly. Continuing research on vaccines &amp; continued mandatory masking protocols are going to be needed.
107036	@realDonaldTrump Is it 105b worth of coronavirus vaccine? Cuz that's what's preventing kids going to school. Republicans are holding us up on reducing cases, since they're hurt by a piece of cloth on their face.
106976	@Hricho151 @ThomasEvans1984 @alexblackmore67 I didn't say we wouldn't get hit again, as long as you maintain certain rules it will be manageable, masks, distancing, cleaning hands and so on.Herd immunity will save more in the long run because immune people can not be carriers and no Coronavirus vaccine has ever been made.
106254	There is a vaccine for the flu, but there are alot strains of flu. One vaccine doesnt cover them all.People still get the flu every year.If a Covid-19 vaccine is created, how long will it be good for? Will there be multiple strains a vaccine doesnt cover?
105405	@Zaggs @VerumVulnero1 If they all had taken the COVID-19 vaccine then we could just track them will Bill Gates’ microchip!Dotard!
107617	There were poor arguments for private companies requiring vaccines. There is no argument for government organizations to require it. I’m out of this hellhole state once my apartment lease ends. The South won the war.
106337	Folks are outside the hospital protesting against masks and the COVID-19 vaccine 💉.... Don’t get it if you don’t want it..... but for me and my household. I already got my first dose. Save a life. Wear a mask. #pandemic
106044	Religious and ideological extremism has no place in an ethical debate about #SARSCoV2 #COVID19 #coronavirus vaccine development. If you truly value human life, then don't stand in the way of a lifesaving vaccine, especially by justifying it with convoluted ethical equivalencies.

106735	I can't believe how happy and emotional I am that I just qualified to be eligible for the #COVID19 vaccine. No idea when I will actually get my first shot but at least I am finally eligible. I am sure I will have tears of joy when I finally get my first vaccine.

107348	@deNutrients @AV8intheblue while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections. Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria.
107224	I don’t get it. If your immune system fights it off at 98-99% what’s the need for a vaccine that has a lower rate ? I’ll wait. . . The same way abortions are considered a my choice my body deal I think these vaccines should be too. #mychoicemybody

105213	@ShareefYezdani @AribaShahid How long will it take to build immunity after getting the Covid-19 vaccine?It takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity (against the COVID-19 virus) after vaccination. It is possible a person could be infected with the COVID-19 virus just before or just after vaccination.
106858	To the fucktards that say the #covid19 #vaccine is safe, really? Came home from work to find out my aunt took the merderna one a few days ago, shes now in the ICU. Stop letting hte gov and sheep pressure you, its your body. NO ONE, not sheep, media or gov has to right to force u
107554	Thanks for this. Anyone who has #vaccine questions, this is a great place to go for solid #scienceupfirst answers @ScienceUpFirst @crackedscience @ScienceWithIve @SWC_Can @BogochIsaac @DFisman @YoniFreedhoff @Doctors_NS
107143	@bopinion Masks and problem solved. Seriously. Every nation has the ability to eradicate coronavirus. It’s like we already have a vaccine but people are just throwing it away.
107223	So are you telling me if I publicly announce my trust in vaccine and film taking it live, I too can skip the 6 months wait? 🤨🤔

107574	@repdelgado Protected the right to choose? If we want a Covid-19 vaccine in our bodies or not? No, no you didn’t.
106213	@Autarkh @RubberD63162804 @nytimes You still can get Covid19 after vaccine.You still can get Covid19 and die after vaccine.Covid19 is not going away.You will need vaccine every 6 months.In a few years vaccine will be a once a year with the flu shot.Stay safe enjoy your life.
106073	@PedroYokes @Platinumhorser1 @SwiftHitter @barshoelife That’s okay proof that’s what they want to tell you and no proof which vaccine works better do you lol I had COVID-19 and wAs in Coma for 3 months I’m not going to live my life in fear
106954	there is a flu vaccine yet for 35 years I have had to watch out for the flu. I cant have a flu shot and I would assume that I also wont be able to have a Covid-19 shot. So unless you're going to mandate everyone healthy gets the vaccine it will change 0 for me.
105436	I wonder how this is going to get resolved. It's hard to imagine a scenario where 70 - 85% of Americans voluntarily get the vaccine.In this age of contrarianism, it's hard to imagine any matter where 70 - 85% of Americans would agree on the resolution.
107665	"For anyone tempted to wait or to hold out for the ""best"" vaccine..For all ALL @CDCgov-approved #COVID19 vaccines so far approved:* The risk is tiny* Protection looks to be HUGE* The faster we all get the jab, the faster we'll get to the coverage needed to get back to normal."
106057	America now has the most % people with #COVID19 antibodies. USA Number ONE!Sadly, it means nothing for herd immunity. Studies already showed antibodies don't last very long. You can get sick again. Herd immunity is a myth without an effective vaccine.#TrumpCOVID19 lies.
105729	Why in the hell are we doing COVID vaccine trials on kids!?They are such low risk that this makes zero sense.We know the risk is exceedingly low if kids get COVID and the risk is unknown with the vaccine so we think it makes sense to give them the vaccine!?
105692	Immunocompromised immune system may not survive after vaccine because it contains mimic of corona virus, they use corona virus DNA to make mRNA Covid19 vaccine to trigger your immune system to produce antibodies against this virus.
106371	This is the single most important interview on the covid vaccine in my humble opinion. RT like crazy till enough people wake up
107268	Vaccine, Vaccine, Vaccine Everywhere! Hopefully, the Globe will soon be sufficiently served with enough #CoronavirusVaccine!
105635	"@dannysc305 A vaccine for this coronavirus will be the first one ever developed for any human coronavirus, ever.So, yeah, you're right.But, over time, these things typically become less lethal, because it's better ""business"" for them to do so."
106162	So who can explain how someone can get COVID last year, have antibodies for 8 months or so and has had the vaccine - yet they test positive today?! #COVID19 #confused
105515	@lsanger I dont need the COVID19 vaccine because I had a vasectomy almost 20yrs ago. And since I want healthy grandchildren, my children don't need the vaccine either!
107364	This is not good #COVID19 news on so many levels.That a doc died is a terrible loss in the ranks of lifesaversThat it's unknown how he got #COVID so as to know the vaccine efficacyThat we don't know if he had a placebo or notHe didn't just get sickHe diedHe was only 28
106622	@Katt2080 @amay206 @ChocChipPony @jkirk___ @elliequus THeY hApPenEd tOo fAsT!!!!They have been working on an mRNA coronavirus vaccine since SARS you twit
106860	So people should rather sit next to someone with a vaccine card who can still spread the virus, instead of sitting next to someone who has a negative test result and can’t spread the virus because they don’t have it? What a strange world we live in.
105684	@Cyndula @TheJordanRachel Yes it is when the vaccinated are getting Covid-19 again. There are probably multiple strains already around. Hence the new variant. Passing through that many people. This is why we have a new flu shot every year. The vaccines can control it. But we shouldn't have to get it
106515	??? The vaccine doesn’t prevent you from getting covid. I hope he doesn’t think it does. I hope no one thinks that.
107018	@WeWanttoLive5 @AlexBerenson In theory that's great if you have a vaccine or 90-95% have had it and are immune not enough is know about coronavirus to say anybody is immune people are getting twice
105808	@TheHugoMorales The WHO said a couple days ago that it will likely be around forever. This vaccine will end up being another flu shot. Idk why people are waiting for a vaccine to a coronavirus anyway.
107000	@ryanstruyk @AmoneyResists Well we don’t have to worry about distributing the vaccine to trumpers because they don’t believe the coronavirus is real.
105219	Listen, I am 💯 behind vaccines. Love ‘em. Got ‘em all. But is it bad that I’m very leery about any vaccine that might come out during this administration? Like, that I’d want to wait and see how things go for early-adopters?

107032	SARS has been around 18yrs- no vaccine yet. HIV been with us over 30yrs - no vaccine. Likelihood of effective Covid-19 vaccine within 5yrs -Zero. Only way out is herd immunity, antiviral drugs and protection of vulnerable. The longer we delay, the longer the virus will persist.

105330	@DCFresh23 The covid vaccine actually took years.  Coronavirus has been around since the 1930s. And since the 30s they've been working on vaccines and prevention. They really started working on it heavily when SARS was around. They just had to tweak it a bit to fit this strain.

105356	@DaniloDusoswa Not in the least, if it keeps us all safe then long may it stay, I’m one of the lucky ones who hasn’t lost anyone to this disease, and until there’s a vaccine then we just all have to adapt to our new way of life COVID19
106229	This is still less effective than the vaccine and you only take it if you test positive for Covid. This isn’t a substitute for the vaccine.

106544	they should have mandated vaccines from day 1, in NY we’re mandated to be vaccinated in order to attend school, why can’t they just add the covid-19 vaccine to that list, the honor system was never going to work lmfao
106160	y’all it’s so awesome to be able to answer “my colleagues are actually working on this!” to so many vaccine questions 🙌
107666	#coronavirus every religion says we are children of God then can any vaccines or negative news or being a loner living in fear can improve your immune when God has given us sun moon stars wind laughter everything to improve our immune naturally..think @duttsanjay @karanjohar
106261	Please be aware of this.The #COVID19 #vaccine is not like any other vaccine you have ever had.It is not something that can be called a vaccine if you check the contents.Please don't get hurt anymore.Do your own research.
106960	@BorisJohnson @bbcburnsy @looknorthBBC @peter_levy you say all the top 4 priority groups have all had the first covid Jab. This is not correct. I and my sister are in priority 4 and not even had a letter, text, or phone call to get one. #COVID19 #vaccine #VaccinePassports
107055	The only way Trump makes these coronavirus press conferences a positive is if he blows up Fauci and Birx for the frauds that they are. Bring in 100 doctors and have a true discussion about the virus. And forget about your vaccine. Otherwise, we’re back to where we started.
201598	@gillianlant @9NewsMelb Awesome seeing the first person to get their 3rd jab. Good on Roman &amp; I wish one of the members of VIctorian government witness that, like Scott Morrison did with the first ever Covid19 vaccine recipient.
105834	@PlatinumJab Sir, u said bharat and china will work together in the future. Is the coronavirus outbreak a step towards it?
106665	@LotusOak2 What are your thoughts on the Covid19 vaccine altering our DNA? Do you have any information on this please? Obviously when you google this every article claims this to be false but I still have my doubts
105444	@aslavitt46 @ASlavitt Dr. Slavitt, Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. You don’t know the science on this I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
107114	This is my first tweet about China. peoples are getting worst like Chinese people we humans have some rules for eating habits this creatures(Chinese people) will not leave any thing like dogs, batsetc., my conclusion is do something to China or please discover vaccine for covid19
201801	"This is concerning. ""The congressman had received a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and had tested negative for Covid-19 before attending President Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20, Tarpey said. But she did not specify when Lynch received each dose of the vaccine."""

So while this is taking off they're inviting and honoring each other, mocking Trump efforts to get a quick vaccine..."
106818	@Henrik_Palmgren I wonder if Ms Wu has heard of antibody dependent enhancement, the downfall of previous coronavirus vaccine attempts (SARS/MERS)? Having a more severe immune reaction on 2nd exposure isn’t necessarily the herald of a successful vaccine.
106414	Remember when we just had to flatten the curve? Then all we needed was a vaccine?What’s the excuse to keep it going now? #COVID19

107170	@therealCArjona Why do I get the feeling my niece has discovered the formula for the #COVID19 vaccine?
106104	The irony that a vaccine trial can be completed more quickly in the United States, because the pandemic is out of control in this country.  Scientists can get vaccine testing data rapidly.
107594	$GRTS We can’t keep getting booster shots every few months when a new variant appears. Outdated thinking and is akin to pulling up to a gas pump in a Tesla. Gritstone solves this.
107625	"""Russia has developed 'first' coronavirus vaccine: Putin""-With the added advantage that you can do 100 meters in 9.5 seconds!"
107539	h*******t. We’ve got vaccinated nursing home residents who are turning up positive for coronavirus. Vaccines and masks do not work. I repeat they are not effective.
107248	@AudreyManaster2 This is how the new vaccine will be produced, I think with changes in the coronavirus DNA genomes and why in some trials now they've been halted due to test human subjects having serious reactions. Why a rushed vaccine could have devastating effects. My assumption from readings.
106604	@ashtrei2 @GatesAnti So you wanna Die? If you want to die you don't need to make other people think #antivax is good. Just get tested on Covid-19 and get your Vaccine.It's that simple!
105847	"The easy part for them is that most Americans will line up the first day the vaccine is available.  The hard part will be getting the rest to doing them.  ""Persuading"" us won't work, and they know it.  And that's the hidden truth behind this story.  They know we'll fight it."
106202	If you’re in Kentucky or Indiana and need help signing up for a vaccine, feel free to reach out to me. I’ve had plenty of luck finding appointments for several family members and friends.

106245	@MattHancock @Peston @lfspinney @BBCJustinR why is no one talking about the inhaled interferon #SNG001 as the solution for #COVID19 this winter. We need effective treatments and a small British biotech has the answer. We need to protect ourselves THIS WINTER &amp; a vaccine isn't going to do that
105654	Not sure when/if I am getting my flu jab this year. Usually eligible due to asthma. Nothing on my GP website and NHS Scot only taking bookings for health care workers (using same portal as COVID-19 vaccinations). It’s important I get it so I can look after my baby properly.
106708	@AndrewMarr9 why is it taking so long to get the Novavax Covid19 vaccine approved, this excellent vaccine could ensure ample vaccines are available. The government has pre-ordered this vaccine, what’s the hold up? Ps I’m on the Novavax trial!
106516	They say that as if we aren’t used as pawns to reel our people in. 3-4 of their COVID-19 vaccine test subjects have already been diagnosed with Bell’s Palsy. It’s a no for me. Idc if every black person in the entire world took this vaccine, I would be the only one who didn’t.
105644	If it's true then it will be great victory for humanity against Coronavirus #vaccine #coronavirus #CoronaUpdates
107161	Okay, someone educate me now because what I just typed out makes sense to me, so I'm trying to figure out if the amount of push to get the vaccine has legitimate backing, or if it's going to be a short-term fix to COVID19 but the cause of something else that cripples us.
107286	gonna be disappointed if the coronavirus vaccine doesn't give me the huge butt and tits that the boomers say it does
106146	@JoeBiden all this stuff your doing isn’t getting the Coronavirus vaccines IN AMERICANS ARMS - who’s running this operation?
106846	@HeidiForLiberty @realDonaldTrump After only 45 years, the flu vaccine is administered annually. Many catch the flu anyway. So given both are Coronavirus’, why do we believe a vaccine will return us to normal. Listen to fauci, he is already questionin how many does are needed and the durability of the immunity.

201563	The first vaccine is out!! Fingers crossed 🤞🤞 that this will work just fine and many others will follow soon. Well done #RussianVaccine 👏👏👏#COVID19  #JaiShreeKrishna 🙏🙏
201544	Extremely grateful to receive the one-dose J&amp;J COVID-19 vaccine today at the @USArmy base in Yongsan, Seoul. Even though I’m #vaccinated, I’m going to stay masked and keep a safe distance to protect those around me. #VaccinesWork #WorldHealthDay https://t.co/sW5nkwyzEQ
107321	@NetflixIndia America reaction to Russia claiming that they have made the first vaccine for the Coronavirus Covid-19
105450	Vaccines seem to be failing pretty bad. Long as the virus is around it will mutate. Need therapeutics for a return to normal @ImmunoPrecise $ipa
105923	Covid-19 vaccine has the ability to change your DNA. Be careful don't take it. Besides covid-19 has very low mortality rate. You can survive without any medication.
106721	Whoop there it is. #TheWhitehouse will determine the efficacy of the #coronavirus Vaccine according to Brian Morgantsen Deputy Whitehouse Press Secretary. If it's not @FDA fuhgetaboutit, no American is taking this Vaccine.
105704	@tedcruz Same way it makes sense that COVID-19 denialists like Marco Rubio get a vaccine first.Gitmo has guards.  They would not want COVID-19 to spread as it has in other prisons.
107532	This could be like letting a stranger drive you across the country, if that stranger got a driver's license 40 years ago but never drove a car after passing the exam.It's because people won't get vaxxed and take precautions during a global pandemic. Incredible.
201575	"It baffles me every time I hear my peers say ""I don't know what's in the vaccine so I'm not taking it"" My reply-- We've taken well over 7 vaccines since birth without knowing the composition, Covid-19 vaccine isn't any different. Get vaccinated joor!!"
107337	This is why we always remind that Covid-19 is not a joke. For those who loves to go out and dating here and there please wake up. Vaccines or not you will still have the chance to be infected
201639	Got my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine this week, some friends did some pretty awesome things, excited about #MenInKilts, &amp; bought myself some chocolate covered 🍓 &amp; pasta to treat myself today. Time to spread some love &amp; save some lives by donating plasma. #ValentinesDay ❤
105372	@USATODAY Viruses mutate.  That is why they have to tweak the flu vaccine every year.  That is why there is no vaccine for the common cold.  The #coronavirus is a cousin to these.  The Pfizer CEO may know this, that is why he sold Pfizer stock when their vaccine was announced.
106977	THAT is terrific since a vaccine will be useless against what is tantamount to a common cold. The Flu shot is just as useless (it made my husband sick for 6 months).  Save our tax dollars.!.!
106709	#COVID19 #BillGates// I hope you struggle until you're HOMELESS because you deserve it for being so damn DUMB. Even comedian George Carlin would be able to see through this shit but you all probably wouldn't believe him either. All of you all who will take the vaccine, when it
105722	@NTVNewsNL @KellyAnneNTV Yeah I think I will sit this one out for while... You know.. to see what happens to the people who do take a rushed vaccine for a coronavirus where they cut safety and testing measures at every corner...
107090	This is such a stretch but tomorrow, we're gonna see a landslide in covid19 cases.... #Chromatica is the vaccine!!!!!!
106490	And what's abt gujarat ?? They are ruling since 25 years still no announcement of free vaccine. Inspite other states has already announced free vaccine like UP, MP, Jharkhand etc etc. @BJP4Gujarat @BJP4India @CMOGuj @vijayrupanibjp
106150	Devastating news for the doomers who want to stay inside till a vaccine is made. Looks like ya’ll might have to just put your immune systems to work like nature intended 😅 #VaccinesWork

107076	@johnb3112 @PaulBuc31614268 @Pfizer_UK Err, you can get flu after being vaccinated. So no, covid isn't the only one. You need a course on epidemiology as you obviously don't understand. Or even to read up on the basics of vaccines for coronavirus'. 😂😂
106832	This is very important.  It looks like we should be deploying vaccines around the world rather than boosting, for many good reasons
106263	Free testing for the Coronavirus. At my job. Hell no I will never trust a system That find it OK to shoot me but then want to save me with a vaccine. Something is not right here if you can’t protect me legally through bullets and guns are you going to save me with a vaccine
106475	My covid-19 vaccine is booked. I’ve been eligible since March, but I’ve had some trouble getting an appointment. I don’t have the words for the gratitude I feel today. Hang in there everyone, better times are coming. 💛
106702	When it comes to taking that vaccine, I'm in no rush to get it. I have to give it time.The vaccine is not a cure to covid19. There are medication out there which can cure the covid and they are been overlooked. Why is it so?There is something fishy about this vaccine.
106239	So basically we don't have vaccine for virus which is killed by hand sanitizer....Ironic isn't it 😂😂,@COVIDNewsByMIB #COVID__19 #coronavirus
107306	This is a two America’s moment. I would never do any of the things in this video but I’ll take the vaccine tho
106318	Is it too late to join the vaccine race? How far are we into this bubble. Is there still money to be made or is it nearly done? Asking for a friend...
106267	We had the same evaluation in Canada a month or so ago. Canada, I believe, now has 5 vaccines approved, all with 100% efficacy against hospitalization, meaning it reduces the severity of the infection if you do get infected. In 79%, it prevents symptoms completely. Great news.
105374	@CDCgov @FatEmperor I don’t remember getting this advice before I had the flu vaccine. Is it perhaps because the COVID-19 vaccines have been hurried through a typical approval process and they don’t have enough data yet on how effective they truly are.
106759	If some of the countries are out hacking into other countries data to steal a covid19 vaccine, that would mean the stealer does not have a vaccine and if they claim they do, it mustn't work
106198	Notice they specify the words ‘fully vaxed’ so when they are talking about ‘unvaxed’ they are also referring to those who may have only had one shot or failed to get a booster. Hence ‘unvaxed’ is a large pool...
201761	My body my choice &amp;  my choice is no.  It's an unproven, untested vaccine no matter who made it and I'll be goddamned if it's going into my body. You want it go ahead, your body your choice.
106886	Just don’t take one.  Why take a vaccine for a virus that has a .03% death rate and that will only make Bill Gates richer.  THINK PEEPS!
107350	@cosmicdust911 @CatherineLugg @ASlavitt The reason we don’t have a vaccine for colds is because there are so many strains of cold viruses. We do have vaccines against certain coronaviruses already. This is one strain of coronavirus which makes a single vaccine much easier.
107425	I took my headache vaccine this morning.Yesterday I had some allergy vaccine.My wife took her baby vaccine. We’re destroying language. This isn’t a vaccine. #COVID19 #vaccine #Biden @ComicDaveSmith @michaelmalice
201794	@LeoRautins caught your speech with @Paul__Jones and @Eric__Smith on the @FAN590 in my car today and I was applauding you. I had my vaccine on Friday so I am thankful I won’t have to part with my OHIP card #dotherightthing #GetTheShot #covid19
105334	So, just to get this straight:a) international cooperation;b) immigrants, and not just one gender;c) working in a country with free univ tuition= the first COVID vaccine to save lives. #cdnpse
106431	This article is poorly written. There was absolutely no reason to say that they’re the poorest nation (as if that’s their fault???) and if you’re writing an article on how there’s no vaccines then focus on that. Why are you mentioning the other struggles of the country?
201756	I talked to my parents on the phone today. My mom was worried that if there will be a vaccine for COVID-19 then I should not get it because I’ll die or get a “micro chip” under my skin. Also, my mom refuses to wear a mask because it damages the respiratory system.
107196	"@Louise86958858 @KorbelRenoKia @stacyhrae Covid vaccine started being developed after the SARS epidemic (also a firm of Coronavirus) . That's why it seemed ""fast"". They had all the groundwork done over the last 15 years."

201638	This morning after 7 AM got the vaccine, it’s 9:21 PM now and I feel like shit, I had a fairly high temperature and everything hurts. But I'll be fine! 🥴#IGotVaccined #Vaccined #COVID19Vaccine #COVID19 #JohnsonAndJohnson #Poland https://t.co/zZZ5hI8w1J
105505	@tigheklory @stgenerations There are thousands of flu strains, they try to predict a few of out that and end up with 40% or higher success. Not too bad, but CoVid19 is a mutation of the SARS-CoV virus. Very different from the flu virus. The work on this vaccine started with work on SARS-Cov.
107467	@FionaMattatall I actually believe this faith in vaccines is a bit dangerous. Yes, they are important and yes, they will help us get back to some sort of normal life, but they won't eradicate Covid-19 completely and we'll still need to be careful.
106760	2 residents died in my mom's LTC home in the past week. Because workers allowed to choose not to get vaccine- 2 floors on lockdown, no activities, all isolated to rooms. Visits outside over. No way to live  @celliottability @drkieranmoore @fordnation @epdevilla @CBCNews

106677	My son's elementary school is requiring each student to choose between attending in person full-time, or making a commitment to distance learning for the entire school year, even if there's a vaccine in let's say, October!  My concerns are (1) coronavirus (2) education (3) work.
106514	Yeah, and that's why they (i.e. not US, but THEM) are having such a hard time replicating an effective vaccine? --These hominid scientists must be socially incentivized to make highly illogical statements, or are otherwise not properly thinking through the planetwide phenomena.
107149	Why the hell would anyone with common sense buy vaccines from Gates? He’s on trial for horrible crimes against the poor in multiple countries
106689	👉This quick survey is for people working in care homes or social care.Researchers want to know the number of staff getting their flu jabs, which is already thought to be low.Knowing this (and why) could help more staff get their vaccines and reduce pressure from #COVID19.
106696	#Virginia turned blue, now going to make vaccines mandatory! I already had #COVID19 on January in #Florida but my antibody test came back negative, they’re phony, they say it’s 50% wrong, it’s more than faulty, it’s a plot. #SARS2 will fizzle out like #SARS1
107330	I will continue to repeat this: Covid deniers should not be vaccinated until everyone else has received the vaccine, especially hypocrites like Rubio.
106276	I demand a coronavirus vaccine so we can get to the bottom of why @nbc has not made Bye Bye Birdie live with @JLo happen after 4 years.
106700	“What would I do if offered the AZ vaccine? I can't speak for other people, and obviously risk and benefit is something we all have to think about for ourselves, but as a hospital worker in Australia I'm scheduled to get the AZ vaccine some time in the next two months.”
107430	Since you can still get covid and spread it, shouldn't the vaxxed get tested too? #NoVaccineMandates #MyBodyMyChoice
106041	@mickschimp @GovPritzker Vaccines are particularly helpful for herd immunity but they take years to develop. Because COVID-19 is so new there is no herd immunity, because there is no immunity. Being exposed to the virus can be deadly so therefore it is best not to risk it. Period.
105406	@jenrinehart5 To protect our aged mom's health, my brother and I signed up for the Moderna coronavirus vaccine.
105339	@DaniellaCarlisi I get flu shot every year—no problems.  Am hesitant to get COVID-19 shot when it becomes available because it sounds as though Trump is rushing it to market without proper testing.  Wish there were a way to get a Canadian vaccine.  Would drive to border if available to us.
107626	@ChipSerrelli @TexasTribune Lol fuck no. Brandon can kiss my ass with his illegal mandate. Libs acting like the vaccine works just shows how misinformed they areIsrael is on their 4th shot still wondering why they haven’t won yet

106483	There are many people out there can't take the COVID19 VACCINE because of their present health conditions....if they get the COVID19 VIRUS chances are they may not survive.
106259	@RealCandaceO I’m confused. If the right person/group created a vaccine, you wouldn’t take it if Covid-19 kept coming back? Do you get your flu shot? Havent you been critical of anti-vaxers before this? I’m generally curious no disrespect
201754	"Saying ""God will blow in my lungs again"" is just arrogant. A reasonable person of faith would thank the Almighty for the assist, then get the vaccine. #COVID19 #COVIDIOTS"
106725	Yes Selena Gomez is getting the covid-19 vaccine because she saw Britney Spears got it I'm going to keep an eye on her and make sure she is okay it won't even matter if she die because she will be still alive in my fantasies until I die
105558	this is extremely sad but people forget that vaccines protect you only about 95% from getting covid. you can still get covid. but it does give u 100% protection from it being deadly. doesn’t mean you won’t have painful symptoms. just to put it all in perspective.
105988	Can I get my follow-up vaccine in 8 months (or however long it’s gonna be) here plsI also pretended to swim on the floor underneath this while also dealing with a disgustingly swollen ankle/leg covered in rashes (possibly) caused by Lyme Disease in college #Nevur4get
105493	A shockingly high statistic, please RT, blood cancer patients need to know how effective the COVID vaccine is for them
107335	@hdevreij But hwo do they beat they the virus if not with particular antibodies ? @who .. the question is therefore  also vice versa .. People with no flu vaccine beat the flu too #COVID19  #coronavirus
107378	"@prlhrbrscks @BadLegalTakes Knowing this con, probably ""how I invented COVID-19 vaccines and why you shouldn't listen to all the other people claiming they did, and please don't pay attention to my vaccine actually being a partially eaten red crayon"""
106973	@KhamisuArt So let me explain it like this- with vaccines being preventatives, not cures. In other words, the vaccine will protect a person who receives it by lowering their chances of getting COVID-19 if they encounter the coronavirus.
107307	Fear not. Prolly we aint gonna have a choice about whether we get the coronavirus vaccine or not-because we are gonna hafta have an official government vaccine certificate on our phones to enter buildings, fly, shop, drive, have a bank account, buy anything, go out, have a job.
107589	If you think about it if your body can’t make antibodies against Covid-19 once you’ve had it like they say then how is the vaccine 90% effective ? Cos don’t vaccines work by ur body making antibodies to a weakened version of the virus for when you get it properly 🤔
105982	That coronavirus vaccine is definitely going to be a requirement for school districts and colleges/universities. I dont know why this is even a debate when they ALREADY mandate that students have certain shots/vaccines at enrollment.
105448	Still don’t understand why I need a vaccine that has lower efficacy than my own immune system. 99% vs. 94%. Vaccine does not prevent transmission, so what is the purpose?
105791	if the COVID-19 vaccine is available to you why wouldn’t you get it? please explain your reasoning i am really trying to understand
105211	should I get da coronavirus vaccine and spend my weekend feeling like pure shit or should I wait and possibly get the coof
107602	🇨🇦I wonder if a extra faster booster shot is needed after shot 2? All Governments seem to lag behind the science in my opinion. But, there is a problem with having enough for poor countries to even get shot 1. So, this is not good news. 👇
107123	Is china actually capitalist? Well, either way, they don't lock vaccines for massive, civilization paralyzing pandemics, behind patients.
201527	After spending all week eagerly anticipating my 2nd COVID-19 jab this morning, I managed to get absorbed in something I was doing and completely miss my appointment.Thank you to Darwin Practice for following with a phone call too remind me and being flexible with the time.
106234	@elzi0n engineering the body to produce coronavirus spike proteins like a Frankenstein mutation. To magically coerce anti-bodies when anti-bodies provided no such protection before, and will only reduce symptoms. based on faulty PCR. Is not a vaccine. It's fraud.
106345	Because most of y'all won't get the vaccine, #COVID19 is going to hang around like herpes. India WISH they had as much vaccine and open appointments as us.Listen, the vaccine isn't killing folks. #Covid_19 STILL is.
106214	need i remind you that coronavirus HAS been around and they’ve been developing a vaccine for years now. this is just a different strand, so no they didn’t pull a vaccine out of thin air in 6 months.
107570	I don’t understand either. It is a mystery. I am fully vaccinated with booster and so are my three young kids. I was so relieved when they were eligible to get the vaccine. Why wouldn’t I do something to help mitigate the risk of them getting sick? That’s how I see it…🤷‍♀️
107474	@Warnzwifey @SimonYstwyth @Louiseg37789012 @simondolan A successful vaccine is perhaps 70% effective, a poor one 30%.We’ve been trying for 40 years for a coronavirus vaccine &amp; failed, there is not one. How effective do you supposed the rushed, untested &amp; very expensive mandated one will be??If you think 50% you’re deluded.
107562	In 24 hours I will receive my first COVID19 vaccine and I am overwhelmingly relieved.Being immunocompromised and living through a pandemic has been a special kind of bad, but hopefully this is the beginning of the end🙌🏼
105897	It's crazy how sm people so willing to criticize people for not putting a vaccine in their body when the vaccine is still in emergency usage, is pushed by the Gov w a pedophile as the spokes person (bill gates) and it doesnt even fuckin work effectively? People still die
106676	@marco001100 @RedDogT3 LOL. Do you know from where the vaccinated people are getting COVID? Ding Ding Ding, they are getting it from unvaccinated people. If all unvaccinated get the vaccine, vaccinated won't get an infection because there is no unvaccinated to spread COVID19 to the vaccinated
106551	Two ryerson students have coronavirus looooool u will not catch me leaving my house until they have a vaccine
106074	#USArmy know truth about covid19 vaccine,They are smart one and refuse ,We Indian are 🐑 get in line to take those genetically modified virus in there healthy body.
201776	@Tawakkalna_care I have received my 1st  dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 04 April 2021 Oxford AstraZeneca  and received  2nd dose on 13/07/2021 Pfizer-BioNtech. Please do the necessary corrections. Thanks Sher Ali Khan Sher Iqama# 2247638964
106633	How can a vaccine made so quickly be both safe and effective?? Show me the proof before I sign my family up. #TrumpsAmerica #TrumpIsKillingAmericans #BidenHarris2020 if you want a President who’s competent and practical.

106305	@Arethusa99 @CT_Bergstrom @loisbeckett @CNBC @WHO I'm afraid the genie that isn't going to go back in the bottle, after the protests, is the #COVID19 restrictions. There's not even any point in advocating restrictions now.  It will just invite resistance to doing things like wearing masks and taking vaccines.
105563	@rabid_rabitt @nathandfletcher @DPJHodges And when will they be ready because we were told they would be ready to roll out by October and that's tomorrow. No coronavirus vaccine currently exists, only 1 disease has ever been eradicated by vaccine and that took 184 years to achieve. There is no magic bullet coming.
107249	@guardian What happened to FLATTENING THE CURVE? You can’t eradicate a virus. Furthermore there has never been a vaccine for ANY coronavirus - Aka Flu, SARS, Mers-COV. I smell propaganda.
106100	@jsolomonReports @justonepatriot Fauci has a financial stake in a vaccine for coronavirus.  If a cheap alternative can knock this out Fauci would not only lose financially but he would lose his liberal rock star status and miss out on the opportunity to go on tv and and give his fase predictions.
106051	We Humans are the virus and Corona is a vaccine to this world. Indeed! The killing of the innocent elephant in Malappuram deserves equal global attention as that of George Flyods'. Rest in☮️ 🙏 #animalcruelty #saveelephant #Malappuram #GeorgeFlyods #virus #coronavirus #COVIDー19

106296	@kmelo32 How long does wearing a mask last? Coronavirus is one of the most common viruses there is. This virus will mutate at around nine month intervals drastically. Vaccines will be as useful as vaccines for the flu just a best guess. We all need to start thinking for ourselves
107399	@TosinAshafa It's really scary tbh but then all we can do is wait till a vaccine is out or we might possibly not have one, treatment would be the only curable option for Covid-19 in the long run
106314	@jasonsphipps I think they will be lifted when our hospitalizations are very low from COVID-19 (right now on par with influenza but understandably US probably wants even lower severe disease which can be accomplished with vaccines).
106653	So, #COVID19 is solved, NoKo response settled, economy good, ISIS gone, middle East Peace, no kids in cages, vaccine has been successful!If none of that is true,WHY THE FUCK IS THE IMPOSTER @POTUS RAGE TWEETING ABOUT STUPID SHIT, HIMSELF.This #fuckingmoron will not shut up.
107400	"@ABC Why bother waiting when the ""vaccine"" does NOT stop #COVID19 ?And by not testing the vaccinated our government is just allowing a huge potentially contaminated population to just run free...while blaming the minority of the population."
106112	@awearbo @honeybe02577966 @raissawriter What i meant is that the Opposition should not become like Persida Acosta in her vaccine scare-mongering.  Do not politicize the Covid19 vaccine
107398	Running implicitly thru the nytimes piece on the Oxford covid-19 vaccine work is the fact capital refuses to fund research or vaccine development to save millions of lives unless it sees profit in it. This fact is acknowledged in a buried paragraph but critical for understanding
106522	@rumpolekid Don't worry that's the white cells fighting the flu germ. If you want to have it worse take the coronavirus vaccine.
106329	If you are so much genius and developed in any sector #China country than make this #Coronavirus vaccine and share to all world's countries where there is need.
106379	This is complete insanity. It is terrible knowing that this is happening right Next door. 🇨🇦 This is coming to America if we do not stop it.#NoVaccineMandates #NoVaccinePassportsAnywhere #DoNotComply
107215	@littledeekay Yeah… while it WOULD be a good idea to try to get true facts out on large platforms Re: coronavirus vaccine, I’m still saddened that we’re even at the point where this is a thing.
105352	I’m confused. If #vaccines work why #masks?  Whose at risk? Me -no mask and no vaccine or you with vaccine?  Either they work or not. Stop the illogical games. #covid19 #WakeUpAmerica #mindgame

The vaccine, coincidentally approved JUST BEFORE the outbreak of covid19, would theoretically work for SARS-COV2 because their RNA are not so much different.  It’s not like the flu.
105357	Essentially the #COVID19 vaccine is socialized medicine that republican politicians are clawing over their continuants to get first after saying that the virus was only the flu with a low death rate. #GOP #coronavirus #COVID19Vaccine #SundayMorning #SundayThoughts
105649	Am sure in the covid-19 researchers’ labs they are talking about finding someone that is immune to the virus in order to make the vaccine and it’s like some African guy in like central Africa
107015	Without adequate vaccine cover when SOPs are relaxed there will be an another wave, “V” shaped recovery is for countries that ensure adequate vaccine coverage. For countries like us it is “W” a shaped recovery.
107408	The bad news: The vaccine didn't work.The good news: You'll be able to fight the virus better next time if you aren't dead because the vaccine didn't work.
107651	When GOP MAGA chosen god and so-called president said that the Coronavirus was a hoax; not so serious, why are they pushing their vaccine? Profits anyone?
106154	We've never had successful FLU vaccine, nor for AIDS, so how in a few short months are we going to get anything safe for a cartoon virus?
201780	I’m super excited for tomorrow morning. I am getting microchipped by #BillGates!Kidding! I am finally able to get my first #COVID19 vaccine. Thank you to doctors, nurses, epidemiologists, every person in the healthcare system for your tireless work❤️#VaccinesSaveLives
107524	Why ALWAYS AFRICA??? We have the lowest cases in the world but yet we are the only place to test this vaccine. More evidence of how invaluable African lives are to these FIRST world countries. Our leaders need to do better to protect us. #GETOUTOFAFRICA #AfricanLivesMatter
201702	Received my covid-19 booster shot today. Feeling a little safer. If you haven't yet received the vaccine, please don't wait. Your life is on the line. #VaccinesSaveLives
105601	"@Ismaarl @fathuns @vichalhey @M_SalmaFikry @WHO @HPA_MV When we say vaccine for Covid19 people think it will protect one from a #Covid19. But it as for now ""MAY"" or ""MAY NOT"""
106116	London doesn't know how many residents it has. People move in and out and don't always bother to update GPs. Probably accounts for London's comparatively low vaccine stats and infection stats. So they are sending out letters to -people who aren't here.
201543	Very grateful because @lfmexi and I have just received our first dose of covid-19 vaccine #AstraZeneca 🙏Reminder: (almost) complete protection comes after the second dose.#GetVaccinated
106638	@Reuters The single information guide is obviously wrong, and it will make you misunderstand. It is correct to understand the conditions for manufacturing coronavirus, and the vaccine used in China is an inactivated virus vaccine, not mRNA. There is no technical condition.🙏
107277	I don't see this playing out well for the @NFL and the @NFLPA They practically forced their players to get vaccinated so they could play this season and here we are with guys testing positive left and right. Wonder how players will feel about getting jabbed and still can't play
106489	We’re in 58th place in the world, Gerry, behind Borat’s Kazakhstan, for percentage fully vaccinated. That’s how I am measuring success. My mother being in the hospital for a month with Covid, but fortunately not dying, is a success but it had nothing to do with securing vaccines
105533	@KyleThinksTwice @BrennanGeis @Dean_Winnipeg @PierrePoilievre They work far better than no vaccine. Another 50 people died in Ontario today from #COVID19 and ICU admissions are up above 600. This is because most do not have a booster. If you want to get sick great, but don’t try to use your rights as a way to take my rights away.
105965	@DrTomFrieden How about Inate or crossimmunity. Like how cowpox cured smallpox and vaccinia is used in the smallpox vaccine. Three different strains of pox virus. So other coronavirus exposure could provide cross immunity to the covid one.
105880	Would be interesting to know what the usual vote is for vaccines. I think it is important to know what the concerns were for the no/abstains
201683	Now really debating to really call my dentist office sometimes this week before my second COVID-19 vaccine next week since my toothache is not getting any better and it is starting to really bother me. Now I am not going to be surprised if I do have a cavity and my sealants worn.
107312	Waves are unpredictable. We will know that wave has arrived when it actually hits us. Just take out vaccines from hospitals to roads and mohallas. Jo apne ikhtiyar mein hai vo to karo
106717	@htTweets Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
106058	If you've ever ride the U8, you do not need to worry about what is in the vaccine #berliner #subway #coronavirus
106975	I will never understand why people want the COVID-19 vaccine. &amp; why people openly brag about getting it, like they’ve achieved something special lol. This “virus” has a 99.96% survival rate. Before COVID did you all sit and brag about flu/whooping cough and other vaccinations? No
105220	@borderman67 @FurburgerMayor Agreed but it's not a true vaccine.BTW I'm not an #antivaxxer I've had my first one and I've had Covid19.
106764	For the Record I'm having my Jab asap because i'm in Group 6. My folks were in Group 4. Do I think you should 'have to have' #COVID19 jab if you're 25, Female, No comorbidity then God no! Some scientists r against healthy getting vaccinated. Can we have debate about it at least?
106342	@Polkameister I could see saying until COVID-19 has a vaccine loosening this as yes some will abuse it but we want to ensure anyone sick isn't coming to work to avoid spread, but making this permanent is nuts.  I think 5 sick days and anything beyond requires a doctor's note.
106743	@RichieRTR @conorsen Also, the reason why the flu vaccine is 46% effective is not really relevant here. Flu vx is partially a guesswork game about which new mutations will be prevalent in the coming year. That is not the case with covid-19 as it has very little evolutionary pressure.
106528	@ABC Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
105434	@JoeBiden Pastor Hoa Thai Nguyen Sr and wife will not get the CovidVaccine. He said Jesus Christ will protect him. Tom Adsit Trang Adsit and Leann Adsit will not get the CovidVaccine because they believe the Coronavirus will not infect nor affect their his family. Can you make them get it?

105662	@marklevinshow I'm confused. Isn't COVID-19 a hoax? Why go to all this trouble to develop a vaccine, besides selling it as snake oil and getting filthy rich?
105987	If he rushes the vaccine and it is later proven to be ineffective, or worse, more people may die. There is a scientific method in place for a reason. Just hope scientists remain steadfast in their ethics and integrity.

105878	@RobbieTheFire There are over 60 strains of coronavirus that are mutating always. A vaccine is good for one strain, until it mutates. A vax is not 100% immunity. By the way where did all the flu cases go?

107274	Of course China is their model. They need an economic collapse to implement the agenda.#COVID19 is already in Africa but e.g. Senegal are using #Hydroxychloroquine (from malaria stockpiles) so it's not a problem. Bill Gates just wants to test his vaccines there.

106572	@KMPHFOX26 Well we'll see about this I'm holding my breath we have not had any one in my immediate family catch the delta or the original covid-19 we're all vaccinated boostered up I'm just wondering if we're going to escape this time around too
107006	I got my first shot of covid-19 vaccine this morning. So far still good, there's nothing to be worry, except now I'm feeling sleepy &amp; hungry 😁
201698	I never got a flu vaccine until I realized how much safer it was for my grandparents, my father-in-law, and babies in my circle. Yes, I might only be a carrier, but they could have severe symptoms and even die. Covid is the same. Minnesotans look out for each other. #VaccinesWork
105661	If the PCR tests work-Why the false positives?If the masks work-Why the 6 feet?If 6 feet works-Why the masks?If all three work-Why the lockdowns?If all four work-Why the vaccine?If the vaccine is safe-Why the no liability clause?If Covid-19 exists- it not been isolated?
106488	@SurvivalGirl1 @NYCAIeks @NYGovCuomo Considering that I already stated  that the Coronavirus  strain is known as COVID-19, I am not suprised.When they formulate this vaccine  it will save myriad lives  because people's bodies will be able to develop antibodies as a prophylactic measure to make them resistant.  😁👍
107075	@sunethagampodi Hope you clearly know that this is false as a doctor.Almost all the child deaths were in unfortunate kids with chronic illnesses who had low immunity anyway.On the other hand unlike MMR vaccine, COVID-19 vaccines don't prevent infections, it only has a minor mortality benefit.
201503	Got my second COVID-19 vaccine earlier today, outside of a faint headache and a dull pain in my shoulder I'm feeling pretty okay so far. Will have to wait two more days for any side effects to come out, just hoping it'll go as smooth as my first vaccination did. https://t.co/XFehNH97HZ
106607	@GOPLeader Trump didn’t take responsibility for the spread of COVID-19 so he doesn't now get to take credit for a vaccine.
106316	So medics in a snowstorm can administer the vaccine to stranded motorists so not to waste it but a Dr. can't 😡 RIDICULOUS!' #vaccine #coronavirus
107201	@Armandozim @ToddCoo72170990 @LinaHidalgoTX Well actually the other end is not working.... Why do you think cdc is no longer tracking breakthrough covid-19 cases they don't want you to know the truth vaccine are not working
106518	So I’ve been offered a job as a care assistant (my third dream job 🥲) but also they’ve said that they can’t promise me that I don’t lose that job in the future if I don’t get the vaccine. 😓 I totally understand that and thanked them for the offer. Goodbye my dream job. #COVID19
105913	So my girlfriend got her #COVID19 vaccine #ShotNo1 she's kinda felt #FluLike for a couple days. I just have a headache and my arm is sore lol
107179	Family being sick is always sad. This girl doesn't believe in vaccines but will take mother with kidney cancer to hospital to get chemo therapy? I doubt this family would be pleased to be taken to a hospital where doctors #DoNotComply and let anyone go up and down and do whatever
106848	Here’s a contrast. Yesterday, spoke with someone in Arizona “reluctant” to get her #COVID19 vaccine. Why? Conspiracy theories. Today, a friend in #India who desperately wants a vaccine for her son said they can’t get it. We don’t realize how privileged we are in the US. Shameful.
105840	JUST IN - U.S. Army: Soldiers who refuse to get a COVID-19 vaccine will be immediately discharged, Reuters reports.
105403	I signed up for initial vaccine testing (wasn't chosen), but this is a responsible position. #ncpol #NCSenateDebate #ncsen
107508	Aren’t republicans needing help to feed their families? Don’t they want to receive the vaccine? Aren’t they Americans? So sad they are divided.
106258	No way!. Research the vaccines. Amazing how bad it is. Why take it? I don't trust government information!
107549	Even finding a covid-19 vaccine won’t be enough to end the pandemicLimited supplies could create coronavirus haves and have-nots around the globe once a vaccine is manufactured
107501	This is really just a “fuck you” to the disabled and immune compromised ppl like myself…I have my vaccine, I have my booster and I’m abt to get another…but without a plan in place getting COVID-19 is fatal for me and for many others.
106997	For those wondering.....YES! I’m going to get the COVID-19 Vaccine whenever it’s my turn or time to do it. I WANT MY LIFE BACK!
105591	my dad is leading the research and development on a coronavirus vaccine and i just sat on a bong water wet spot on my computer chair and had a panic attack
106864	@PoliticsForAlI If @UKLabour oppose vaccine passports and they fail to get through parliament, and if they begin to actually oppose the Coronavirus legislation then I think many of us might even consider voting for them again, having ditched them years ago. @EssexPR?You reading, @Keir_Starmer?
106703	Trump's latest is to say every American will get coronavirus vaccine by April. Trump the scientist? Trump the drug manufacturer? We can't get enough paper towels or onion powder in our grocery stores! Flu vaccines run out every year even though the population no. is known.
106026	I want details-I have RA, I take methotrexate, and I’m still an ICU RN. But does this make sense without antibody testing, with unvaxxed coworkers, and so many places in the world without enough vaccines? Like I don’t even know what is fair or right.
107142	@crbarnes001 If someone's has had the so-called vaccine they will probably get a positive test result. But you will never really know the truth as to if she had a virus or not because post-mortem and coroners have been banned for anyone registered as a covid-19 death.
105571	So glad they accept the Docket App for the vaccine proof. Easy to use and has all the information needed
107672	@MinistryofTru16 @LibertyTre3 @TheFutureLover @McAuleyATL @kenklippenstein @EconCircus @KilldozerSZN Is the US not also producing the largest opioid crisis in history? Meanwhile the UK has provided key research for the coronavirus vaccine. Both are good systems, but to say the US is currently superior because of pure output isn’t something I agree with.
106453	What an idiot  this guy @prageru @DennisPrager . Where would we be in this country if horrible people like Prager had obstructed polio vaccine like they do #COVID ? Dead. Or crippled . That’s where
106161	"I listened, but I still can't actually believe what I heard..!The MINISTER FOR HEALTH says it's called ""COVID-19"" because there were 18 other coronaviruses before this one?And developing a vaccine will be difficult because they weren't successful with any of the previous 18?🙊"
106888	How is it possible that healthy people must be forced to isolate, not work, then not get paid cus they have come into contact with a likely vaccinated, testing, app loving , mask wearing person who can still pass it on and should be safe cus they are jabbed?
106119	@yevandy_ So scary. I'm just waiting for what people like them will say when the vaccine for COVID-19 comes out. It will be crazy 😂😂😂
201790	I'm so excited and relieved, I just booked my covid19 booster shot!!! Funny, it's EXACTLY 6 months to the day!!!
106136	Very stressful fews days helping to order in and set up the track and trace process for the Covid vaccine. Happy to see patients start to receive the vaccine, and proud to play a part in the first person in the world to receive it.
106443	@Lesliiiemarie so the “vaccine” is made then what? i never took a flu shot before. so it’ll be mandatory for everyone in the united states of america possibly the world to take the covid19 vaccine to be safe. ever wondered how many deaths a day from the flu?
107650	Kill me now. Waiting for a vaccine is pure idiocy and has zero scientific basis. There has never been a vaccine for a coronavirus, and it would be at best 30% effective, like a flu vaccine. It's a mutating virus. It's completely insane.
106282	@sunnydayrealaf @JamesonHook @KyleKulinski Actually, it’s something to do funds for a vaccine is why there is delay but with Covid-19 it’s impacted nearly everyone and the rich were or are losing money without workers to do their work. Funds has become available for Covid-19 because the economy was tanking
107468	This is why they are protesting,Why everyone else is not being denied American Covid-19 Vaccines &amp; these ppl in need, 90 miles away from Florida are not getting any aid?Wow...
107404	@subluxt @GeniusesqAx @Boy2020Patriot @CNN highly transmissible omicron variant — which has demonstrated an ability to evade coronavirus vaccines, leading to a surge in breakthrough infections so basically the vaccine is overblown?
105994	Coronavirus is FAKE NEWS because the government is pretending people are sick because they want to give everyone a vaccine that makes you sick because something something 5G Bill Gates another double vodka please Davy now that brings me to microchips...
105753	@252ALLMZ @deelightfulEP @Cleavon_MD @alaskarebel If you legitimately care to understand how the mRNA covid-19 vaccine safely works to build immunity without a killed virus, I’m happy to take the time to explain it all.  If you’re just an AV peddler of known lies, I hope no one ignorant to science or basic facts is exposed 2u.
105349	I love how this guy apparently has a knob somewhere he can just turn whenever he wants to give out more vaccine.If this number is so easily adjustable, cut the bullshit &amp; just send it all.A news article announcing the increase makes you look a like a douche who's holding out.
105202	W T F???  Lol.  Why would anyone want a vaccine with a 99.7% survival rate?  Not to mention you get a vaccine and still must follow the draconian, nonsensical mask nonsense.🙄.  Yeah I’ll pass.
105476	YET AGAIN!!!! Force us home &amp; require everyone that isn’t allergic to the vaccine to get it before they can work. Cause this is just stupid.
106747	A 90% effective vaccine that will deal with 20 or so mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (which causes the COVID-19 disease) is coming.  If offered, will you take it?
105618	@kman_blac @TheTNHoller @tnhousegop This is a novel coronavirus. Meaning they’ve never seen a virus like it before. Science takes time. The polio vaccine took decades to get right. It is a series of 4 shots giving to infants. We are at three shots now, 4 in Israel. It’s proven to save lives. Why fight it? #Science
106949	@DonnellyStephen On Pat Kenny talking about a vaccine passport? How come we don’t need one for measles? If you’re vaccinated surely it doesn’t matter then if I am? You’re an idiot! #COVID19 #CovidVaccine #lockdown2021
105286	Here’s one for any virologists/immunologists out there: if this Indian #Covid variant can partially evade antibodies of vaccinated people, will this not be an immediate catalyst for mutations which make it *completely* immune to the vaccines? How does this ever end?#COVID19
105521	@ANI So if I take the vaccine and something happens to me, then my family can't even sue the company I took vaccine of. Well then find a proper cure then only I will be taking it.@pmo @aajtak @AJEnglish @dwnews @ndtv #covid19
107647	@KAMRLocal4News Now they want help financially when the COVID-19 vaccine is free????? SMFH don't feel sorry for these people
107155	So I’m ngl my #NHSCovidVaccine has knocked me out today, woke up with possibly every side effect and felt awful, I’m drained and still don’t feel 100% but it’s all going to be worth it. So definitely go get your vaccine when you can! #CovidVaccine #COVID19
106667	"The first bill after a ""free"" vaccine Vaccine: Free! (:Talking to the receptionist: $300Nurse discussing procedure: $700Medical grade needle: $400Doctor shows up for 2 mins: $1000"
105256	"@jtodd8200 @HaimishTheRed @agalligani @Jim_Jordan People immigrating to the US have to have a COVID-19 vaccine as of Oct 1st of this year when they get their medical eval. If they don't have the vaccine then they don't get their medical evaluation completed, and their immigration process can't continue. That's the ""how""."
107607	@InteriorsAvenue @Kat_La @vinthropologist What do you call someone that is not against taking the MMR vaccine but not COVID-19 jab? Are they an antivaxxer? Or someone that has taken all vaccines that is against mandatory vaccination? Are they an antivaxxer?
107105	@DebtandCupcakes My understanding is that the specific virus that causes the common cold has enough mutation every year that we have to “re learn” how to fight itFlu vacc. are a “guess” on which strain is most commonI believe COVID-19 is unique enough and low mutation that vaccine would work
106574	My mom just received her first #COVID19Vaccine! The process was so fast and efficient, and everyone has been amazing. Thank you @ROWPublicHealth! #COVID19 #grateful #wrawesome
201679	So, I got my second dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine a bit under 24 hours ago. Feeling fatigued; weak in the limbs and joints. No fever (yet). Otherwise, nothing too serious.Please go get yours asap if you are eligible.
105221	**Genuinely Curious** If someone had caught #COVID19 &amp; had minor symptoms but their body built/grew antibodies to fight the virus why would they still need the Vaccine?
105831	@seanhannity @RandPaul They don't want to shut down covid19 they want to push there vaccine thats killing people plus there's an election coming up so they have a chance to cheat
105347	@Belly_sleeazy Besides me I don't think I've met a younger person who's taking the covid-19 vaccine 💉
105206	@dkdmac ‘Myth: The COVID-19 vaccines don't work because you can still get COVID after vaccination.Fact: COVID-19 vaccination will protect most people from getting sick with COVID-19, ranging from 66% to 100% effective.’I think it’s clear that is not true. Everyone is still getting it.
105415	This world have went to hell since the coronavirus and the COVID-19 vaccine came here all of this is drawling people from the Lord and people don’t want to go church now because of it we need to be in church in this time what this world is going through we need to pray for world
105647	Some people think this coronavirus is a scar tactic... thinking that the vaccine was made back in 2017 or something but they seem to forget it’s a different strain...... meaning that the vaccine wouldn’t work.........
105371	@superdupergrump @MollyJongFast Fwiw I'm not some anti vaxxer. I get all my Dr reccd vaccines. How CV19 evolves is an unknown at this point. It could very well end up being like other coronavirus that aren't so much as deadly, as they are just an annual nuisance.
106271	@HelenBranswell @mariojoze EPIC is a problematic format 4 vaccine information, since EPIC was 1st developed as a billing system. QR codes are an elitist tool - many hv no smartphones. Better example is California's Blue Shield and Kaiser Permanente partnership in the CA COVID-19 vaccine rollout this year.
106036	Nice this is going to be @JoeBiden, Rioting and Looting with no recourse, send the vaccine to Iran and China before we give it to our own vulnerable people.  @joeb is a National Disgrace #BidenCrimeFamilyExposed #BidenCrimeFamily
105551	Vaccine maniacs say, well you took medicine for cancer so why don’t you just take the vaccine? I did due diligence on specific treatments and my doctors gave me the choice, never a mandate. I chose integrative treatments, natural and pharma, but it was my choice. #COVID19
105910	Uh Adam troll - fortunately I have not yet contracted Covid but I am confident that should I the vaccine will keep me from having serious symptoms #mepolitics so very brave you are
107595	me in 2015: omg need to get up at 9 to get tickets for this festival with my mates                                                         me in 2021: omg I need to get up at 5am to book in for my coronavirus omnicrom variant booster shot
201506	Today I got vaccinated witb first dose of #COVID19 #vaccine #Covishield ! I am fully stable and urge all of you to please go and get vaccinated as soon as you can!! Vaccination krayega india tbi toh corona ko hrayega india! ✌
105317	"#Auspol #MSM talk is unsurprising-ie,that it will undermine ""#vaccine confidence."" Are these people imbeciles? OF COURSE,using any part of the #AIDS #virus in any #vaccines will undermine confidence! Do ""#scientists need a #PR person to tell them that? #COVID19 #coronavirus"
105946	Wether people want to acknowledge it or not EVERYONE who has taken the jab is enrolled in the vaccine trials. EUA is not the same as an FDA approved. This is sad and never should have happened
105399	That's great, and I'm not paranoid, but all a video would show is a president being stuck with a needle. Could be saline. I will still get the vaccine when I'm allowed, I'm just saying....
107563	Dogs have had a vaccine against coronavirus for years .I  don't understand why the  Health Officials don'come up with  o ne for humans. Also, any dogbreeder could have to told them  that  it's extremely contagious even w no symptoms present. I ccm really disappointed in  govt ppl
201727	Today is the 1st anniversary of Covid19, On this day the first ever Covid19 case was recorded in Wuhan #CovidVaccine
107542	@strakovka @ZdravkoOnline @PArenberger @AndrejBabis Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
105217	Seriously everyone research what’s exactly in these so called vaccines that gates donated so much money to get off and running and to vaccinate the whole world hmmm
105919	@RN1814 @SchmittNYC Wow you still hiding under your bed. You do realize there will never be a vaccine for this Coronavirus it’s always mutating, that’s the nature of the Coronavirus. The common cold is a Coronavirus, no vaccine. So Enjoy eternity in your home.
201771	Received my second #COVID19 vaccine this morning. Arm less sore than the first and no other symptoms. The significance of this moment is not lost on me. Hoping we can make the vaccine more accessible to the public in the coming weeks! #PfizerCovidVaccine https://t.co/A1gs6HlnI9
107323	"“my advice to anyone offered the vaccine is to take it - if I can have it at 90 then you can have it too."""
105478	"I have an appt to get the vaccine soon 🙏 and I've also become a ""masks for life"" person. I ❤️ not spreading/getting illness + I don't just mean COVID. No cold or flu? That's rad, too. Plus, I haven't had a single stranger tell me to smile for a whole year now. Big mask fan 😷"
107281	They should first prove to us that this vaccine is actually going to be a vaccine.&amp;that it will be to help reduce the symptoms of Covid19. If they are able to prove these two points,then people should take it.Yet just an experiment with vaccine is likely to yield few good results
106030	I don't understand why this is being promoted.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  This is not optics.  It's not strategic. It's not even coherent given the spotligbt on HQ and UV light therapy.#novaccines
106559	That's great for the US but no way Trump lets the rest of the world get any if they find the vaccine.
105445	I feel like it ought be stated up front that the person whom died was in the control group and did not recieve the vaccine.
106989	Here we go! So now every soulless dipshit will be dumping their pets in the streets or killing them. The C in pet vaccines (like DHLPP-C vax) is corona. Corona has existed FOREVER... it is the COMMON COLD. These MSM Morons are trying to create fear. DO NOT DUMP YOUR PETS! (con't)
106216	What’s wrong with this country? Are Gbajabiamila and all the people pushing that bill to pass going to line up and take the Coronavirus vaccine first? Even if they gave them money? How can they be pushing through a bill that will endanger their lives? #StoptheNCDCBill
105465	@QuintonLucasKC Why are people even discussing this. The common cold is a coronavirus and there has never been a successful vaccine or cure or even treatment for it. Covid-19 is a much more complex cv so it will not happen. Accept it. And if they do get one the virus will mutate making it void
107438	Whatsapp broadcast message dem bout fi turn right up... Might can get my vaccine fast tracked  when the conspiracy theorist dem come out heavy
106751	Here’s why Bill Gates wants indemnity… Are you willing to take the risk?Why are the world's top vaccine promoters, like Paul Offit and Peter Hotez, frantically warning us about the unique and frightening dangers inherent in developing a coronavirus vaccine?�
105500	One question to all: Do you think that current lockdown will be continued further after 21 days?!?🤔P.S. I am not asking if it should be or shouldn’t be, just, if it will be or not?!?😓#vaccines #SundayThoughts #lockdown #Stayhomestaysafe #CoronavirusPandemic #9बजे9मिनट
105869	This is exactly why anything .@ScottMorrisonMP and .@GregHuntMP say is just noise until there is an ACTUAL vaccine. #ScottyFromMarketing #LiarFromTheShire #COVID19Vic #COVID19Aus
106765	“And as with the other vaccines, scientists don't yet know if it stops people catching Covid”In essence , rolling out vaccines is still like running clinical trials .
106445	I have doubts regarding #Covid19 #vaccine #vaccination process in #India. 👇1)Is, it necessary for everyone to inject. If someone doesn't want?2)If anyone is already suffering from another disease?3)Side effects?4)How safe? #coronavirus #COVID20 #Doctor #doctors #delhi
106748	@bujaboy19 @vandy_007 5G and Coronavirus it is a game plan to implement vaccine..to God be the glory, their didnt work out
106340	Got my covid-19 vaccine today. Got some arm pain. Just like I get with the flu vaccine.  Ni side effects.  I hope if you are eligible now to take please please do.  #CovidVaccine
106728	@g Same people will refuse to get a Covid-19 vaccine once it is developed and will contract the disease, spread it around and mor people will die needlessly.
105518	"*Russia has developed 'first' coronavirus vaccine: Putin*MOSCOW: Russia has developed the first vaccine offering ""sustainable immunity"" against the coronavirus, President Vladimir Putin announced Tuesday."
107485	Are you a soldier or a deserter?We should be 'soldiers' in the war against #COVID19.I'll take the #vaccine when my time comes, even though it might kill me.Either I die or I become #immune; both outcomes keep me from spreading the #virus to my community. #soldieron
105629	ok idk anything about this but why is CV19 research not just open source? wouldn't we be finding a vaccine quicker and then be able to manufacture it quicker?
105622	Many unknowns with one constant: Herd Immunity seems to be the only answer against the #PandemicCovid19, but how we achieve it differs. Vaccine or enough people get infected.
105907	Bottom line...until they come out with a vaccine for COVID19 and it's free, I'm most likely not going back to any kind of regular job dealing with the public. Certain controlled circumstances with trusted people, maybe. But the job world is fucked up right now.
105867	He tested negative and still has to sit. It's an insanely dumb rule. But, getting the vaccine isn't a big deal and he could have avoided these stupid rules but decided to risk it.
105475	@Noahpinion @NoahCRothman IIRC Chinavax was made with A coronavirus, not THE covid-19 because they were trying to beat everyone to market for prestige.They did. But it's not a covid vaccine and it doesn't protect like one.
105733	@ohiojennie @Idunnowhat6 @CNN There is no deadly virus. It has been a hoax all along. I had my account suspended, yesterday so, I lost all my video evidence. Copy and Paste this into Bitchute's search box and watch this video:  MATTEO ARENA ITALIAN MEDICAL DOCTOR WARNING AGAINST COVID-19 TEST AND VACCINE
106733	@DraftTulsi Thats my problem honestly it was made too fast. What will happen when another new coronavirus comes. Will they say the same vaccine is gonna work?
105547	Lockdown Will not stop the spread It will only slowdown the spread The only way to stop the covid19 is to made a vaccine @narendramodi
107319	@freep How could it possibly be a ‘reopening’ WITHOUT a 'coherent national' coronavirus plan in the US to get the virus under control and keep it that way!! Like a VACCINE!!! HOW?? 🤷🏽‍♂️

105301	But go ahead and inject yourself with the fucktard vaccine, the same virus you twits are afraid of! If immunity wears off, they’re going to try to scam you like the flu shot. Repeatedly injecting poison. #WakeUpPeople
107287	Giving vaccines to everyone is good idea but what about testing everyone?What is World's Best CM waiting for to Test every 11.40 Cr Population of Maharashtra?Why no one wants to test everyone but hell bent on giving vaccines before testing?
106618	no one wants this vaccine... especially those who are not sick, ('asymptomatic'='not sick')... stupid as hell to inject disease into your body... but ya'll are pushin' worse than drug dealers... tryin' to make folks think they want this... death... a crime against humanity (:~:)
106184	I know everyone is a bit nervous about getting the COVID-19 vaccine. I got mine today at 1026. I did it for my mom, my family, my friends, and my patients. I was a bit sentimental and cried because of those patients we lost despite everything we did. This was especially for them.
106481	when/if they come out with a covid-19 vaccine, will you be getting it or are you skeptical about the motives/agenda and decline the vaccine? 🤔
106948	You think they will tell you if the vaccine is safe for you before you take it? What about me? Better yet what about my kids? Will they be forced to take something made to kill them? You think something is wrong with me now let something happen to one of my kids. Life changing.
105627	I just got another nutty email about my column from Friday.  One of his crazy conspiracy theories is that Bill Gates refused the Covid vaccine because he's in the know and feels it's too dangerous.I don't have the heart to send this back to the person.
105673	@JamesDesmond99 @KerryAnnSmith1 As I keep pluggingCovid19 has no loyalty to any Political Party or Person.It only understands the Absolute state of the art, latest most science driven solutions until a workable safe vaccine arrives.Period.
201640	@FrancyDias9 ✋you bet i am wearing one in public. Plus vaccinated and a booster.  My sister died of covid19 before the vac. Came to the west coast.
105889	@leenorman54 The CMO said it is inevitable that everyone will get coronavirus over the next few years, just like the common cold that goes around and around. A vaccine may stop it, but that's a way off.
105381	So covid-19 antibodies may sometimes also respond to human proteins, causing autoimmune issues. The vaccines use the same protein to trigger the immune response, so may cause similar responses. This possibility is supported by an increased incidence of anaphylaxis
106670	@WhiteHouse @DeborahBirx How far away is a vaccine? Or information on why COVID-19 mutates so fast? Or what can slow it down once it enters lungs
201798	First it was take any shot you can get…so I took AZ….then it evolved to take any shot you can get but not AZ so I took Moderna….by the time I get to the booster will they be flat out giving only Pfizer?
106094	So Today, Moderna is leading the pack to develop a new vaccine for the SARS-coronavirus?  I guess it helps if you've been working on it a year before it happened.Such geniuses at Moderna!! How could they possibly know a SARS-coronavirus pandemic would come only 1 year later?
105240	This is how pharma companies make their money. It is not with a once a year vaccine it is the once-a-month, week, or day drug they push on you. The covid drug will become something you will need to take monthly, weekly, or even daily. Are you freakin awake yet!!!

105774	@zchagla It's a coronavirus. They can form part of the answer, but utter obsession in vaccinating the whole population with a vaccine that only has emergency use authorisation is downright odd. More so when in relation to those who are not vulnerable to the disease itself.

201564	Aight so, I didn’t want to get vaccinated, but my daughter thought I was going to die (I’d already had covid) if I didn’t get the jab.  Here’s my question: how many of you that have gotten the vaccine now have ear problems? #VaccineSideEffects #COVID19
201685	@ryanfield The vaccine is just a money maker for Pfizer and it doesn't eradicate the virus and because it doesn't the shot will have to be updated and given at least four times of year. I get COVID-19 at this point it's like getting a cold because I've had 3 shots. I've had enough.

105388	@EastSideJay99 @AmyAThatcher Just one quick point to forestall your first gotcha: the scientific name of covid-19 is SARS-COV-2. This is the same virus family that caused the original SARS outbreak mentioned in Scrubs, way back when. That this vaccine was developed in a year is a bad faith argument.

107516	PLEASE RT!  Besides numerous deaths of some of Pfizer's C-19 vaccine volunteers, now this! Is this vaccine really an infertility vaxx? Just one more reason NOT to get any of these vaccines. Instead, eat healthy and beef up your immune system AND🚫annual Flu Vaccine
107121	I think it might not come such a time in my view. Once a pandemic it remains in circulation as long as transmission patterns don't change. We need WHO, CDC and all players to come up with vaccine as we adhere to containment measures given by MOH. Likewise, we commit it to God.
105848	Still no news on when I might could get a coronavirus vaccine, but I sure have gotten multiple news alerts pushed to my devices updating me on the whereabouts of Lady Gaga's dogs. What an age we live in.

105287	Love when clinical trials work themselves out like this. Slow down and do it the correct way and stop trying to be the first company to make a vaccine because you want the funding
105534	@Stratusdog42 @CBCNews Agreed. The sign shows that there has never been a vaccine for any coronavirus ever and all have phased out due to strong T cell immunity.

Why do you think they make a new flu vaccine each year?
105384	So it has come to my attention that in my clip from the movie @MedicatingNorm1 involving @kellybroganmd and it turns out this person is Anti-Vax. Make no mistake Vaccines save lives. Coronavirus is real and unfortunately I made a mistake by not doing a google search.
105785	And further.  I am tired of being treated and spoken to as if I am a disease, because I live in Toronto.  I do not live my life as if getting rid of Covid19/21 is my primary goal in life. Neither do I live my life waiting for some miraculous vaccine.  There is a life to live.
107213	I will not take the vaccine bc @BillGates is involved &amp; wants to put a micro nano-chip in the vaccine. The govt would have to guarantee they did not put anything in the vaccine.
105439	There will always be another variant. Fear controls; we proved it for them last year. Why are they pushing this one experimental vaccine when they never have before? So much so they are 'free'?#ImpeachBidenHarris#CovidFarce #FireFauci

107577	@SpeakUpNoworNev A 2nd wave assumes the first one runs its course.Therefore, no I don’t think there will be a “2nd wave”.I think Covid-19 will continue to run rampant in the US until a vaccine is found and administered, or herd immunity kicks in.#FuckTrump
106782	I got a flu shot last November and got the flu this past March. Even if we get coronavirus vaccine, it’s not going to be a sudden cure-all.

105420	@stephlynn1982 @ScaryLikeAFoxx @e_galv Covid-19 is a disease, not a virus, so it can't be a vaccine. If you meant sars-cov-2 and implied it was a vaccine, it would be a pretty shitty/failed vaccine. The theory is that it started out with the intention of being used for a vaccine for a different coronavirus.

105291	@AlexHeffron88 @pengraiggoch @trishgreenhalgh Yes. So many mums in my FB groups refusing to let schools give their kids the flu vaccine this year just in case the NHS has slipped an experimental Coronavirus vaccine into it. Key fact: “I wouldn’t put it past them”.
105389	"@jym_m @Martina Why was the coronavirus referred to as the ""novel coronavirus""? What does novel mean in this instance? It's not a book you read. It's means new or unknown.

106270	Right. Especially do not take a vaccine Bill Gates has anything to do with, i.e. Moderna.  Bill Gates himself said neither he nor his family will take a COVID19 vaccine. I wonder why?
106389	@MWoody21454002 @caseyjo56279819 @grantstern No vaccine is 100% effective. But in this case, the benefit is that you will almost certainly survive COVID-19 if you do get it. For the past month or so, virtually all of the fatalities were among the unvaccinated.

107496	@beardalaxy @kjenipher_ @callingyou0ut_ @imjustinrandall They've been developing/studying coronavirus vaccines for nearly 20 years. What they did in the last 6 months is similar to what they do with the flu vaccine every year- hone it to be effective against a specific strain of a virus. They didn't start at square one 6 months ago.
106985	@pikashtu Look, I understand the skepticism around the vaccine and what it will do too your body, but we already see what coronavirus can do too your body so I’ll take my chances on the vaccine.

106697	Happy to know my former working place is developing COVID-19 vaccine together with my former campus. 😊
106679	@NateSilver538 They would not be known to be safe if used together. One problem with coronavirus is the virus actually doesn’t do a lot of damage. Most of the disease is unchecked inflammation. We want a vaccine to prevent that fire not make it worse.
107668	If you take this vaccine you are a total fool. Even Bill Gates said a Coronavirus vaccine will kill 700k+ each year taken. This is a cull. The biggest fear is we become herd immune to it. They are rushing the real killer this vaccine ASAP.
106455	@chridano @thejuraisout @DanHitchings @VancityReynolds @jessicamalaty Nope! Covid19 is a strain of coronavirus called SARS‑CoV‑2. Researchers have been working on a generic vaccine for SARS viruses for years. They were able to build on that research. Because Covid is so infectious and has spread so quickly, they have been able to test widely.
106784	Sad to say, @AviBittMD, you did just miss out this whole time. I noticed it way back in Nov 2020. Bolt out of bright blue in my home country. Global scourge. But #ivermectin could work against it as #antisemites are loathsome creatures and also parasites. #COVID19 #vaccines
107480	@bennyjohnson @tedcruz China is weaponizing viruses and covid-19 has been a test.  It crashed the entire world economies so to then it's a success.  Oh and by the way, they now have a vaccine and my guess is the upper echelons of their government had it for months.
105969	With several companies rolling out their coronavirus vaccines what’s the difference between them? Our @MattGregoryNews has the answer #GetUpDC #Verify
106135	Even though I will am in one of the last groups to be eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine, I won't be trying to jump ahead.I do worry there won't be any by the time they get to my group, but am hopeful they will have figured out the manufacture &amp; distribution problems by then.
105359	There is no way to know that in two weeks. Also if it turns out to be 'no' just like with delta we can still expect the jab to be shoved down our throats. Calling it now, they will say only the 'boosted' are protected

107023	@likeitor_lumpit @realDonaldTrump We have a flu vaccine, yes people do die but the way it spreads is not as easily as the corona. We have never seen one person in a nursing care facility get the flu and the whole facility end up with it in a months time! And this is the facts of COVID19.
106962	@Pepe__J All that I can figure is they wanted to scoop up the rest of the BioNTech, Covid-19 vaccine.  Rumor has it there is a new FDA approved formula.
105496	When are nursing facilities going to stop this? WHEN? It's ridiculous. No vaccine, no job. How stupid can people be?
106827	If you’re not Vaccinated already go get the vaccine now no excuses to deny it anymore have a good day
106023	@WVCatholicRadio @CatholicAwesome That's also how Saber looks when you don't get the Covid-19 vaccine because you believe lies and misinformation

106680	@dpakman I started a coronavirus vaccine stage 3 test 2 days ago another shot in a month. But idk if I can get a flu shot for awhile  because it will screw up the information needed for the vaccine. But also I may have only got a  Placebo
106875	Did anyone point out to the idiot #PresidentTrump that #WarpSpeed is a pure fictional term. But then that dies fit what he wants to do, create a #vaccine in 6 months. Pure fiction, promise ANYTHING for sake of #November2020
106645	@realDonaldTrump You are saying the ful and Covid-19 are the same really. Their is a vaccine for the flu,where is the vaccine for Covid-19. There is no safe vaccine to use but they are still trying to find one. Thousands of people dying everyday and you come up with something stupid to say.
105269	@ASlavitt Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
107411	Close to home for us. Please vote in @nicolergalloway for Governor of Missouri.We are well past needing a statewide mask mandate.There will be nothing approaching normal until we first get this under control, then develop a safe and effective vaccine.We don't need a quick one.

105872	I got some good news for everyone, they have found a vaccine for coronavirus but they are doing some final checks on it apparently they should be giving it out at christmas for the vulnerable first, so fingers crossed 2021 will be back to normal 😬👍
107610	@Ms_Michelle_Roy @MarkFriesen08 It's not a vaccine. mRNA is a medical device. It makes you produce viral proteins for what is suspected to be Covid-19 as we do not have this virus isolated and cultured. If we did, we would have an actual vaccine for it. Not going to risk an autoimmune issue like Cytokine Storm.
201749	I’m over 50 and trying to make an appointment for my COVID-19 vaccine but the ACT booking line is overwhelmed and their online booking system won’t accept my Medicare number. At a later attempt told I was 96th in the queue on the phone. Not a lot of vaccine hesitancy here.
106828	So if the so called vaccine for covid19 fails or leads to more deaths do u think the rest of the world will find out about it? I know they didn't talk about the failed 1 in Brasil something to think about.
106292	What is it all about. I'm talking about the sudden spike in Coronavirus all round the world. Quite convenient don't you think. It's a good job we have a vaccine waiting to save the planet. If you are the one waiting for a vaccine   I wish you well, you may just need it...
105798	Why is Bill Gates so pro-vaccine? Is any other rich billionaire donating so many millions of dollars towards a vaccine!? 🤔
106278	Making a vaccine for Coronavirus is not as complicated as making one for AIDS or cancer. It is in the same family as the flu and other Covid viruses. They make a new flu shot every year to predict which strain will be most prominent. This is why the C19 vaccine was made so quick
106934	@DrTomFrieden How come none of those vaccines made it to market?  This is not like other coronavirus, just going to ignore that particular issue?
105440	@GOP keep promoting the anti-vaccine silliness. Is wearing you and your followers down slowly but surely. Blame Trump for downplaying the virus and running off to play golf, only to eventually get his shots, never to confirm it. No sympathy if you play with fire, and get burnt.
106421	Remember in May, when Trump said the coronavirus is “going to go away without a vaccine … and we’re not going to see it again, hopefully, after a period of time” ?

105555	Cuba has a large biotech sector and has to be self sufficient because of the U.S. trade embargo and sanctions.  Cuba 🇨🇺 developed its own vaccine and has a history of distributing it too other countries like Pakistan. #Covid19
105268	This is why the answer can’t be rushed. A vaccine will be developed but don’t rush and cut corners to try and get there.
105519	A career in my field, financial stability, my student loans paid off, and a vaccine for Covid-19 would be nice.
107282	@wane15 Nobody is applying is why.  This whole $15 minimum wage an hour mentality has destroyed the balance.  Also Covid-19 welfare checks too. I as many were making $900 plus a week setting home off work playing video games. It’s going to be much worse if vaccine mandates are imposed.
107354	Yes, I am going to get my mouse friend vaccinated but I’m certainly going to monitor little RatFace for a few weeks before I take take the Kamala vaccine.

106408	@JordanSchachtel If you're getting the annual flu shot, you're getting boosters for the ongoing Swine Flu, which is now endemic... as is COVID19.  If they'd just be up front about how COVID is acting like a normal flu... no.... no, we can't have that. No money in it. Not enough fear.

106220	So this morning I mentioned feeling weird about asking, but I did end up seeing this guy tonight and I asked him if he's vaxxed. He said he got the first Moderna but never went back for the second. Sir!🤦🏾‍♀️ Why are we only half vaxxed? He said his job has someone coming next week!

107509	80% (or as close as we can get) vaccine coverage and rolling booster shots (like we do with flu) and I'll accept we need to move on. Until then we're just accepting unnecessary death.  Restrictions can't last forever which is why we need to ramp up vaccines globally.
105679	Not convinced this is safe until we have a vaccine for Covid-19 as being stuck in a crowded train will spread the virus big time especially if someone doesn't wear a mask and has it even if they don't know they're infected
106801	See how when the vaccines started to roll out in March and April the spread went down 😃Now see how there’s a big population that doesn’t like it and it’s all worse How does that logic work someone explain it to me how do you see it get better and say it’s bad
107357	@TAHPAO2019 @debbiehockey @EmmaKennedy In the case of Covid-19 there is currently no herd immunity. Without a vaccine that is a long long way off.It is spelt 'herd'.The moment you called ma a 'thicko' you lost any respect I may have had for you or your position.Have a good day.

106201	@StephieLynn204 @texaninthewoods @DrEricDing @VickiGSP @IndependentSage You think this virus that’s killed millions of people in just ove a year is beat now? Good luck with that idea. We are doing great with producing vaccines but Covid-19 has been changing quickly as well. Still be careful out there, this battles still on.
106298	I had wondered if what really strains healthcare resources is vaccine skeptics who don't go to the hospital until their symptoms are extremely bad, maybe if they went earlier they could've survived the Covid illness, and easier for hospital staff too - no ICU, no venting, etc.
106666	@PharmaBlue And they don’t want to give vaccines to the pharmacists when they aren’t even offering health benefits for these positions. So we just risk getting COVID-19 and then pay out of pocket if we get sick?? 🤯
201504	Got my second Covid vaccine today!! 💪💉🩹 #teampfizer #2ndvaccine #covid19 @ Santa Clara County Fairgrounds https://t.co/syhN8VBtF4
106209	@cd_hooks I went to get my COVID-19 vaccine; and when they brought out the vial, it clearly read:  ADRENOCHROME 1.0% USP - INNER PARTY USE ONLYIt is so munificent of President Biden to share the special sauce with everyone, in order to quickly build herd immunity
106181	Very realistic. I don't think people understand how important J&amp;J is. They don't have to make sure you are covered for both doses like with Pfizer and Moderna. They can get the vaccine, stab you, and move on.
106219	They need to carry a card saying they refused the vaccine so they can be denied treatment if they catch it.Over 30 percent of Americans say they won't get COVID-19 vaccine: pollhttps://t.co/NgfjXacgcR

107133	@senatemajldr you know how long it took to get a polio vaccine 20 f****** years we don't have a vaccine for AIDS you know how to treat it we don't have a vaccine for a cold a common cold we don't have a vaccine for Coronavirus. Every once in awhile we'll have one I have never
201691	But you know what? I know that if I got COVID-19 last yr or 2 mos ago, I would've died. I have a blood disorder w/c greatly reduced my chances of surviving severe infection.So I heeded health experts' advice. Because, indeed, the best vaccine is the one you can get NOW. 2/3
107229	@ComfortablySmug We've never been able to develop an anti-viral drug or vaccine for any coronavirus ever.To believe this will work, in a matter of months, for a NOVEL virus on top of it.... it's insane.
106534	His news reporters say covid is fake!!! Why would he need one? Why is the rich getting their vaccines before everybody else???
106536	@TomiLahren Why don’t they take down every anti masker post also? The vaccine isn’t 100 percent effective. Covid19 keeps mutating. It’s only a matter of time till this vaccine isn’t effective anymore. Then what?
105927	Another good news just now! Everybody is asking do I still catch the #coronavirus to if I took the vaccine? Well! Pfizer/BioNTech #vaccine gives you 75% chance of NOT getting the virus 12 days after the first dose. #COVID19 #getvaccinated #كورونا #كورونا_لبنان #Covid_19
106437	I don’t care for the @NHSuk as an organisation, but I care for the majority of the people in it. If you do not want the 💉 you absolutely have to refuse it. Current law protects you and I have confidence any new law on such matters would not be passed. Stand firm. #FuckTheJab
201581	Just had my first COVID-19 vaccine. As far as vaccinations go, it’s been the least painful vaccine I’ve ever had. The staff are lovely and it runs smoothly. Don’t be afraid to get the vaccine :)
105862	"""@DonaldJTrumpJr So coronavirus outbreak at CNN, they will refuse treatment until they research the medical staff, vaccine scientists, CEO's to ensure there is enough diversity?  If I call 911, I don""""t give a damn who shows up as long as they are the best."""
107254	@johanknorberg I am impressed that they founded one within a year. If we are comparing the smallpox vaccine and the Covid-19 vaccine the I think it is fair to say it took about a year since the first cases were recorded in November. But the question is, could we have gotten a vaccine earlier?
106402	@SueReed31273001 @richardhorton1 Highly unlikely it will until we know the ling term effects of covid19. Oxford has recently begun a study to address these concerns, but it will take a couple of months for us to see any results. If they want to do challenge studies this will delay the release of a vaccine.
107544	ANY company that forces vaccinations on their people should be sued if anyone gets sick or has a severe reaction to the Covid vaccine! @JohnTory you are not God sir and have no right to force injections on anyone.
106145	I want #JAndJ #vaccine #IWillTakeThisVaccine #SignMeUp #RI #RhodeIsland #johnsonandjohnson @JNJNews can’t wait till we get more in this state so I can get it!
105581	This is what I figured would happen once the virus became endemic, just how H1N1 ended up joining the seasonal flu vaccine after the 2009 pandemic.
106571	The fact that we are on course to (hopefully) crush this virus in less than 2 years is impressive. I figure I'll get the vaccine in August, if the schedule goes as planned.
105678	21/  /animals died.Here’s the lingering issue…“The vaccine makers have no data to suggest their rushed vaccines have overcome that problem.”In other words, never before has any attempt to make a coronavirus vaccine been successful, nor has the gene-therapy technology that
105719	@News24 @BISouthAfrica Thsnk you, good so far,how about a vaccine to prevent #CoronaVirus? That's next field of research
107352	Surprisingly china has less number of cases compared to India,why can't these ppl provide vaccines since they gave the birth to this deadly viruse,y is the world quiet &amp; not having china to pay for all the losses,make them pay for every life that is lost #COVID19 #coronavirus
107138	i’ve made it so far without catching covid why can’t we just stay home until numbers are down and vaccines are out..

106512	Absolutely TERRIFYING and EXACTLY why I will NEVER EVER get a Coronavirus vaccine--even if someone PAID ME!!!!
107190	The roll out of the first approved #COVID19 vaccine today is remarkable. We owe every single person involved in this national effort a huge debt of gratitude.The work continues for our NHS - first in the world to start vaccinating - and for those in research and manufacturing.
105336	I’ve noticed that many don’t even know the Purpose of taking vaccine hence they are celebrating,cause President Cyril Ramaphosa has Covid-19 Advice,do abit of research about vaccine before you start dancing or celebrating ignorance 😂SAD
201669	On 5 th May, I got my first dose of Covid-19 vaccination at Capital Hospital Bhubaneswar. And, i would like to thank our @bmc_bbsr for smooth execution of the vaccine drive. Also,I truly appreciate the @CMO_Odisha
107648	I think the whole world needs to come together on this and share information, instead of just trying to make money off a vaccine. But what do I know 🤷‍♀️?
201571	If I beat covid why’d I get the vaccine my immune system strong asf if the virus so deadly. My immune system like Jordan n the fourth of game 7 n a nba finals a beast! #FUKTHEVACCINE
107530	Just scheduled my vaccine appointment... considering every conceivable facet of my life improved during the COVID-19 pandemic but a Job-like litany of horrors has begun accumulating the past three weeks I fear I have signed my death warrant
106268	I think these seems like a good idea. US is in a bad shape right now with coronavirus and if a vaccine produces 95% success rate, it wouldn't be a bad idea to start testing it in America.
106756	@Dr_Ellie @nadhimzahawi @NHSuk @PHE_uk @KnightAyton @BarneyCalman @EveSimmns @DrNeilStone @BBCBreakfast @thismorning @TomSwarbrick1 Not getting a sticker was the biggest (and only) disappointment when I got both of my COVID-19 vaccines. I only hope my borough rectify this injustice before I get my booster jab 😂
201501	Odd, i do all of those things without having had the covid vaccine. I guess Ill still have to wait for someone to give me a good reason to take this vaccine 🤔
201530	😱Buckle up people. I have a feeling covid-19 was just flexing it's muscles in 2020. Makes me wonder, will the vaccine still work?
106946	@hilaryluros We SO need a Vaccine for: #GaslitTrumpersPerhaps our heroic worldwide scientists can get that out as soon as they have one for the:#CoronaVirus 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
105700	@ShapersJaipur @UNICEFIndia @YuWaahIndia @RajCMO @RajGovOfficial One of the most heard misconception is that coronavirus vaccine is dangerous because it will inject the virus into our bodies, and that is the main reason why so many people are getting affected from it.#covidsupportrajasthan #RajYouthFightCOVID @UNICEF @UNICEFIndia
105348	@NYGovCuomo When can we call for to RESIGN!!!! You had months to prepare for the Covid-19 Vaccine, but kept saying there was NO WAY President Trump was going to get it done &amp; if he did you would not accept it!!! Stop double talking the public.
105303	@AlisonWordsmith I hope you’re right, but since there has never been an efficacious and safe coronavirus vaccine for humans, I’m very doubtful. I think herd immunity is going to have to come from infection, and hopefully mutations make it less dangerous over time. I hope to be wrong
106031	"@Duke_Libertas @JLR59749237 @amlivemon Who is they? And moving what goalposts? A coronavirus vaccine was never gonna be 100% effective like a measles vaccine is. First generation vaccines rarely are.The point of a vaccine is to get enough immunity to ""flatten the curve"" w/less social distancing. That's it."
105552	Getting pretty bored 😐 nothing to do but to watch television and also sometimes go to the store like Walmart or Bi-Mart really good to get out and instead of being stuck in the house or apartment I just hope that this coronavirus will be over and when a vaccine be available
105481	@harrylitman What an idiot!! The vaccine does not prevent you from getting COVID-19 and it didn't stop you giving it to somebody else. Why on earth would you want to force people to take the vaccine?
106755	can you believe because of Trump/GOP (same anti-maskers pushing others out of the way to get the vaccine even though they have the CHOICE to socially distance + Mask) the US is going retrograde to 1918 ????
106658	#COVID19 So if the first #vaccines are free then in 8 months are they charging ? If you want to stay covid free how much will it cost for a lifetime?
107115	There is no vaccine yet for COVID19, I don’t understand what exactly people think will be different “We waited long enough” —do you think that time just magically makes this go away? Like it’ll just stop being super contagious because enough time passed? It’s still circulating.
106442	CALLED IT!!Now.  Taking odds that if Biden wins wonderfully magical the vaccine will be so good for we will lace it in food.
105532	@BCook1978 @chuckwooten @Gangsta_Gumby @GovMikeDeWine Apples to Oranges? Tell me when FLU vaccine has been taken and the person has not got the FLU. Literally everyone I personally know that takes that vaccine every year still gets the flu. So no, it is not apples to oranges. Do you research. Covid-19 vaccine was patented years ago
106859	There are costs incurred with our without a vaccine registry.    The more accurate question is if the cost is greater when we don't keep track. This has been a long-pursued goal of public health for decades.  #COVID19 represents the current pressing need.  There will be others.
107621	Covid-19 is in every corner of this world, we need to work together to get rid of this pandemic. Mask up, sanitize and if you get a chance to a vaccine, take one.
107110	My black ass has hereditary PTSD from that time our government pulled that Tuskegee bullshit. I’m going to pass on the vaccine in the beginning and see how it pans out. Am I being dramatic? Maybe. Better safe than sorry. #COVID19 #vaccine #tuskagee #BidenHarris2020
201720	Thankfully I didn’t get COVID-19 during this pandemic. But I’m 90% sure my job is going to require the vaccine by the fall. It literally makes my job easier with the travel aspects 🙄🙃😒

105248	@ReopenNZProtest Don’t worry. There is NO risk from Covid19 vaccinations :)  - Covid19 is so dangerous, China just tested every single person in Wuhan, millions of tests in 10 days. They are going for eradication. China has the most experience with Covid19. I don’t think there will be a vaccine..
106681	If you are thinking that once a vaccine is developed this will all go away, consider testing:A test was developed in January. In March Trump promised on-demand testing, including an app for easy implementation.In Sept Herbert promised on-demand testing for Utahns. Today:
105803	@Coronavirusgoo1 @Bringon2021Kona @DanielB220201 I think the Oxford one will eventually end up being our prime one.. they were streets ahead of everyone else developing a vaccine in the first place having already partially had one in production for a similar Coronavirus meant to tackle another strain in Africa.
201562	Walked in to @cvspharmacy for my second Moderns shot yesterday. Didn't make an appt, bring my insurance card, or bring my #COVID19 vaccine card, and they still got me the shot. #NoExcuses
106561	But they’re not getting the real vaccine! This is the biggest lie that will befall on the American people! Do not trust the Deep State!
106403	Fact: No, COVID-19 vaccines have not been linked to infertility after COVID-19 infection. There is no vaccine microchip, and the vaccine will it affect the vaccine?

105859	JUST FUCKING TAKE THE COVID-19 VACCINE.I know you will still get the virus, but it prevents you from reuniting with the creator.
107102	@resisterunited @RepThomasMassie What you’re wanting to do is perpetually be inoculated for a strain that doesn’t exist because you’ll never be able to make a vaccine quick enough. This is why coronavirus vaccines don’t make any sense, let alone use tech that doesn’t have lasting effects.
105765	@TheEconomist Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
106876	@starsandstripes Can I ask why??? If getting the shot doesn’t help not get Covid-19 and only helps you fight it IF you catch it. So why the fuss if the shot doesn’t help not catch Covid-19? I could understand if it defeated Covid out right but the vaccine doesn’t do this.
201655	In early 2020 my Rottweiler jumped on my back and landed just the right way to break one of my vertebrae. In December 2021 I contracted COVID-19 despite being fully vaxxed and fully masked. The possibility of slipping and falling on ice no longer scares me.

106108	@Liz_Wheeler No, no he isn't. There's a high likelihood (though not yet conclusively proven) that we can protect vaccine-intolerant people from contracting COVID-19 if enough of us receive the vaccine, including our healthy kids. Herd immunity is basic vaccine science.

107375	Looks like we have another Covid orphan, on purposeWill this child grow up in poverty because their father chose Covid over a free vaccine?
107519	What the hell have they people totally lost it😠Does it mean the person who are voter for them only who will not vote or those who doesn't live in Bihar the vaccine will cost them and those who will vote for them it'll be free🤬It's enuf if u still can't see now then u'll never🙏🏻
105523	Crude oil drops to 0, Kim Jon un bed ridden, no vaccine for coronavirus...This is the end. Before it's all over I just want to say you are the ugliest human on Earth.
105800	America is such a great evil… this is so twisted1. This is telling everyone in America to fuck themselves if they end up in the hospital cuz they’ll go broke 2. This is also excluding the entire population of people who get the vaccine and still end up sick in the hospital🥴
107097	EVERYONE IS GOING FOR VACCINE ONLY.....I THINK SO NO ONE IS LOOKING FOR MEDICINE OF COVID....KINDLY WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION MAKE SOME MEASURES TO FIND THE MEDICINE FOR COVID...AND ALL WE WANT TO TOOK OFF OF THE K AND WE WANT TO STAY HAPPY..#Covid_19 #WHO#COVID19
105477	Would you take the vaccine? #vaccine #COVID19 #Covid19UK (share please so we can get a broader data) Thanks all. :)
106987	Prior to having an injection into my arm + that of my family, @celliottability - will you please advise all of the ingredients in the vaccine.
107207	How could They? We need to investigate Nursing Homes?  Short of Vaccine, States Find Hidden Stashes in Their Own Backyards Millions of coronavirus vaccines are sitting in freezers, allocated in excess to nursing homes or stockpiled for later use.
105716	@DavidCo13075549 @WRAL Unvaccinated people should be denied treatment if they get COVID19 .. they exercised their rights not to get vaccine so hospitals should exercise their rights not to treat them

106800	"@foundmyfitness @YouTubeCreators My frustration with the pro-vaccine is mainly that the argument is ""Covid-19 is bad.  Get the vaccine.""  No shit, Covid-19 is bad.  But I don't think the vaccine is the way out.  My mother can't get her platelet levels down post vaccination."
105393	Okay, Wisconsinites, we know that even with eligibility opening up it’s going to take some time to get vaccines in everyone but isn’t this great news?!? #OnWisconsin  #wisconsin
105902	We need mandatory vaccines and we should wear masks when inside because it's actually a very easy thing to do to protect kids that can't get vaccinated.Like my ten year old. She's what I think about every time I see an elected try to be cute about doing one and not the other.
106283	@JustinTrudeau @yfblanchet Congratulations @JustinTrudeau . The Liberal government has done it again and made us laughing stock to our international partners. What happened to boasting about having the largest vaccine portfolio. Only looks good on paper.

105924	The business has already begun... The poor who cannot even afford a cylinder will now have to shell out money for a vaccine too... Our world is just so horribly doomed.This vaccine needs to be subsidized even more for the masses. Make it free for God's sake. It's a pandemic!
106659	Dr. Fauci is evil. If you or a loved one ever had a vaccine and really how many of us have not, you will be shocked if this is true. Quick 7 min video and you may refuse ever to take a vaccine again! If true this is really scary! 🤔😯
106840	@washingtonpost BS ALERT‼️ The full WH statement said you can't defeat a virus like Covid-19 until we get the vaccine, and the vaccine is coming soon. Follow the science WAPO, you can't defeat this virus with a new politician. Under President Trump we'll have the vaccine in record time.
107353	@catturd2 @KarenCurnock Women may not want to get the Coronavirus vaccine while pregnant.  Just ask the thalidomide babies.
107056	I do not wish bad on him. But, the irony here is palpable. Hopefully, this will cause him to push hard for a vaccine/solution. Is Joe Biden in danger, now, since they were on stage together, just a couple days ago?

106323	@GovCanHealth We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies. Please help! 🙏🙏

106584	@fosterhimself @DevilPup74 @dswhisperer2 You want proof? Note where the Coronavirus vaccine is being developed? The US, not a country with socialized medicine. As has nearly every vaccine, medication, or medical procedure developed in the past half century.  You will kill 10's of millions through sheer greed.
106462	@goshorn_s @sjocello I am also not an anti-vaccination person. I agree that I would also get the coronavirus vaccine if Dr. Fauci says it is 100% safe. He is the only person in @realDonaldTrump's administration that I trust.
107664	I just lost my first Twitter argument  in approximately 5 years to @LouisAnslow over a feature I mistakenly thought was intentionally disabled. But in my defense, I blame low blood, having a bad day, economic anxiety, Meghan Markle, and the COVID-19 vaccine for my error.
106969	@IainFletcher8 @AnthonyRuss126 @PUSBradders @wireinthebrain @Gordonhannay @talkRADIO Anyone that thinks lockdowns are the way forward and good for mental health is on another planet. Covid is not going away just like the flu. Similar in every single way hence a vaccine is available for both. I’m pro choice. It’s my choice to say no an live my life 👍#COVID19
106415	Follow health guidelines. It's not a whim. The gov is not out to get you. It is for everyone's protection.Seatbelt = vaccine, protects you in case you catch covid19 Speed limit = mask. Protects those around you in case you get covid and reduces the CHANCE of getting it.
107253	#coronavirus  @Israel will have a vaccine in two weeks, of course, this means everyone in Iran will get sick and 2% will die
106199	Nope ! I'm getting my shot !  I've had a real bad case of flu !  I don't want another !  And, I'll take the  Covid19 vaccine as soon as it's available ! Not falling for the Dem scare tactics !  You're lucky you've never had a bad case of flu ? 🤭🤭🤭🤧🤧🤧🤒🤒♥️♥️
107062	How are they endangering others if everyone else is vaccinated? Do the vaccines work or don’t they? Truck question, they do work. I don’t care if I sit next to an unvaccinated Covid patient, I’m fully vaccinated and won’t get sick. #COVID19 #CovidVaccine

106738	Takde kena mengena just nk cerita I pestered my mom to watch Cells at Work anime with me &amp; there were eps where they explained abt our immune system &amp; how vaccines work. I’m proud to say tht right now my mom with zero medical background can easily explain to others how it works.
105438	China's rapid test kits are 94% faulty, we know what 'Made in China' stands for.Seems like China wants to use Pakistanis as lab rats for their vaccine's human trial and these stupids are cheering it. 🤷🏻‍♂️🤐#Coronavirus #ChineseVirus #WHOhanVirus #WuhanVirus #ChinesePropaganda
105985	I’ve interviewed a Canadian Hip Hop star who promoted coronavirus vaccine conspiracy theories through huge Facebook groups, a mum in the UK sucked in by what he shared - and disinfo fighters helping those down the Bill Gates rabbit hole! If you know anyone like this, DM me 📧
105560	@thomaskaine5 Being immune compromised with MS, I never stopped masking up going out in populated settings when the restrictions started to lift. I’m also vaccinated with the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. I was practicing social distancing long before this pandemic.
105449	I don’t know what’s more amazing, that the microchip is so small that no one has actually found it in the vaccine yet, or that something designed as a conduit to microchip the world population is also so effective against coronavirus. Science man.
106874	"@EricMMatheny The COVID-19 ""vaccine"" is not a traditional vaccine. It does not work in the same way vaccines typically do...It is a toxic jab, nothing more &amp; nothing less."
106508	If you haven’t gotten the Covid-19 vaccine yet, would you get it if your primary care physician told you it is safe to get it?
105828	This is coming fast and furious. Your vaccine status may get you into restaurants, theatres, sporting events, cultural events, hotels, planes and concerts. What do we need to consider as we roll this out? @bmj_latest #GetTheJab #VaccinesWork
107108	On to the next clinical phase! To see if the vaccine is able to produce the same neutralising antibodies against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in humans #COVID19
105616	I think there is still much uncertainty regards everything to do with this virus Covid19 that only time will tell? How can you know about immunity when the virus is only 5-6 months old? Even the efficacy of vaccine can't be hundred percent correct until trials confirm success.
107296	No! What we will be remembering is how the UK failed so badly in dealing with COVID-19 and how it tried to claim credit for a vaccine developed in Germany, led by German-Turkish scientists and manufactured in Belgium !!
107184	Seems to be going well. Lets hope sanctions get lifted. Iran needs medicines. They need the Covid-19 vaccine. #Iran
106111	Our country has been through a lot. Be extra kind to one another. I posted this on my towns fb page Anyone in our community who is 80+ who may need a ride for vaccine please let me know, I know times are tough &amp; don’t want anyone needlessly paying for a ride. #covid19 #love
106788	@RMGirlUK It shows if your immune system has responded to the Covid-19 vaccine as it should.I don’t think it’s a bullet proof guarantee as we don’t know what level of antibodies is ‘enough’ yet but I’m pretty happy with over 2,000 -it provides some reassurance my vaccine will protect me.
106477	"@Neural_Monk @naval @EckhartTolle @joerogan @elonmusk @JimCarrey Just to the point that ""we are not able to make a vaccine"", if you had known the fact that coronavirus vaccine is on track to be the fastest ever made vaccine in the humankind, had you known the fact how time taking is the process, you wouldn't probably question that process."
201785	I got the covid-19 vaccine yesterday and my side effects were massive headache(common), fever in the morning, and body ache, my feet hurt like that kind of pain when you’re out in the snow and they get so cold and they’re all numb 🙍🏽‍♀️ but I’m better now 😇
105338	No way in hell my black ass is signing up for this. Y’all think we forgot about Tuskegee? Henrietta Lacks? The Puerto Rican women used to experiment hormonal birth control on? I’ll be staying home with my mask up til the vaccine is sorted all the way out.
106503	Our KeMri is likely to take 7yrs to come up with a vaccine for covid19... sounds like a joke to me, Europe should just be allowed to try their vaccine here_thinking out loud
105836	@BradHazzard Minister can you please explain what the “Delta Virus” is?  Is it worse than the SARS-CoV-2 aka CoronaVirus?When will you have a vaccine for this new threat that you just made up during the media conference this morning? #idiot #COVID19nsw #nswpol
106911	I am now singlehandedly finding the vaccine for covid19 they cannot take my boys away from me like this
106244	If only those who did not get vaccines because of politics would get their vaccines(that would include those that believed all trash u were fed about freedom, vaccine  &amp; suggestions of what would work like horse dewormer)would get their vaccines this world would be better place
105743	I'm calling this bullshit 👇👇👇They maintain their experimental vaccine, without long term data, known to not protect you from the virus but expected to reduce the symptoms, is better protection than your immune system after you've had the virus??
107643	I can't tell if this person is serious or not? Do people actually think that a vaccine will alter your DNA???
201605	"And those who took the vaccine thought ""Thats my life back now""....Nope. Oh and they can go screw themselves (government)"
107407	The correct response to Eric would have been:No, dumbass, your father didn’t take a vaccine - do you even know what they are? Boy are you incredibly stupid
105992	Thats wonderful news. 3 vaccine data released in a span of 30 days is tremendous. More exciting is the fact that these were developed in under a year when it actually takes a decade to develop! Kudos to all brilliant scientists, doctors and engineers 👏🧬🙏🏽
105508	@vonderleyen @EU_Commission @GlblCtzn Absolutely not !. The flu is 100 years old and there are vaccines for flu, there is new medicine etc. and flu still exists. Coronavirus is only 5 months old, so saying that vaccine is a panacea is irrational. Good vaccine must be tested a minimum of 5 years !. ♥️🇪🇺
106925	HEY DICKHEAD, can we get mask and vaccine mandates so we don’t get COVID-19 in the first place? Because the thing about getting COVID-19 is YOU THEN KEEP SPREADING IT.
106464	"@REFORM Stop daydreaming please ! ""when this pandemic is all over"" is not going to happen any time soon. ""Back to normal"" is just an illusion. That sh.t is here to stay. Remember we're waiting for a HIV vaccine for what, just 35 years ? #coronavirus"
107241	"@andrewjonsso @DragonReinier #NHS stats: Every person who had a flu jab last season, and who then took a #Covid or ""#Coronavirus"" test this year, has tested positive. Every. Single. One. And if you test +ve, you ""must"" then have a vaccine. Feeling manipulated yet? #Plandemic"
106600	5 years from now you’ll see commercials like “if you or a loved one has received a COVID-19 vaccine, you may be entitled to financial compensation”
107247	This is why we are starting our child with virtual learning. I need to see my son is safe before he goes back. If I'm wrong oh well, but if I'm right... Many Parents &amp; Teachers are not OK w going back. It's rushed and we feel pushed. Covid has no real treatments or vaccine. @CNN
201710	@NarcityCanada Just guessing the first to get the vaccine will be DoFo and his front line politicians, the covid-19 task force, certain wealthy CPC donors, DoFo's OPP drinking buddies, Lecce's Vaughan Working Families... then?
106687	@dez_blanchfield America should be joining in on this via @SecPompeo despite some theories that an American may be involved. Seriously, how could Bill Gates have patented a vaccine already if there wasn't already a virus to do so? And when did that covid19 antiviral VAX actually get patented?
107338	@JulietteJDI @DPJHodges of coronavirus and those for flu have to be developed every year based on surveillance of mutations in human influenza viruses. The vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 will be similar. It is likely that at-risk groups will require an annual vaccine. And actually as with flu, sadly, if we
107024	The new normal, will be a world where humans are susceptible to both coronavirus end influenza and it will be as normal to get vaccines regularly as it was 2 years ago to get the flu vaccine, except now everyone will get one.  3/3
106064	Myth: I am allergic to eggs so I shouldn't get the COVID-19 vaccine than would actually die from the virus.
105234	@FleurEbru Exactly. Stupid people vote for this sick political party because the more kids you have the more free money from the goverment you get. Those are the same people who are anti vaccine and that don't believe that coronavirus really exist. I want out of this country.
106994	I just knew it! …. People really need to ask why the media is party to this elaborate con to get us all jabbed! - this has a Michie psych op written all over it!
106225	In terms of preventing infection, I have to say that vaccines are pretty much similar. There's a chance, even if it's 5% or 50%. However a vaccine's main job is to train your immune system to make the right antibodies. If it can do that, then it's effective.
105596	How I Got Covid-19 Vaccine A Thread Disclaimer : I am working in Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦, so I got my vaccine for free here. Thank you Saudi Gov 💚
106374	I just can’t understand how they’re even going to monitor something like this… these vaccine certificates and cards are so easy to fake anyway 🤡
106657	@talkRADIO Why would i get a vaccine that may compromise my immune system against future viruses for covid-19 that i am 99.7% able to survive or 33% asymptomatic and no illness at all
107490	40. How exactly is it that (they say) one can have the COVID-19 virus, recover, but not be immune. Yet, a vaccine, for a virus they still don't understand, is going to give you immunity?41. Why is this virus political?
201579	I just want to point out, for those who visit my tweets, that I am not anti-vax, I have all mine as does my child. I am just not getting this COVID-19 vaccine. Everyone else is free to get jabbed.
107453	Arnold is a complete idiot. He is the problem with China. I got COVID-19 and it was just like having a cold. Your natural immunity is better then the vaccine.
106308	I fucking hate needles with a passion and still would beg to be pricked in the arm with a COVID-19 vaccine. How the hell do I get an appointment without just lying about my eligibility? This whole process has been whack.

106583	@GovInslee FACT - Covid-19 is in the human pop. 4 good, fast or slowFACT - mask wearing only slows it down; it can't stop itFACT - herd immunity doesn't mean that no one will ever catch it again, it just reduces the likelihoodFACT - there has NEVER been a vaccine for a coronavirus. EVER.
106047	@PrisonPlanet Sad, the worst part is she did it she said to protect her cancer patients but the vaccine according to the experts only reduces symptoms, it cannot stop a person from getting or spreading covid19.

105222	"The Prophet of God called this vaccine ""a literal Godsend"". In my mind, that eliminates any excuse for not getting it. You either trust the Prophet or you don't. Unless you have some valid, diagnosed medical reason not to get this specific vaccine, this should be no problem."

I don’t like Pfizers vaccine, it sounds like they cut &amp; sliced DNA.
106172	oh btw guys a US pharma company is in the court to prevent china getting COVID19 vaccine because they gon sell it for 50-100$ per person and China after getting the vaccine planning to distribute it for free.
105631	We will continue to get vaccines in the arms of folks like Mr Pillord below @The_BMC and elsewhere, whilst we root for manufacturers and supply chains to get them to our sites ASAP. We are rooting for everyone to get this to work. #CiaoCovid.
107160	Wonder if Tesla drivers could volunteer to deliver COVID-19 vaccine to rural hospitals in need. @tesla could give those in the volunteer group free Supercharging to sponsor the event. I’d like to help somehow. @kimpaquette ??
107203	@JonIsAwesomest we developed a dozen coronavirus vaccines in nine months but haven't worked out a non-addictive morphine in two centuries?c'mon, science.  i want to like you.

201641	Doing the work of mystery Babylon...listen to the guy who got jabbed, sounds just like the television.
107645	Religious places should be shut down till the vaccines arrives.See no one is going to die without going to prayer places,they can worship in home too but they might die if they go to there now amid this pandemic.No god is going to curse you for not coming to worship them!

106605	like he didn't receive polio vaccine. It's good to believe but some things are not meant to be taken for granted. I will see what he will do when the UK govt start making it compulsory for travellers entering their country to get vaccinated.
106269	@Canada_Dystopia The rush is their worst nightmare. As with previous coronavirus vaccines, this one is enhancing variant strains and ppl are getting really sick.
201542	Third day muscle pain is located to my bicep and I can feel my body start to tear this apart. More HSP symptoms are presenting themselves, and while none of those symptoms are fun, I still gotta watch myself #CovidVaccine #CovidIsNotOver #COVID19
105979	@disclosetv So what is the intention of these vaccines?....it is not the protection against the coronavirus 🤔
106053	How are we going to do that without a vaccine? No vaccine no heard immunity. The Antibodies are lasting weeks or less.
107403	@SHarris518 @POTUS No coronavirus has ever had a vaccine developed. Even if we get 1 it will likely b less than 50% effective, which means a larger number of people likely won't get one, adding. I agree therapeutics is the way to go. The rest I believe is futile. Wash hands, drink OJ. Respectfully
106362	Hope has arrived! It will take months, but we’re now on our way out of this. So, don’t give up the fight now.Wear a mask. Maintain social distance. Be smart. And *be here* when it’s your time for the vaccine.Let’s all survive this now and celebrate like hell when it’s done.
106643	@NASA @NASA_Astronauts @Astro_Soichi @JAXA_en @NOGGINKids Will astronauts get the Covid-19 vaccine or can they decline to have it if they are personally against being injected?
105739	I really hope it comes to that! The new variant (plus this variant's variant now) is so terrifying, esp. bc the vaccine will be less effective. This applies to the B1351 as well. HQ is not adequate!
106690	@VlkzOstravy @washingtonpost @MorganStanley How do you think the globalists got a huge supply of miracle vaccines in short order. They money laundered through Afghanistan. Then they created a coronavirus pandemic. Our benefactors are psychopaths.
105611	Logically the peak is 2 - 3 weeks after Easter just like it was after Xmas. Hope we get enough vaccines before May 24

105899	@margauxdemerle @realDonaldTrump I am really hoping this isn't true.  But these days who knows.  The @UN should be coordinating vaccine research and dispersal.  It should go first to where the need is greatest.  If covid-19 has taught us anything, we are one planet.  Boarders are meaningless. We are all humans.
106133	Had my COVID-19 vaccine today, just doing my part to help the world return to normality. @piersmorgan keep preaching how important this is to help us get back on track after the governments poor handling :)
106647	"so now that there's ""chismis"" going around Mandaue City Public Market (since we do have business there) na we have to get vaccinated to enter the market...my mom's getting the vaccine somehow but she's afraid to get vacs due to her high blood."
106626	@NI_Citizen_69 @paddyakker @AlexKane221b Why are employers sacking the un-vaxxed - the vaxxed can still get Covid-19 and still spread it to others - so there is no protection of staff or customers ??? Can any employer or manager or MP explain this ???
106122	@sandwichtable69 @TwTankersley @PaulStanleyLive Influenza vaccine is around 70% effective, so in no way would any virologists expect to see a Covid19 vaccine offer complete protection. You also seem to think that chickenpox vaccine is 100% effective too. It's not like the information isn't readily available. 🤦
107003	@robertscott661 @JamesGr49498338 @Warnzwifey @BorisJohnson Some slack heads think we should have lockdown until zero deaths. We may never have a vaccine it may be seasonal just like flu we might have to live with it forever. A different coronavirus is the cause of most common colds. It's just life. Natural immunity will squash it
106776	I can still get it! If I contract it in the next 14 days the vaccine would've been for nothing but I'd also have some immunity for an unknown amount of time.If I get covid after the 14 days, I'm a lot more likely to be asymptomatic then before the vaccine. 💜🦆

106912	US has to vaccinate the world. Please don't expose people to sinovaccine. It will be terrible. People can and are getting infected with coronavirus after being vaccinated. This may mean people in the future will not want to get vaccinated.#PeoplesVaccine #FreeTheVaccine
201739	I knew about this but it’s still pretty amazing how a system can be so ridiculous. My grandparents needed to travel 400 km from their home to get COVID-19 vaccinations, as it was the only place with free spots for vaccine.#COVID19Vaccination #Polska
201539	@NPRHealth I have RA, narcolepsy, sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes, asthma, treated cancer with chemo and radiation in 2019. I had my 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 3/27. I only felt sore at the injection spot, some joint pain and a little fever for less than 24 hours. Always Ask your doctor
105620	I’m no scientist or whatever but if they just integrate the COVID-19 vaccine in alcoholic drinks, we’d achieve herd immunity by Saturday night. No cappin.

107037	@darinsquared @RealTenille There would be no need for COVID-19 protocols to protect people if there were other ways. There is only social distancing and masks wearing. In many months, there will be a vaccine or two.
105943	I still think we could do more, but today I'm proud that my country doesn't just think of us. We don't do vaccine nationalism. Every human being on this planet matters and we won't defeat Covid-19 if we don't provide vaccines for everyone on this planet.
107644	@NeilClark66 @ejaz_nouman Coronavirus pandemic will become more deadly and destructive to our normal lives if it gets mixed-up with seasonal viral flu , a safe and effective vaccine is therefore necessary asap

106029	Did they need a vaccine? No. Did they equate the only possible response to Covid-19 is a Vaccine? No. Did they ban flights and acted fast to opt for medical solution? Yes. Duterte's take only having the vaccine as the only solution is evident enough to say...
107278	Please take any Coronavirus surveys from the DNA companies so we can help find a vaccine or a medical solution to this pandemic. It only takes a few minutes of your time. I know that MyHeritage is doing a survey. I did my part.
201666	Last Wednesday, April 7th 2021;My hubby and I drove to Nephi, Ut. to get my 2nd #COVID19 shot. By evening I had some pain in my arm, where the shot was and I massaged it, helping to break up the liquid of the vaccine. I started getting Chills, Fever,Nassau with vomiting, etc.😷 https://t.co/j8hykENFTI
105757	@nirav_mainecdc Discrepancies in reporting. Maine is getting more/less vaccines depending upon different sources. How convenient! Less vaccines fits narrative of why Maine is not prioritizing long-term care facilities? Outrageous! Do not try to say that you are doing a good job!

105567	Hydroxychloroquine has proven to be a real treatment for COVID-19 but since Trump was the first one to say it, the left and the FDA are going to make sure they keep it away from Americans so they can promote another Bill Gates vaccine. #Hydroxychloroquine #WakeUpAmerica
105871	@juil_yoon @oclsc @TheoMoudakis @TorontoStar See they claim to do research yet sound like lunatics. Did you even fukin know that when the polio or the measles came out, people took a vaccine immediately with way less data than today’s very effective and safe Covid19 vaccine. Where is the polio today? Time to grow up kids
107609	Why should either one of them get a vaccine for a hoax? They should’ve been last in line for all the death they’ve caused!
107004	@mrscorer Think you need to do a bit of research. They are between 40-60% and we’ve had the flu vaccine for 70+ years. People believed Covid-19 vaccines were 95% effective in 9 months 🤣 huh? 1000 deaths? 150?

106166	@KisakumaCosplay Well, we indeed have reasons to think that things will get better in 2021, like the COVID-19 vaccine. But we certainly have to keep pushing if we want things to get better, and not assume it will happen on it's own.

105812	@SethAbramson I fear this might become like the flu, where a vaccine won't be wholly effective every year. (Although, based on how they're trying to develop an all-encompassing flu shot, maybe you could do the same if you could tease out the *original* Covid-19 strain.)
105573	It’s the year 2025 and we’re just going into our 16th national lockdown, which they say will definitely see the beginning of the end of this coronavirus. The promised vaccine is just weeks away, again. #Lockdown2 #Covid19UK

105513	@SecAzar @JapanEmbDC This is good, but you should be updating the nation about the #coronavirus potential pandemic on an almost hourly basis, considering you are essentially the point-man for handling this disease.   Will there be a worldwide epidemic? Is a vaccine coming? Please inform us!
107397	@AertbyLisa I've had a flu jab each year. A mild cold will permanently worsen my ME/CFS, but a flu jab just makes me a bit worse for a week.They say COVID-19 and the flu are a deadly combination, and the first person to die in Europe was a young man who had both, so I'm getting it again.

105773	@BrandonPerna @AdamSchefter Have to wonder how any of these contracts will work out. There isn't going to be an NFL season until there is a COVID-19 vaccine. How can any team sport deal with sick or contagious players that will have to sit for 14 days at a time?
106426	@GavinNewsom The mortality rate is so low. Plus there's a vaccine on deck. We've already flattened the curve once. The Coronavirus is being used for another purpose......Socialism,  Global Reset. Period. All Democrats on board.
105233	Receiving news about someone passing bc of Covid19 (more like, govt negligence) will never be easy. Ingat everyone! If may opportunity offered sa company or LGU for vaccines, pls grab it. Palakasan talaga ng immune system to. Get every protection you can get. Its real.
105693	Wait, but they do? We always said, get the jab if you want, don't force me. When is bodily autonomy acceptable to these people? Only when it's convenient for them?
106707	@DaveKeatley One thing is clear. This is no time to open borders, not until the Chinese Communist Party allows the Wuhan Institute of Virology to release ALL the information about the COVID19 in order to make vaccines fully functional. Right now they are not.
106902	Dear God,Please let this Covid-19 vaccine be the thing that'll wipe out ignorant and stupid people (because they're those who'll refuse to take the vaccine and then later get the virus and die). Amen.

105598	Another one to add to the cocktail, truly I will take them all, just mix em up like a Long Island Iced Tea and jab it in!!!
106175	Indeed. Really happy US will donate vaccine to poorer countries where it's desperately needed. And my teenage daughter and I (both US citizens living in Thailand) would love to get vaccinated, but not possible so far. #taxedbutnotvaxxed

106498	@CalebHowe Don’t y’all see it some kids didn’t get the vaccines and they are just fine like me I never got and never get Covid-19 as well hmm seems to me like the vaccines is the one messing with peoples dna 🧬 and killing them 😮‍💨
105948	I’m so confused on why people care about what someone they’ll never come into contact with is doing. Let him not take the vaccine or take it. The science on BOTH sides has relative pros and cons.This shaming shit is for weirdos and sheep.
107103	@anthonyfurey :  as you know, there is nothing scientific about this.Either we believe in the vaccines, or we don't.@erinotoole ánd @fordnation are perpetuating unscientific fear.The new variant is more transmissible, but more mild = borders should remain open.
106410	@ProfAdeeba University of Oxford researchers have begun testing a COVID-19 vaccine in human volunteers in Oxford today. Around 1,110 people will take part in the trial, half receiving the vaccine and the other half (the control group) receiving a widely available meningitis vaccine.
105659	"@emmaogreen Vaccines are NOT 100% effective.MIllions in the U.S. REFUSE to take the vaccine.Kids under 16 aren't vaxxed yet. Kids spread the virus just like everyone else. There is no longer the ""virus"" but COVID-19 and its many mutations.So yeah, I'm still wearing a mask."

This vaccine has been in the making since the first major SARS-Cov outbreak in the early 2000’s. The cervical cancer prevention vaccines and an mRNA vaccine are completely different.
106845	I don't understand why it's become so difficult in my area to be tested for coronavirus. Kinda lame. Proof of antibodies should equal vaxxed or a negative result.
107120	You are like this coronavirus for my heart, infected me badly..no medicines, no vaccine! I hope my future husband is reading this, pls come into my life asap and save me !
106810	The COVID-19 vaccine should be tested on @OfficialPDPNig members first . If they survive the vaccine is safe , if they don't NIGERIA  is safe.  Thank you all .
105632	“This is a good day for me and for my family. The vaccine will help protect me now, especially after my second shot. We will all still follow #COVID19 measures, but I think the vaccine is the most important solution to the pandemic. We will all feel a little safer today onwards”.

107167	Don't be naive. So what if it is approved by FDA? It doesn't change the fact that the vaccine is not safe. Do not think that the government has your best interest in mind.
201509	omg i did the covid19 booster yesterday im not okay rn my arms hurt a lot like if someone is continuously punching my arm and I feel reeeeeaaaally lazy and tired
105879	No vaccine for me! They have reverse actions, flu shot got me the flu was sick for 3 weeks. If I get it I’ll take the therapeutics.
106480	@POTUS What gives @Twitter @twittersupport ? Why allow all this constant misinformation regarding Covid-19 vaccinations??? It is an indisputable fact that vaccines CANNOT ensure that you don't get the mutating virus, same as the flu...so why allow all the lies?? F'ing disgusting...
105209	We might be getting the vaccines??? A big win. Please get them from Ramaphosa’s country and please adopt the system and protocols they have to acquire it.

107660	@osquare78 @channelstv My brother everybody is not covid-19 vaccine compliant. It's not by force to take the vaccine. So if you deemed it fit to do so, fine no need insulting people who don't want to take it. It's a free world. Why It's so hard for some people to drive home their points without insults

106487	This is how they will get around a mandatory vaccine. Cut funding from anyone the doesn’t require it 😡
107566	@RealKidPoker To research vaccines and treatments for all known viruses, now the coronavirus is a large family but rechearching and creating vaccines would've been paramount. And create tons of masks for doctors and stockpile them for when these things happen because we've got a mass shortage.

106806	@MadFckingWitch @davidsmosspiggy Article pulls a few negative quotes from several researchers to paint a gloomy picture. The reality is 1) The odds of a viable vaccine are good, 2) No coronavirus until this one has been able to infect the lower lungs, so comparing to prev. CVs is unhelpful.
107534	But when it comes to vaccine distribution it is still unclear on equal distribution once health care workers done.  Make these in Usa in bulk and distribute as immunity only last less than 6 months @vivek_murthy
106619	It would be a real shame if all these political leaders and celebrities that are getting recorded taking the vaccine are actually getting an empty syringe to trick the masses....
106598	@coldo71369284 @HagemasterBeth @realDonaldTrump Same goes for the coronavirus; why do you think so many politicians that said the virus is a hoax but yet they are first in line to get the vaccine?  And why are so many non-believers wearing masks (most improperly or never cleaning it)...

105223	@aldatweets @ohdannyboy12 the vaccine does not prevent people from getting coronavirus or spreading it. (it does other things.) every single person being vaccinated (which I am btw) would not 100% wipe out coronavirus. these tweets are tiresome.
106603	Can someone explain why we keep calling it a #COVID19 #vaccine?? Vaccines provide IMMUNITY to a virus. These are shots to BOOST our immune system,  they do NOT make you immune!! I still think we should all get the shots, but I think we should be honest in what it does!
107087	I don’t know what they put In vaccines , but I thought they put the virus in them Coronavirus is common, it’s just the strain we look at , correct?Do the ppl that are being tested and have had a positive result also have had  the flu vaccine?
107505	@KurtBusch just heard it suggested on MSNBC that NASCAR drivers (and other athletes) get the Coronavirus vaccine to ramp up the trust of the skeptics in the country. Sounds good to me! Hope you are getting yours soon!!  ❤️🦋❤️🇺🇸🏁
107214	How have they been testing the new coronavirus vaccines? Has anyone who has gotten the vaccine been exposed to the live virus or is the effectiveness all hypothetical?
106265	Every day of my life, senior citizens call me desperate to get the vaccine. I’ve even had veterans call me. Seems to me that you would give these 40 shots to an American who actually loves our country not a terrorist. #comeonman
107541	@FreeThinker003 #covid19vaccine is so harmful it can change DNA I got my Covid-19 vaccine card without getting jabbed  STAY AWAY FROM THE VACCINE  ⛑ WE PRAY ALL THIS ENDS ANYTIME SOON,Beep Doctor John for your COVID card Text his whatsapp +13303666542 💚 this my way of helping 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
106479	Prediction:Many vaxed will talk a big game about how this is it. They will then line up and get their booster so they can keep their QR codes green.Just like they've done every step of the way.
105350	@truth_seeker_85 @EASYMONEY75 The covid-19 virus  is Quickly running its course and going to disappear in the not-too-distant future, just as the SARS - 2 virus did. The only people interested in continuing this are the politicians the government and big Pharma. As with SARS 2 no vaccine is needed.
105501	Now you have my attention 😏Seriously though, if I was going to get a shot that would do nothing for me, there are much worse reasons than free beer.  I got 6 rounds of Anthrax vaccine in the Marines and usually had to come up with my own beer and entertainment...
107227	@CornerRadish @therealmissjo @jon_mumford1982 You give no reason, that's unhelpful.There is no cure for coronavirus-19, until a vaccine is developed.An apparently healthy can carry the virus for upto 27 days before symptoms show.During that incubation period an infected person infects others.Isolation is the only defense
107303	This will be great and extremely helpful with using up the extra vaccines Mississippi has due to rejections #SPRING21mcj2031/27
105322	@jitterbug212 I'm sorry. I'm at work. Trying to say that even the common cold (which is a coronavirus) has no vaccine. And testing would be an endless cycle.
106802	And another!He actually admits that a person who fully recovered from #COVID19 gives them a decreased chance to get it again!  Then he switched back to #vaccines Sell $$$$them Doc don't let them think their own #Immunity might work!
105343	My mom just got her first #COVID19 #covidvaccine through @AusPublicHealth and the staff/volunteers were so incredibly nice and thoughtful throughout the whole process. Their warmth almost made standing in the icy rain bearable.
106107	@catturd2 Have they put these variants into the coronavirus vaccine? To keep it going around the world?
106644	@MeghanMcCain People just don’t understand how serious the coronavirus is until it hits their family. The question is why are we getting the vaccine? Trump created some of the problems. He didn’t wear a mask  for a long time. People need to stop criticizing you and do some research.
105419	"@Feldegast1 Flu is not caused by coronavirus famiy but influenza virus family.Other coronavirus can cause ""cold"" symptoms that are mild and therefore no need for vaccine.Each virus-vaccine dynamic is different depending on many factors. Many work great (polio/hepatitis) others not."
201764	Second Covid vaccine yesterday. No side effects. Feeling great. All teachers should be vaccinated before schools fully open. #vaccine #CovidVaccine #COVID19 #schoolsreopening
105660	Now that schools are closing for the year, one question is coming to mind. Are they going to require my kids to receive a COVID-19 vaccine before they're allowed back in? Ain't. Fucking. Happening!!!#Qanon
105499	@AKriesen @RichMuny @Yockle @GovMikeDeWine You'll never get rid of any Coronavirus. Keep taking those jabs, because now a third is coming and Fauci wants you blistered every 5 months. Logic days the jab isn't working!!
105320	@kylenabecker @newsmax The only 100% effective VACCINE against the Pandemic is to get rid of all the tyrants of the coronavirus #COVID and put them in permanent Quarantine in maximum security prisons.
106509	UNICEF asking for vaccine for countries like India,where have you got us Mr.Modi!The whole world is seeing how weak we are,why were you touting yourself as vaccine guru!
106524	@mofosyne @GVDBossche @WHO Why are three nursing homes in Devon all suffering from COVID19 residents and staff effective this week.  Nearly all have rec’s their first vaccine.  This is happening in other countries as well.
106773	@MontgomeryCoMD Here's the #COVID19 vaccine update for MoCo: There isn't any vaccine for you.  And because we're going to vaccinate people who work here, even if they don't live here, you might never get vaccinated.  LOL.
105952	exactly. what y’all gotta say now? it’s YOUR CHOICE but i HIGHLY recommend getting the vaccine not only to protect you but someone you love as well. be smart.
107536	Now everyone with the vaccine is a carrier.  Good job, libs, while Pelosi holds huge conference with no masks or distancing.  Hypocrites all the way!!!
105677	The vaccine doesn't work but the most important thing is that there is no virus cause it's never been isolated so no vaccine needed at all
106290	Instead of forcing people to get a random shot, how about we realize how corrupt our govt is that they would release a virus on the world simply because they hate Trump and love power. #coronavirus #CovidVaccine #chinavirus #DoNotComply #democraps #NotMyPresident #Trump2024
106843	I’ve decided not to get my hair did or my nails done. I’m not dining out until #Colorado is where scientists tells us we need to be with testing (152/100K), tracing etc. A vaccine is at least 1 year away. Please #StayHome #DoYourPartCo #COVID19 @GovofCO
106521	@VinGuptaMD I'd like to know (esp in respect to the immune system), approx number of those who died of covid19 had not had a flu shot in the autumn. Pneumonia vaccines, esp for the elderly? Flu shots come out in September now, and even w/out Covid in them, they help me resist flu
105473	Totally agreed. Testing is the only way out! The WHO has said that even previous infection wont protect you from reinfection, which means even if a vaccine comes, it may only prevent serious infections and not an infection itself.
105816	If the #Government has such faith in these vaccines, why don't they take it first?  #askingforafriend #covid #vaccine #Pfizer #lawthelpus
107210	@AliciaVPP @richardzussman The ONLY oeople in BC who can not get the COVID19 vaccine are;Children under 5 years old.  And that may change very soon, sndPeople who have VALID MEDICAL reasons.Otherwise, there is not a person in this province, or Canada who wants a vaccine who can not access the vaccine
107280	There was always going to be a Christmas lockdown, if you didn't see it coming then bleh. Governments still working on case numbers not deaths. This will continue until you realise what is actually happening. If vaccines don't stop lockdowns what will ? #Covid_19 #COVID19
106180	Anti-Vaxxers think a Flu Shot will give your child Autism... but are lining up right now to give their whole family the COVID-19 vaccine if Trump endorses it.I'm starting to think their thought process isn't based on science... or research... or sense.
107416	CORONAVIRUS Pandemic at the Level  World and in my National Country and I think I have a positive result regarding a very feasible cure and Vaccine immediately to start fighting the Sar Cov -2 virusunfortunately in our COUNTRY President Andrés Manuel López Obrador does not 2/6
105912	The kicker is that they haven't actually isolated any virus. So what's this vaccine supposed to do exactly? @sjgarvey
105784	Who’s actually gonna have the coronavirus vaccine if they ever find one? I’d be very worried about what they’re actually putting in that shit
107052	What is really in the jab that we all must have it even though we don't need it? Is it sterilisation, a cull, or just a psyop to bring in digital ID cards and social credit?
107510	@MattHancock the whole country is laughing at you. Most don't believe your virus lies, the rest just think you are incompetent. And we have news for you... nobody is going to abide by any restrictions currently or upcoming and we are certainly not being vaxxed #SackMattHancock
106494	@First_class18 @CAgovernor @GavinNewsom @CAPublicHealth @CHHSAgency @Cal_OES @CAStateParks @CalVolunteers @ListosCA COVID-19 mutates rapidly, if there is a vaccine, it only works for short terms. COVID19 isn't going away easily but changes in our behavior can prevent it or manage it if we have it. Other countries can do it...why not the US, too much freedom, opinion, laziness or stupidity?
105657	@Spacedementia87 @davidwhitaker40 @mountainecology @10DowningStreet 1) Do you genuinely believe 100,000 people signed up as volunteers? 2) it usually takes 12-15 years minimum to get a vaccine approved?3) no institute has found a coronavirus vaccine in 20/25 years yet we do in 6 months? Sorry it’s 98.54% in the U.K. think that’s high enough
106383	How did healthy, under-65, non-healthcare-workers family got COVID-19 vaccine so soon? They got a tip and used it. Didn't contact any compromised or elderly people or healthcare workers in their family, friend group, neighborhood, kids school.
107071	@NBCLX My great grandma in Newburgh NY got the vaccine, fell broke her hip, and contracted coronavirus/ COVID19 at the physical therapy clinic. YOU TELL ME HOW EFFECTIVE THIS VACCINE IS WHEN THE POEPLE AROUND ME ARE STILL GETTING BADLY SICK 💔
105464	What q shame this this, meanwhile countries around the world have noneThis reminds me like the gun issue, when there is a mass shooting like at a school, outrage abound and after a month everyone forgets and carry on, vaccines are like a news cycle, human behaviour is weird
107117	Has there been any forgery of the COVID-19 vaccine cards? Or is that not an issue yet as they're not yet widely the permission slip back into normal activities?
105665	All those who died of Covid got the flu vaccine this year. Is it because they had compromised immune systems?Or is it something more sinister? All nursing home patients get vaccinated. Why did 5 Dem govs keep Covid patients in nursing homes? 🤔#Plandemic #ArrestBillGates
106616	It's 2021 there is a vaccine for coronavirus, DeSantis is impeached, and an executive order is signed to replace the mile to mandatory participation in Kanye's New Workout Plan
107601	@CollignonPeter In Italy I learn about twenty, thirty and forty year olds who lose their lives due to covid19. I would really like to know if the disease is really cured as they say or if it is fatal. I am not interested in ideologies. The only way to save is the vaccine yes or no?
105763	@daverich503 @english_poet @PamSeaside123 @Dirka4TRUMP @flynsue1 @sandmanblue2 @michaeljohns @freedmfiter1 @robert_crosby20 @454US @KathiCupidsmom @Shelbycobra642 @mspdcali @Dago70_2 @LaReginaNYFL @TwinBus @AlexH1717 @PAF1st Microsoft conspire to unleash COVID-19, but they’re also going to step in with the “cure”. They’ll have a hand in a vaccine that everyone will willfully take to be rid of coronavirus fears, but it will secretly microchip them, allowing Gates and Co. to track everyone.
107349	Over the last few months, if asked whether I would receive a coronavirus vaccine, my reaction has been yes. But then, I've thought...well, that depends. It depends on what we hear about this vaccine, the approval process, etc. News like this is good to see.
106423	@XylariaVG purposefully inject this man with coronavirus, and tell him he can only get the vaccine if he delivers on these promises
107414	"@thehill ""...the Democrats don't want a vaccine either! They want Americans to die from the Coronavirus!! Not like me, when I ignored it for months, and called it a Democra... oh shit, forget that!"""
201625	All well-informed people know that this is possible - significant protection only *starts* 12 days after the first vaccine dose. The well-known 95% effective rate is only some time after the *second* dose. My reaction to this and news of a few allergic reactions: who cares?
106307	My only regret about getting 2nd COVID-19 vaccine shot is I went there a lil early, so instead of having an excuse to get a nice sandwich for lunch at a place I like near there, I got a dynamite omelet earlier instead.Also I’m not yet functioning very well as a 5G cell tower.
107132	If the vaccine works then those the want to be protect it OK and my refusal should not matter because those that worried are safe. does this answer your question
105435	So only two outcomes from #COVID19 1Vaccine 2You're antibody test proves your body can fight the virus. Going out is a risk we cant gamble with, the vaccine is risk I will not be so comfortable with accepting. Question everything. #coronavirus
201636	@shiftms Rest,rest and more rest!!! My fatigue has been pretty extreme the last couple of days! And if I didn’t have to get my 1st Covid-19 vaccine tomorrow, I would stay in bed all day! But I am so fortunate to be able to get this vaccine I will crawl to the Doctors office to get it!
106884	@steveubl When you actually come up with a vaccine for the common cold (which is a coronavirus) maybe I'll possibly slightly remotely consider getting a cv-19 vaccine
201541	I just got my first shot of the Pfizer vaccine today at State Farm Stadium. They have an excellent system working there. Hurray!!! 🎊🎉💉
105939	@charliekirk11 Anti vaccine a-holes are going to be why we don’t beat COVID-19 when we currently have the resources to do so.
105787	@AaronBosterMD @YouTube Thank you for posting. I will be telling my doctors when I get vaccinated, but are there projects ongoing to track MS patients and COVID-19 or vaccines? I'm signed up with Narcoms study, will have my 2nd yearly follow up in 3 months. Any others we should look for?
105886	So, basically, the jab might not actually do much except protect people who don't need protecting and Covid is mainly affecting people with preexisting conditions, like we've known for 18 months now. If this is true then many people are going to jail for a £1 trillion fraud
105265	Not surprising. He's in with Gates' NWO POPULATION CONTROL VACCINE SCAM. Killing people like the elderly in the Nursing homes is  in their wheelhouse
106766	What will parents do if the government mandates the COVID-19 vaccine for children returning to school.  I bet it would create the biggest uproar in history.  Nearly 5000 people have DIED after taking this vaccine.  One kid does and it is game over.
107409	@larssivertsen And he’s been getting into anti-vaccine David Icke, 5g coronavirus conspiracy nonsense recently, so he’s seemingly only getting less intelligent
105273	My mom received the vaccine the day it became available in Virginia. She’s a respiratory therapist. Even as a teacher, I don’t need this vaccine to do my job at the moment.
107550	people would probably take a vaccine for the wuhan virus yet not for the flu. People are so so strange
105881	@oOoMzPiinkoOo @VLEXXXGALINDO That’s a very wrong and dangerous mentality. The coronavirus, yes has been around for awhile but the particular strain HAS NOT. Hence why there is no vaccine or cure for it, therefore we MUST take precautions and STAY home to prevent further spread. Stop underestimating it.
107564	This virus is spreading way too rapidly. Can anyone reply to this tweet with any databases on the infection? #coronavirus #coronavaccine
107579	@realDonaldTrump I wasn’t allowed to say anything until today, but it's now done so.... I volunteered for the test phase of COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer. This vaccine is the one that has been developed in Russia. It is administered in 6 different stages and I received my first...
107272	@KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Somebody needs to tell Rand Paul to take a flying leap.  He isn't a doctor, he isn't a scientist so he has no business telling people not wear masks if they've had Covid-19 or if you had the vaccine.  Let the doctors and scientist do their job. They don't try and do yours
107661	2 weeks after the election, Moderna announces their vaccine is 95% effective. How long did they know? How long did they delay the announcement to hurt @realDonaldTrump just like Pfizer? I bet Tony Fauci knows. These are his pals. Proof that Big Pharma doesn't care about YOU.
201716	148,000 Nigerians have so far received their second dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. — @drfaisalshuaib (June 3, 2021)
106222	@ianbrown The vaccines for various coronavirus types such as seasonal flu and CV19 are similar. Never any evidence or reason to think that they can cause infertility.
105868	@discipleheart1 It's not what I think it's what I know. This is not a fully approved vaccine, we are going through phase 2 and 3 using the American population. As they push the 'safe' vaccine relentlessly on doctor radio in the same breath they tell us they know very little about covid19
106014	#Unvaccinated #vaccine #vaccinated #VaccinePassports #Covid_19 #coronavirus #VaccineMandate This is why- because the 2 shot vaccine did its job- (people can't think for themselves- they will do what they are told) this is a side effect from the vaccine #VaccineSideEffects
105584	@AdamBode4 @MsMelChen @PeterDrew There has never been a successful coronavirus vaccine in 50+ years of research specifically because they mutate so much--using non-sterilizing treatments in mass only drives mutants thru selective pressure and will lead to immune escape.  Vax the elderly/immune compromised.
106999	This is what #JoeBiden doesn't say about the vaccine....that people are still getting the #coronavirus even after getting the vaccine.
201512	Sorry my body is a temple of the Lord's..it is not mine...Thus taking a #vaccine goes against my #Christian values...I also can't believe or spread a lielike covid and it's numbers#wakeup#WakeUpAmerica
107432	@RichmondWahoo @diogeron @NewsHour James covid-19 IS SARS-COV-2. It was called that bc it is similar (not the same) to SARS-COV. It's a new virus that belongs to the coronavirus fam. The vaccines work so well bc they were created using existing techniques for covid-19. You take YOUR misinformation out of here.
106333	absolutely blows my mind that there are people in my family who are proud about deciding not to get the covid-19 vaccine
107320	What we need is a vaccine against COVID-19 cause we are going to be living with this shit. And the sad thing is everyone is going to get this shit one way or the other sighs 🤦🏽‍♂️
105259	How can you find a business for not being able to use all of their COVID vaccine? Maybe people just don’t want it?Or are they desperate for us to get it?
107031	@Lancegooden Lance Gooden,You are going to cry regardless if it is too high or low.America is having problems because of the Covid-19 variant is causing manning shortages throughout the United States. 🇺🇸 It would nice 👍 if all Americans would get the Covid vaccine without being told.
107543	@WilliamPesek The whole world is going down with vaccines or not. Covid-19 will become endemic, and we can't stop it.
105249	"@koreatimescokr *new* Coronavirus? So, it's #Covid20 in #Korea ? Not ""re-infected"" but ""re-activated"". Does the virus lay dormant then re-activate, until a vaccine is found to kill it? @WHO @normanswan #FactCheck"
107022	@PheenixRiseeng Quick question, if I die from coronavirus will it protect me against getting cancer 🤷‍♀️PS. I got cancer way before I got my vaccine so I’m not sure who’s winning here but I think it’s not your SiL 😬😆
107260	Why are so many people without a mask on and there is no vaccine omg I’m gonna catch Coronavirus I just know it and if I have to die a painful death because of you bitches I’m coming back haunting you with a vengeance
106187	I live in PA; am 74.  My grandchildren who attend school in person, live with us. My husband is 77.  He works outside the home. we have no idea when we will get the vaccine.  Communication from health services is sorely lacking.  Friends all over the country have received theirs!
106003	No way is this clown getting that vaccine. They're trying really hard to convince us these vaccines are safe. I've never seen him with a mask on. Is it really even  him? And why turn off the replies?
201550	Had my 2nd vaccine. Sore heavy arm. Bit cold n shaky, icy toes, hot face. Just uncomfy. Better than Covid 19!Took 2 paracetamol (Tylenol).  Worked a treat.A public service announcement.Have the vaccine.Paracetamol is a fab drug in the right circumstances#vaccine #COVID19
106046	Y’all wanna encourage Americans to get the #Covid19 #Vaccine? Then stop showing me @marcorubio getting the vaccine and start showing me @DollyParton getting it. She deserves it before anyone else.

107265	@cassie_thehuman @Vasownboss @RepMaryFranson @RepThomasMassie Because it’s not mandatory! No one give 2 pennies if you get a flu shot, but I can’t participate fully in society without the Covid-19 vaccine. It’s not the same. I never get the flu shot for the record.
106648	Keep doing good work @GautamGambhir.... And...to clarify, he is not procuring #COVID19 #vaccine. He is going to pay hospitals and arrange it for common citizens.
106804	It's tactical. So are the premature state openings. They are gambling that Biden will be successful with the vaccine- they will then pivot, point to the early openings, and claim the stimulus was an unneeded massive addition to the deficit. They will do this. It's who they are.

107488	@apoorva_nyc It is a Novel Coronavirus originated from animals &amp; nobody is immune to it. Kids aren't affected that much but they can spread it to others.Definitely not a man-made virus.Masks,hand-hygiene &amp; social distancing can prevent it.Can get proper immunity only through a vaccine.
106816	@svallers @droverdriver61 Also they were working on the vaccines before covid, this isn't our first coronavirus.
107381	SCIENTISTS got us the COVID19 vaccine...Trump can't make the vaccine. Trump is not a scientist. Simply put...   .... you can make all the calls you want, but without the scientists and the science...there would be NO vaccines.

106783	@JCavallo972 @fcraska30 @HotlineJosh Real question for you. If he already had COVID19 why get the shot? And not just a booster later on like we may need?

107104	@Teensthack Indian vaccine is completely safe and above 80% efficacy. We don't need other countries vaccine. E.U trying hard to sell their vaccine. Hence stoping indian vaccine. Everything business. US China's big top companies and vaccine sellers both are behind this covid19 spread.
106206	@commonsnspoli @CNN Covid 19, like any other coronavirus can never go away until herd immunity achieved. Period. That’s it. Please educate yourself. No deadly virus has ever gone away without herd immunity and/or a vaccine, or drastic mutation to bring less deadly.
105207	Vaccines are helping us all get our lives back, but I've seen all sorts of misinformation since they've become available. Confronting fear with facts is how we overcome vaccine hesitancy. Dr. Walensky has the answers to your questions about the COVID vaccine ⬇

106588	If there is any institutions to look up to before taking the vaccine, not this dishonest and incompetent EC chairperson and her vice..
106672	Check out the hard work of our @CFMSFEMC Govt Affairs Rapid Response Task Force! The team will be compiling information for medical students to help keep us up to date on news and progress on the COVID-19 vaccine 🇨🇦❤️
105789	@RealCandaceO The contagiousness is very likely to compel, although you think if one is already vaccinated, then why should 1 care if the other is not? How effective are the #COVID19 vaccines?
105794	@realDonaldTrump @SarahHuckabee @Bill19293640 @DrJudyAMikovits Someone please get the truth out!! This Dr. Judy Mikovits is NOT a quack!! Why in the world is Dr. Fauci not in jail?? #VaccineAgenda #COVIDー19 #DrFauci #DrJudyMikovits #GatesForPrison2020 #NoVaccine
107456	THREE PRESIDENTS QUEUING FOR A VACCINE THAT DOESN'T WORK AND PROBABLY DOESN'T EXIST THEY ARE NOT SOCIAL DISTANCING AND NOT WEARING FACE MASKS AND THE PHOTO IS ALMOST CERTAINLY A FAKE THAT'S WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM BBC TV NEWS TODAY  IT IS PURELY TRIPE MY FRIENDS AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE
106084	Africans forced to take COVID-19 vaccine, but the ebola brought by the invaders to my kindred does not deserve a vaccine.
201784	So, has anyone gotten their third #Moderna (booster) #COVID19 vaccine yet? I’m itching to get mine BEFORE we travel next week.#GetVaccinated I’m not over 65 or immunocompromised, but I do work in healthcare and travel a lot for work. I got my second dose in early Feb ‘21.
107152	@poiThePoi @jonst0kes Sure. Long odds, probably. Though I worry that this is the first time we tried a coronavirus vaccine - and we did it in a rush. Why was there no vaccine after SARS or MERS?
201643	DONE with my pneumonia vaccine today. And THANK YOU so much to my hub for the generousity. I only have 3 tablets (Isoniazid) left and can't dropby sa pharmacy. They gave me 30 tablets to complete my 6months TB prophylaxis. This is another thing removed from having to worry today. https://t.co/hNWoi0qeKN
201775	SO thankful…I got my booster today!!! 🦠💉😷 #VaccinesSaveLives #COVID19 #VaccinesWork #GetVaccinated #VAXXED
105278	@PressSec Why can’t the government force Moderna to share their Covid-19 vaccine formula with the world for free/low cost? The government paid for the development!
201769	Had my first covid vaccine today at 3.55pm so far no reaction let's pray it stays that way #COVID19 #astrazenecavaccine
105365	I for one am looking forward to my coronavirus vacation, 💉however with the new changes do I still have to take care for the whole twelve weeks before my second Jab 💉, I was OK. Waiting three weeks as happy to even isolate now confused 😕 do I isolate for three months😷💉⚕️
106224	Pretty much this. Considering recent finds, I'm pretty optimistic on a coronavirus vaccine. That said, I don't think it'll be very effective, we'll probably need multiple doses, and I'm not sure everyone will be able to get one (children or the old may have immune issues).
201709	I don’t feel well, my upper arm is very sore and hot. I have a neck-ache and headache, taken some paracetamol. #covid19 #vaccine
105646	1. I am not taking your experimental vaccine.2. I don't own a spy and tracking device ( phone ) so good luck with this.3. You're a liar.
105918	@DaniBat Oh just the fact that the hemp plants / marijuana were studied long before the COVID-19 vaccines were ever thought of. Then again, I get how you may not know that when you’re a delusional leftist who doesn’t live in reality. #1984
107020	@WayneDupreeShow Hell no. If we can get a coronavirus vaccine in a year why isn't there one for SARS or MERS yet?
106021	Not unless there is a variant that both enjoys heat and is impervious to the vaccine.Are we still listenng to Imperial? And what figure did they quote?
105595	Kind of figured that the project would be delayed. They're still using the old Macy's as a central vaccine/testing site in the city. Nothing's going to happen until they get a new, permanent solution to those needs.
201634	I got my first COVID-19 vaccine today. I nearly cried from relief when the nurse injected me. #FauciOuchie #Moderna #thankyouJesusandDollyParton #theonlycoronaiwantisbeer
107211	@Dan_GT2 They would soon get the shot. I think after all of this everyone who wants to experience things need to have a vaccination card for Covid-19 to do things. No vaccine your going to have a rough time like let's say flying, getting into certain places where crowds are big and close.
201704	"""Stop with the hero stuff. I'm afraid""Afraid for my family, my friends, my residents, for myself... I cant wait for the vaccineExcellent writing @blackishabc  👏👏👏👏👏👏"
107128	@Testing123Tes18 @GovRonDuhSantis @TannerHart @laurenboebert I still don't understand how or why Hopkins developing their own vaccine has *anything* to do with their ability to judge other vaccine safety! Can you explain??? Why is Hopkins article on Covid19 vaccine safety not valid?? Don't assume. Provide evidence!
105323	I'm going to get the Covid19 jab because of the intent if the budget allows it to take a product interstate and possibly overseas to then market.Otherwise I would not consider the Jab because how I feel. I can hide how I feel, but I can't nessicary control how I feel.
107469	So this is why Xeno_ offered to buy @grehpo a beer, while simultaneously trying to put a cone around my head.Trying to trick me into getting the vaccine, eh?
106950	Considering these vaccines will have very unpleasant side effects, I think this is an excellent idea.
107070	@Aflame4Truth So just let the elderly die if COVID-19 than risk a probably safe vaccine. You apparently don’t have an over 70 loved one.  In the over 5% mortality crowd the benefits far outweigh any known risks. Decisions out of fear rarely work out well. Don’t give it to under 40 crowd.
107351	We all need to work together to protect the world from #COVID19 and the May 4 pledging conference must be a success. Will @g20org states please step up and release much needed funds for response efforts to @WHO @CEPIvaccines and @gavi? Together, we can beat this pandemic.
106420	As someone in a vulnerable population who’s trying to self-isolate until there’s a vaccine, let me just say you couldn’t pay me enough to get this one.
107005	@BobSteele55 You have waited this long Bob due to covid-19 so another week is nothing you will smash it m8.The vaccine is now opening up all operations andci notice my oncology unit getting a lot busier which is brilliant.👍👍🙏🙏🙏🙏🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
107168	I’m all about people choosing what they want but if you choose to not get the vaccine please don’t let the reason be because HE said not to 😂😂😂
107198	"SO @realDonaldTrump WE REALLY NEED FOR THE FAUSI AND Birx AND ALL WHO HAS A STAKE IN THE ""VACCINES/ TREATMENTS/MASK"" NEED TO PUBLICLY EXPLAIN THIS BULL B/C WE'RE SICK BEING PLAYED LIKE CHESS PIECES. WE DON'T TRUST ANY ONE IN GOVERNMENT OR THE MEDICAL PROFESSION."
106971	@JennyGerrard4 @Luan89310204 @RapoportAnatoli @KayaJones And the milllions and millions who ALREADY had Covid-19 will never get Covid-19 again.   Their bodies made their own antibodies against Covid-191000% better than any vaccine! They can’t get it again therefore, cannot spread it!
107230	@davidicke Simple, because people get infected by flu again and again year after year and flu vaccine has to be taken every year then any #coronavirus vaccine will not be a once in a life time vaccine but a yearly vaccine just as the case with flu.
107572	And How Would You Stop a Pandemic From Spreading . When The People Are To Selfish And Stupid To Do The Right Thing Like NSW. Victoria Had It BeatOur Brain Dead PM has Disappeared as Usual.With No Vaccine Ordered.?
105615	They will milk everyone that has taken those vaccines for life.You all will keep renewing shots every year. 😂
106191	@cnn The world is still waiting for a vaccine for other viruses with no cure like HIV and HSV...how is COVID-19 any different? And how optimistic is the development of this vaccine? #CNNTownHall
106022	COVID-19 vaccine I wanted to get it right away. I would argue and argue with my mother and beg her to let me get vaccinated, but she kept on saying no. Later to find out why I wouldn’t be getting to vaccine because of my arthritis. My mother had talked to my doctor and they said
106243	@cafe_health I predicted politicians such as Governors would start trying to prove that the coronavirus vaccine is safe by having saline injected. There's no way in hell they are really getting a vaccine
105254	@DrOtterman Flu is 40-60% and typhoid for another eg is 72%However there is precedent with other vaccines, such as Polio, Smallpox (eliminated) Measles, Mumps, Rubella (97% effective)We know this Coronavirus is different from one which causes flu so that could be why it's more effective
106612	@toxdom I can't think of any coronavirus vaccines, but there may be some. However, an antibody is super specific. If you tested another coronavirus vaccine against CV-19, it would not be able to help show efficacy. It's like having 2 gold keys, each will only fit the lock it belongs to.
106799	Our very own Dr. Greenberg discussing a Dermatologic reaction to the Covid vaccine- if you think you have a post vaccine reach out- info@lvderm.com #dermatology #vegas #drvegas
201678	In addition, I electronically contacted the usual local ‘county’ COVID-19 vaccine medical delivery providers...My actual COVID-19 vaccine scheduling question is this;If (as an individual), I have to concurrently ‘register’ with a distributed (50) vaccine provider resources.
201695	Fully vaxxed and back in the office. Feeling a bit like a feral child raised by wolves reintroduced to civilization and Eliza Doolittle with a bunch of rocks in my mouth.#COVID19
201589	Second Covid19 vaccine done. I also died my hair red on guidance from my five year old https://t.co/Qk2rfeU6qI
105488	Serious question and bit of conspiracy theory -  what if there is something in the vaccine that will prevent exposure to the next virus they are planning?  What if not taking the vaccine exposes us to something worse?
105276	I’m so confused how it’s not clear that the vaccine isn’t the answer omg haha how is this supposed to make you get it???
106120	My liberal friends are often asking “Why did we get vaxxed? We are still getting it and passing it and it’s MORPHING and we are all miserable.” Coronavirus has better survival instincts than modern man.
105537	@CNN If successful, this will be the first successful coronavirus vaccine in the sixty years since coronaviruses were found in humans.
106473	"So Astra Zeneca is only revealing what "" they think""  happened in their #COVID19 vaccine, stopping volunteer human clinical trials.  Well it's pretty serious  👉 Transverse myelitis interrupts the messages that the spinal cord nerves send throughout the body.👈"
107113	Where does he think the work force is going to come from if these people don’t get their jabs? What a fucking cock. #RIPNHS
106262	@karynmaughan Lockdown does not kill the virus. It is going to run its cause anyway. After years and years, still no vaccine for any coronavirus exist. Self-quarantine and let the rest work.
106303	In fact, there is no guarantee that we will be able to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus in the immediate future.#کام_کو_چلو_کورونا_سے_بچو
201582	"I am so glad Eubi!  So glad. I hope when we are old and rich, we will laugh about how we had Covid19 at the same time. My symptoms were SO mild, it felt more like a ""sneezing fit."" Thanks to vaccine I took whilst travelling a few weeks prior. But for you, timing was everything!👏"
106678	If it was actually a vaccine it would kill the virus and prevent future illness,  but it doesn't so it's just a treatment option?
107671	@NishiwakiRina #unpeconJapan should be able to get the vaccine not only by doctors but also by volunteers like the United Kingdom.  If this happens, the vaccine intake rate will increase, and the tourism industry will become as active as it did before the coronavirus.
106169	@kimmibaby1989 @Josiestweet Really don’t get why post articles like this as reason not to get the vaccine. Millions have died from getting coronavirus, yet you focus on the two articles you can find of people dying after having the vaccine? Millions of deaths vs. a few deaths, tough call for sure ⚖️🙄
107526	@pfizer and @moderna_tx Anti-Vaxers. Once distribution of the covid-19 vaccine gets distributed. You get a free airline ticket to North Dokota where they literally... and I’m not joking elected a dead person as their representative.
106778	Sounds like this school probably doesn’t mandate wearing masks. But the vaccine harms those who are “in close proximity”. 🤨
106847	@DrHugoA @MHRAgovuk @RBandH @ImperialNHLI @bengoldacre @DoctorChristian @doctor_oxford @DrRayBakes @drphilhammond @xandvt @DoctorChrisVT @drphiliplee1 @mgtmccartney I will take any approved coronavirus vaccine.I'm not a doctor but 3 of my children are.I'm a lawyer. I trust the science.
106097	crazy this is why we listen to scientists.. but also they could’ve stopped it they knew it was mutating and no one thought hey maybe this needs a vaccine
105664	@jonatanpallesen Gates is OK to me but why the focus on him? Aside from the Coronavirus vaccine conspiracy stuff then he is a pretty typical misguided philanthropist.
106360	▶️China has made key progress in scientific research. To date, four inactivated vaccines and one adenovirus vaccine have been approved for clinical trials. ▶️Once Covid-19 vaccine is developed and deployed in China, it will be used as a global public product.
105666	So let me get this straight. Fact: Bill wants to depop the world. He is creating a vaccine and wants to give it to Black Americans first? Black Americans are leaving the Dems in droves. What a convenient way to get rid of the problem...
106413	@TerraB717 Covid-19 and all their vaccines are nothing but poison to American citizens if you are Muslim you don't have to get the shot I am Muslim today I'm not getting a shot!!🇺🇸
106837	How about a holiday in #EUROPE? Or the #EC part of it, once they've got the #Covid19 Vaccine sent out to all countries. Still squabbling like Le Rats dans le Sac.   #bbcAQ
106393	what if bill gates is turning everyone into 5g towers with the coronavirus vaccine that george soros is paying for
201757	My dad had his first Covid-19 jab today. It feels a little like the light at the end of the tunnel is drawing a bit closer. https://t.co/9pwMNtY8uH
107633	Greater then 70 percent population is vaccinated they check vaccine passes  in all taxi restaurants attractions Time with peace This is the way #COVID19
106149	@ProviderOfTruth @archdelux1 @NPR_junky @CNN This is a new strain just like you said. There’s no vaccine and scientists don’t even know much about the virus. Just because it’s on a Lysol can has nothing to do with what we know and how we handle it. Nobody’s ever had Covid-19 until it hit downplaying it doesn’t make it leave
105718	The vaccine should be tested on politicians first. If they survive, the vaccine is safe. If they don't, then the country is safe.#covid19
106034	Lagos is still topping the CORONAVIRUS League. The super four LAGOS, GOMBE, OYO and DELTA will enter CHAMPIONSHIP LEAGUE FINAL. Besides, where is KANO in this list? 42,922 cases discharged without any vaccine. How and what treatment did they take? #COVID19Nigeria is a hoax
106578	@JohnCLibert5 @washingtonpost Ron is not requiring you to fear evil but when you don’t get a bed space in the ICU, you would realize then that you’re lost in the  valley of Covid-19 with no ladder (vaccine) to get out
105490	@JustinTrudeau Tested positive for #COVID19 after 3 jabs!  Really? You think everyone is rushing to get their #vaccines now?  You sure are stupid.  Another excuse to not deal with the #TruckersConvoy2022 That’s ok, they’ll wait for you!
105509	Y’all realize the common cold is a coronavirus? And there is no cure or vaccination for it? So don’t get your hopes up about a cure or vaccine.
105842	@realDonaldTrump The only thing u ever did for vaccines is say, “We should develop a vaccine.”  You thought “a solid flu vaccine” would prevent Coronavirus.
105354	The WHO is responsible for covering up the discovery that virus = exosome. They shut down proffessor Duesberg and Kary Mullis for it. They tampered with research to be able to use poison in vaccine on all like done in 1918 by Frederick T Gates !
107497	#HistroicalArchive  #covid19 I don't even know where the herd immunity carp started with this virus. We use the term for vaccines but never illness itself. Plus you can get #coronavirus more than once so it's pointless anyway. Not to mention unethical.
106945	Dear Fox PunditsThe vaccine was developed based on the 1st Covid-19 not the mutations since. So it’s efficacy will obviously be lower. We should be grateful it’s as good as it is. But keep spewing garbage so we get a vaccine resistant strain and do it all over againK thx
106750	@Daring_Idiot @NeilSheesley @andyd522 @DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump So it is ok for the idiot to call it the china virus?  Kind of two way on that one.  We are all aware it is the covid 19 and that the vaccine was done quickly because they had the laywork already done for the coronavirus.  Not because the orange baffoon did anything.
105277	On day one of the #MorrisonLockdown, Victoria does itself proud with amazing testing numbers!And vaccination numbers are up, too! Go you beauty, because this is how we not just trample the virus, but stamp it out! If you can, please organise your jab.#COVID19Vic #COVID19Aus
105408	Ndp on #cp24 telling everyone this new variant is extremely contagious and deadly .... same channel , doctors telling us “we don’t know enough” lockdown for Xmas people. How’s that vaccine working out for ya ? #covid19
201675	Guess who just booked the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine??!!! Tomorrow at 9:30 ... I'm getting the shot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
107518	@ChuckCallesto I feel we will be forced to take the Covid-19 vaccine for everyone’s benefit just like we are being forced to wear masks for everyone’s benefit.
105426	There have been many attempts to make viral vaccines in the past that ended in utter failure, which is why we did not have a coronavirus vaccine in 2020.  In the 1960's, scientists attempted to make an RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) vaccine for infants.
107202	@SiberiaCat3 @Moonie74786922 @centexgrunt @Kelly_K_77 @SquirrelOS @lavern_spicer Not a bot - just reality. Covid-19 will not disappear, even with 100% vaccinations. Plus, no way will 100% be global, and the vaxxed catch/carry. Learning to live with endemic is possible. Figuring out how isn’t being openly discussed. Fearing the pandemic is not productive.
107127	@sechsneuneins @FaheemYounus So why has this methodology not been applied to a vaccine for treating AIDS ,SARS, MERS all viruses,  as deadly, if these hv been proven safe in less then 12 months of testing? AIDS been around 40 years , SARS 19. Covid19, 1 year &amp; there is a fix using a method not deployed b4.
107209	@patriotchick4 @knoone413 @AmirAminiMD This was a, get this, NOVEL coronavirus. There was no way to fight it because it is not the same strain as similar viruses. It is A coronavirus. Not SARS-CoV-2. Which is also why new tests had to be made and there's no vaccine.
105957	@TheM_L_G @ACiderDrink There is a very real drawback of socialized medicine countries they havent made any progress on a vaccine despite having earlier strains of the coronavirus sars being the prominent one which happened over 15 years ago
106092	@EmeraldRobinson whats it like lying about a Virus (COVID19) that has killed 700k Americans, and Lying about the Vaccine,, JUST SO YOU GET A PAY CHECK&lt; whats it like to be the FACE in the Dictionary next to the word Deplorable
106789	@newscomauHQ @mikepompeo How does a virus get from a #WuhanLab to being inside a human? #vaccines. The people of #china were given mandatory vaccines JUST before this all broke out. Then #5G was rolled out adding further #stress to the body and #coronavirus took over. #cellpoisoning💉⚡️#billgates #WHO
201528	40 mins away from having my covid vaccine .... 💪🏼 so scared of needles 😩😩 #COVID19 #CovidVaccine #letsdothis
105821	No really, I give up. I have been fighting to get the world to buy Prevnar and Pneumovax and HPV shots for a decade, and no one in #cdnpoli knew who the F Gavi or @ShotAtLife wasNow suddenly #covid19 comes along and you all know how vaccines get made, ordered and bought
201635	Back from my first Saturday evening out in ages. OK, I took Dad to the health centre for his first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, but it still counts.....
105390	Just because we've got a really good vaccine against polio doesn't mean the same thing will work with coronavirus, because it's so different.
106730	the vaccine against coronavirus is a fraud humanity will have to live with this virus what humanity needs and treatment to not die because with vaccine or without vaccine humanity is dying.
106963	The problem is people come around to wanting the vaccine only AFTER they get sick! Be smart, people! Get it now!!
105289	Morning after #COVID19  vaccine update:- My arm is hecka sore. Much like after the flu shot, I won't be lifting my arm up today.- My brain is foggy and I'm pretty tired. Going up the stairs is tiring and talking extensively is too.
105253	@99freemind @HRHospital There has never been a coronavirus vaccine that ever worked.  Suddenly we are sold two vaccines will save the world.
106043	I actually find nothing wrong with this. Dia cuma utamakan je, like they utamakan front liner. Kita punya turn dpt vaccine memang lambat lagi pun 😂In fact, these people helped SO SO SO many lives before. Dont you think they deserve it?
107361	@msnbc has made it abundantly clear. They do not care at all about people who die from taking the vaccine. @msnbc doesn't employ a single person who values human life.  What terrible human beings.
106861	@KobieThatcher @ShazzaCook @deanandy477 @NSWHealth ... and for the Nay sayer, coronavirus Arte known for not having a vaccine because we never found one against the common cold, however, why not now, why not since our research are becoming worldwide, why not now since it is our primarily focus?
107568	This whole thing, all of it, COVID, Vaccines, Republicans, Election, it is all one big cluster f’ck. I’m going to my corner of the world, done with it all, won’t watch news, I’m going to be one of those people who don’t know shit and are happy as can be. Republicans r a waste....
201526	The jab for #COVID19 is amazing but I’ve had this 24 hour sickness bug for the last 18 hours and don’t understand why we don’t have a jab for this! I feel awful!
107344	Random Saturday thought-it’s amazing to think we got a Covid19 vaccine developed, trialled and partially deployed quicker than the time it took Apple to figure out how to adapt Face ID so that we could unlock our phones whilst masked up 🤔🤔🤔#GetVaccinated
105705	COVID-19 is realMost will develop mild to no symptoms.However, those it does kill, it kills rather quicklyBeing obese is high risk for hospitalization and/or death.The vaccine is probably a good idea for such folks.
106905	@RitaLisaPatton @56Symons @JustinTrudeau @jacindaardern You are either a bot or a very stupid person.  There has never been a vaccine for a.coronavirus ever!  This is a flu bug with a 99.6% recovery rate.  Never a vaccine for SARS or H1N1, and we survived.  You take this vaccine and you will be in a graveyard.
107394	JKL the Kagwe Dilemma. @KoinangeJeff  @citizentvkenya  , In his own words, 'how is the Kenyan vaccine going to work? and how did they know that am going to get covid19? Ama unapewa vaccine na unatumwa penye corona iko?' Just asking.
107369	Feel like a train wreck after receiving my first Pfizer vaccine yesterday. Hopefully, these symptoms will subside quickly and won't be as bad the second time around! Just made me realise how much worse it may be actually contracting Covid19! #happilyvaccinated
106432	Just tell them the vaccine is weak ... Because I took the shot and the vaccine is weak .... You know how hArd it's to work now after COVID-19 ... My body feels like it's 50 I'm 27...I need a booster shot or new shots treatment .. cause it  weak ..it slow your thoughts down dat it
106163	Yeah but will those children be sterile or get cancer  autism, schizophrenia or autoimmune disease? This is a clinical trial on humans and now their offspring. There is no liability for the pharmaceutical companies and the vaccines aren't FDA approved. Still labeled experimental
105653	@IMHOjustsaying @SysOptSpeMike @BrianAckerman80 @POTUS Flu vaccines are required around the world? You may say why choose the flu vaccine, well that is because it is a yearly shot because the virus mutates, the same as the SARSCoV2 virus which is just a coronavirus.
201767	Super excited and relieved to be getting my first COVID-19 vaccine today. One down one more to go in three weeks. 💉 https://t.co/C7cvd0oOTX
105263	@theheraldsun Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
105232	Bottom line is, just get the fucking vaccine already so we can get this shit over with.  The QUICKER we can get back to NORMAL, the BETTER!This is honestly QUITE tiresome... 😠#COVID19 #Delta
107548	Plus I bet that when we do get a vaccine for Covid-19 the Anti-Vaxxers will be fighting the school districts if it’s required.

107560	what did y’all think would happen with the vaccine? it’s the same as a flu vaccine, you’ll still catch the virus, it just won’t affect you as bad as it would without it.

106070	@KBAndersen @Monte_Alto Trump wants to use the vaccine for the Coronavirus to blackmail the world population! 🇺🇸🦅👇@realDonaldTrump
105197	Oh, for Christ sake @CovidData2 #fact : Vaccines against pneumonia do not provide protection against the new coronavirus. #coronavirus #moronavirus
105742	@MickyArison Are you considering that people who already had covid get the vaccine too ? Are you aware the damage it does to the heart if you were already infected with Coronavirus  ?Or are you just droning the chant ?
106300	@UPP_Polls I'm worried that the normal flu vaccine is going to be targeted by antivaxxers when fall comes around, probably with claims that the coronavirus is in it or something.It's only going to get worse when the actual COVID-19 vaccines becomes viable.
106054	Bill gates has a patent on coronavirus. So all the research being done and any vaccine created, he will get royalty payments on. @RoninSamTripoli @luisjgomez @lexfridman @NickHintonn @HighersideChats @tconspiracyguys @daylyt30 @joerogan @TimJDillon
106553	Will the vaccine give you any protection? If you look at the data you would have to say yes. If you then ask will the vaccine keep you from getting the coronavirus? Well you would have to say no.
107527	@mjean2 An effective vaccine will protect someone who receives it by lowering the chance of getting COVID-19 if the person encounters the coronavirus. More important is whether the vaccine prevents serious illness, hospitalization and death.
201518	WELL, I am microchipped jk lol but today I was fortunate enough to get the first dose of the Moderna COVID19 vaccineI believe and trust science. In the spirit of full transparency and honesty I will happily answer questions and post if I develop any side effects etc https://t.co/cVc2tnRZsT
107275	"So are we just assuming the Delta variant ceased to exist and those hospitalizations dont matter? This is easily the most aggressive vaccine ad campaign in history. Imagine if the Govt canceled aids treatment because it distributed condoms for Trojan. ""WRAP IT UP OR DIE"" -potus"
201630	@TomTSEC Just like the @CPofCN hoarding the #COVID19bioweapon vaccine from 🇨🇦 even though we collaborated with 🇨🇳 on it, China protects itself first.Funny the CCP ARMY been enjoying the vaccine for 2 months now while India's soliders are fighting #COVID19 and 🇨🇳 at the same time.
106168	This is actually investing advice now. So um... Even though the #SARSCoV2 vaccines from all these vaccine companies and shitty, you should invest in all these vaccine companies in the long term.COVID-19 causes immune amnesia.
106590	Better to go an vaccinated them. They will never maintain Covid appropriate behavior. My domestic help just took a Covid vaccine after so much of persuading. All her slum walas said you will die if you take vaccine.
106321	I will never get over how people are in public not wearing masks and planning parties and going to bars when coronavirus is still a thing and there is no vaccine and not enough testing.
107434	What's the point of the vaccine then if masks are needed? If symptoms show then the vaccine has failed.
106785	@thereds8 I'm a BIG vax supporter but, there is no vaccine ever going to be available for a 'coronavirus'. Our immune system will only build antibodies against it, for, on average, 6 mths.
106332	@SoCalValleyGal @ChytilTonia @charliekirk11 False equivalency when there is testing, vaccine, and an immunity pool to the flu. Look at another Coronavirus mutation like MERS or SARS.
105689	@bridgebum826 @sarahbeth345 I think there actually is a coronavirus vaccine for pets. My dogs haven't received it. They also didn't catch COVID from us when we had it.
105293	@Neoavatara Human beings just do not develop long term immunity to coronaviruses.  No mammals do.  Even canine coronavirus vaccine must be given every year.
107017	Good for Dr. Tedros! #Africa will not be a testing ground for #COVID19 vaccine. Human beings will be treated like human beings, wherever they are. 👏👏👏
106745	@stefaniangelise Yeah no I agree I don’t get it either, all those vaccines aren’t permanent either. The coronavirus has been around for a long time. There are different versions of it and this one is just the easiest spreading. I never got them until the army forced me on deployment to get them
106157	@UgimaKenya Maghufuli is right, it will be a long time before a valid vaccine is found. This means that herd immunity is the way to go presently. Western world covid19 template cant work in African economies. Something is wrong and we are stupid not to call out our inept president
201610	@LadyVelvet_HFQ I'm fully #vaccinated! on 17th Sep '21. 2nd Dose with #COVISHIELD #AstraZeneca Successfully completed the schedule of all doses of COVID-19 vaccine.
105870	@patton6966 Hello Mark, I was given the COVID-19 Vaccine. After a few day, I noticed my joint creaking, then my skin became metallic! I am now a robot and am typing this with my mind. How do I tell the world my story Mike? Beep Boop
106777	Why do some ppl expect a NEW vaccine for a NOVEL (uh, new - never been seen before, figuring out how to treat as we go) Coronavirus to be 100% effective on 1st release?  95% efficacy is pretty damn good. This is a HR and ppl are throwing the ball back on the field. *smh* 🤦‍♀️🤔
201648	I was able to get a COVID-19 vaccine appointment for my dad after waiting TWO hours for the confirmation email, because the site was so overwhelmed. My mom, also a 65+ high-risk stroke/diabetes patient, won her vaccine appointment through a LOTTERY. It shouldn't be this way.
106236	@POTUS don't force all Americans to get vaccine when available.  My body my choice I WILL NOT GET CV IMMUNIZATION.
105766	@davestwittylife They will keep moving the goalposts until November 5. If there is a Covid-19 vaccine in the meantime (very unlikely in my non-medically trained opinion), it will only be 50% effective at best, and will have very troublesome side effects, which they might not tell you about.
107099	And they can’t understand why people don’t take the shot,Vaccines don’t do what their telling us it does, stop trying to kill us
201770	I had the vaccine for #COVID19 today.  I had the JJ.  I still feel nervous.  Like waking up from a nightmare.  I am glad it is over but still stress for having it.
106203	@nick_ramsey Because the big wave is going to hit in 3 4 5 and 6 weeks and the coronavirus will come back next year cyclically by November 20/20 we need a coronavirus vaccine
201558	No hesitation booking my COVID-19 booster vaccine after the booking went live today, thanks to @Leic_hospital #GetVaccinated
106319	@globalnews Definitely not. However, I do hope all the blind conformists and unthinking sheeple will do so in order to give them a false sense of safety and security, so the rest of us can get our lives back. #Covid_19 #COVID19 #EndTheLockdowns #vaccine
106142	@AndreiManko It’s been warned about since day one. Hasn’t anyone stopped to even consider for a second why we haven’t ever had a coronavirus vaccine? Like, ever? There has always clearly been a market for one.
106978	@CDCgov Does the old COVID-19 vaccine work on new virus? Does it stop the spread or just lesson the symptoms? (Asking for a friend, please don’t ban me)
105242	@Gekotweets @Ayaanle_bdi Are you implying Coronavirus is god's revenge on the French for banning Hijab?
106909	@realDonaldTrump @GavinNewsom Perhaps in a year to 18 months there may be a vaccine to stop the spread.  One for the coronavirus as well.
106892	Coronavirus vaccines are free of charge. The NHS will never ask for payment or for your bank details. Be alert to vaccine fraud. #coronavirusfrauds
107244	I believe she has done a great job,her plan was to delay an all at once rush to avoid overloading the health care system which sheaccomplished but Sorry folks the reality is there are limits. Ex. what if there is no vaccine? Do we stay inside forever? never have surgeries?
106550	I wasn’t too sure about getting the vaccine, then Boris Johnson said he is getting it. He’s so trustworthy and has done a great job since becoming PM, that’s my mind made up, I will definitely be getting it too. Said nobody ever.
106177	Tested positive for COVID-19 , my symptoms are non existent. I was sick for a day or two. I think the fact that I took the vaccine has an influence in how I currently feel. I'm actually shocked.
106936	bullshit. the vaccine is a preventative measure, not something that is going to kill a child. before saying that kids shouldn’t get the vaccine, have you asked them about it? it’s their life, their choice. ones who want to get it, can get it. let them live their lives in peace
106083	You hear that @GOP, @GOPChairwoman McDaniel, and @realDonaldTrump the #CODVID19 will not disappear like magic. Unless we have a vaccine available so this virus is going to be around for awhile.
106215	For those of you who don't know. Covid 19 is being labeled a strain of the Coronavirus. Coronavirus is the common cold. Covid 19 has NEVER been isolated as a new strain. How can you make a vaccine for a virus that has NEVER been Isolated? You can't. Get It yet?
106724	@Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump Vaccine progress is good news.  However it is not useful information for how Covid-19 is being managed nationally as of today, or as of the previous 180 days , or as of the next 180days.  153k in death climbing to 300k more before the year is out.  “GREAT JOB NOT” Mr Puppet.
106381	"""almost every fifth #Pole believes that there is no #pandemic""So around 7️⃣ million people does not swallow next #coronashit waves🔥🔥🔥#coronavirus #Covid_19 #vaccine #WW3 #Poland"
201741	@RARohde Travel data indicates a large ( the largest I think) number of travellers from Wuhan.  Korea was third.  I got out of Beijing on the 24th,  7 days, nothing to report.  Got a Vitamin D shot and a Pneumonia vaccine. waiting. Had to cancel my flight to USA,
105250	Actually, flu vaccine upgraded annually.  Already Coronavirus vaccines on the market for pets and has been for DECADES.  Different strain just like influenza.  Flu vaccine comes out ahead of the season every single year. How are experts now saying January rollout not possible?
105813	And just so everybody is clear, getting the vaccine DOES NOT make you immune to getting Covid. What it does do is vastly decrease your chances of dying if you do contract the virus.
107419	There is no proof that this is even slowing Covid. It may be speeding it up. If the vaccine helps then why were the most covid-19 deaths in children, recorded over the last five weeks? If the vaccine is a vaccine then why are more children infected? Kids did not get sick in 2020.
105237	It’s easy. All those sitting around complaining they can’t get vaccinated are just being lazy. Don’t be lazy, go, get vaccine and save your own life.
105418	@BishopJakes This humans would have to test negative for covid-19 first, if not my house is just perfectly fine, we'll most likely get together when there is a vaccine. #Social_Distancing #StayHome
107410	@NoblePhares Covid-19 isn’t unknown, and there is actually a vaccine for it, and it’s free, and it works.. just take the damn vaccine
106577	Wow, just like Trump called it... the Wuhan, China Virus. It’s called covid19 because they already had a name planned for its purpose- the vaccine!
105797	To say I'm scared is an understatement. I'm still waiting for my vaccination schedule together with my fellow doctors &amp; nurses in Makati. Waiting for DOH to release how much vaccine will be allocated. So waiting game right now esp if private sector frontliners non hospital based
107327	Our poll find 53% don’t believe vaccine passports will be implemented 47% do #NoVaccinePassportsAnywhere #coronavirus #PoliticsLive #news #OpenForAll #FreedomDay
105663	This is a complete psy op. There is no way in hell that they are taking the actual vaccine. I would bet my life on it.
105730	OMG, I thought it was a compete hoax and conspiracy theory, but had my COVID jab earlier and my arm has just started beeping and connected to the Bluetooth on my phone… anyone else has this!?#COVID #coronavirus #AstraZeneca #PfizerVaccine #DeltaVariant
105274	You are absolutely 100% correct because when you get Covid you have more antibodies then when you get the vaccine. You are so right!!!
201701	Glad to have had my Covid19 vaccine today @CUH_NHS. Felt a bit sick for a few mins after the vaccine, but well worth having. https://t.co/Rvypg0yAcl
107050	@KalopaMom @RobertKennedyJr There is one sentence in this article that will prove they are lying... “While there are currently no known risks of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine while pregnant, scientists are in the process of gathering additional data to learn more.”  If you think there are NONE ur an idiot.
105226	I am vegan.  COVID19 vaccines are not vegan or cruelty free.  I don't want to have the vaccine for this reason. #TheOnlyWayIsVegan
106195	This is my story guys. Feel free to share yours. Maybe, just maybe, someone who is reluctant to vaxx will read it and decide they dont wanna go through what you went through and go get jabbed
106377	@dwallacewells I am triple vaxxed, but don't get why we don't lock down unless and until we reach a larger vaxxed percentage. Japan has 90% and pretty much no coronavirus deaths. We still have 1200+/day. If the endemic strategy is to succeed, we need more vaccinated ppl.
107088	@CBCAlerts “Doctors are worried that coronavirus may end up being like influenza, which requires a new vaccine every year both because the circulating strains mutate fast and because immunity from the vaccine wears off quickly.”
106595	@dspondike @BretWeinstein The question is how well those so-called “vaccines” actually work. Because they do not deliver “immunity”, the definition of “vaccine” was recently revised to a risk/benefit ratio—without acknowledging COVID-19 “vaccine”-related injury and death.
105472	I'm so going to enjoy rubbing this in the face of these Nigerian liberals. They called us all sorts for questioning the safety of their precious vaccines. Oya see am nau.And this will likely be the very tip of the iceberg.Mandating experimental drugs is stupid.
107415	We wonder when @ncstatecollege will do likewise. We don't want the Mansfield Campus to become a #SuperSpreader site. #VaccinesSaveLives!#PandemicOfTheUnvaccinated#richlandrocks
105892	It's only supposed to lower your symptoms... they've told everyone a million times, you can still catch the virus and have symptoms with the vaccine🙅‍♀️
106793	Suicide? 🤔 think “self suicide” is the only one that a person can do 😂😂😂 just love twitter kids being as insane as they can 😂 Tam SHOULD take her/his/their/there/xe own vaccine. Don’t ban me! Just don’t remember all the pronouns needed!
107263	Jill isn’t a real doctor y’all. We talked about this last week, so how is she already getting the vaccine?
106025	@kbeanie93 Turkey has stated you can enter without jab or a Coronavirus test. If enough people boycott other countries, they will either fill w turkey stance or face the end of their tourism. The people hold the power on this one, not the government
106427	It's getting worse not better. But hope may be on the way in the form of a vaccine and administration that actually TRIES to stop the virus
105728	@TradeEuropa Panic it's bad but we should preper to situation like in Wuhan it's now. Just to time vaccine in hospitals. China made this panic bcz ppl send so many movies with dead bodys, u can count this deadth cases &amp; thers numbers are bigger then China they give us in information.
105962	@Maselli_Andrea @Forbes Yea, just showing how stupid all of this is! People are wishing death on the other people who don't want to get this COVID-19 vaccine. And we never had people acting like this back in the day when other people didn't want to get any of those other vaccines we have out there.
106017	While I do not wish COVID-19 on any one or their loved ones but (you knew this was coming) if more are to get sick or die it would be ok with me because those without masks and vaccines provide those openings for the virus!
105953	@Forbes So the vaccines don't work?Wouldn't it be a better outcome to get and get over covid-19 if a person is young and healthy?
107481	“the covid-19 vaccine is like the PS5: everybody wants it, nobody can get it, and if you’re rich you already got it like a month ago” sometimes snl has good jokes
107308	Repeat after me:We are under lockdown to slow the spread of COVID-19 so that our healthcare systems can cope.We are NOT under lockdown to kill the virus or stop it.Life as we know it is done for the foreseeable, until we get a vaccine or herd immunity (maybe). Got it?
105667	@olives4fun @stltoday No mRNA vaccine has ever been approved, it doesn’t operate like a vaccine, it’s experimental and not fully tested. Every attempt at a vaccine against any coronavirus has made subsequent infection worse. There are effective treatments available.
105963	Dad got the COVID-19 vaccine today and mom gets it Monday!! I’m so excited for them and also a little jealous lol shoutout to my two favorite doctors 💜
105950	@GBNEWS Do you think it's weird how no world leaders not even the @WHO came out 2 years ago at the start of the pandemic and said take Vitamin D, take Vitamin C and take Zinc, do exercise and get sunshine? They never told us how to prevent getting #COVID19 they just said #vaccineswork
106983	@susan46775136 @kissandmakeupuk @dwilliam9940 It's not a vaccines, it's actually gene editing,permanently changing human DNA. New human species is the result. This has killed all tests animals it was tested on within 12 months after contact with a wild coronavirus. Time bomb ticking in jabbed population.
107418	Let’s get this clear, just because you get a flu jab does not make you completely immune to flu. So think, a half #coronavirus immune jab will not prevent getting it, so please have a brain, wear a mask&amp;wash your hands. Stay within your bubble &amp;home. @BorisJohnson @MattHancock
107042	if you haven't, please get vaccinated so we can go back to normal and all these people (including) won't be dying of a disease we already have the MF'ing vaccine for Just do it, you're wasting all of our lives now. Are we gonna spread this out another decade?
107238	If this is the case then why will I need to declare my vaccine status (with a piece of paper or app) to get into a pub? What next?  I had my hemarroids done before I can sit down anywhere?
107074	They vaccine will have aborted fetus cells in it, ipso facto, religious exception should be honored.  We are Americans not cattle
107583	@BBCBreaking I don’t get how they can say the so called vaccine will defeat this virus because coronavirus can’t be cured and will always mutate, also what about the Brazilian and South African strain, the vaccine doesn’t work with them.
107081	"Dr. Chaitra Ujjani: ""A lot of our patients have suffered in isolation and fear, and they're not sure they're going to get back to a normal life,"" ""So every oncologist is interested to see how their patients will respond to the vaccine.""@SeattleCCA"
105984	The 🇬🇧 fully supports @antonioguterres and the vital @UN work fighting #coronavirus. Today we discussed the need for a coordinated global response to reinforce the most vulnerable countries, accelerating the search for a vaccine &amp; bringing countries together to defeat this virus.
105863	A vaccine for coronavirus is coming.  But will it be ready, or not?  Trump has become obsessed with launching a vaccine, thinking it’s his best hope for reelection.  New polling shows voters seriously skeptical of the  remedy and the rush.
106131	▶️Full lockdown until we have a vaccine...OK▶️Live under authoritarian rule (but not full lockdown)       until we have a vaccine...OK▶️Vaccine may only be 70% effective...OK▶️Vaccine may only be 50% effective...WTF?!Do you not see what is happening?????????????
107279	@AyinAzirinee Depends how it’s ‘pinched’. The needle (for COVID-19 vaccines) should go into the muscle, so some pinching is ok but not till the needle only enters the fat layer. Usually pinching is not needed for intramuscular injections. Other vaccines might be different
106193	BUT, BLM/Antifa anarchy ‘gatherings’ are acceptable. Wake up America!They don’t wear masks because they know something they are not sharing with us? Fear is used to control, like demand you wear masks and stay inside.Bull!The only way forward is herd immunity,not deadly vaccines!
107479	@Browney86195309 As per the NHS website, having the vaccine gives you long lasting protection again Covid -19.  There is however still a small chance you can get or spread coronavirus, even if you have the vaccine.  P&amp;O Cruises are determined to protect the health of all guests and crew on board.
201572	@calico_heart_ My heart is failing and I have Stage 4 prostate cancer. No one wants to tell me how long I will be here. Got my two Covid-19 vaccine shots, though!
106435	Shit like this is why I stay home. And will be as much as possible even when they find a vaccine for the virus because unfortunately, there is no vaccine for this kind of stupid shit.
106792	Took my aunt @passionate4ever to get her first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at @meijer. Lots of people waiting, but very efficient and easy process getting in and out.
105617	So true. Vaccine in NZ pathetically slow. Not good enough to b smugly sipping flat whites and feeling sorry 4 the rest of the world. Need to re-engage.
105544	It is unknown how long the immunity provided by the #COVIDVaccine may last, however, if one still get infected even after #COVID19Vaccination, #COVIDVaccines protect against severe disease and hospitalisation due to #COVID19.#COVID_19 #COVID__19 #COVID #COVIDー19 #coronavirus
107206	Get the vaccine, or Don't get the vaccine. I do not care, because it is your choice. I will not treat you any different either way, and that my friends is how freedom works.#vaccine #COVID19 #freedom
107021	I said mutations would come. Sadly vaccine resistant ones will develop soon enough. Then a strain which attacks younger people with greater results. The pandemic will never end. Prepare for the worst. Hope for the best. Anarchy is only ever a few bad months away🙏
201742	Pfizer, for example, the company recruited 43,661 volunteers and waited for 170 people to come down with symptoms of Covid-19 and then get a positive test. Out of these 170, 162 had received a placebo shot, and just eight had received the real vaccine.
201658	I’ve just had my COVID-19 Oxford/AstraZeneca Vaccination. A huge thank you to @NHSuk @ENHertsCCG @StJohnsOx and the volunteers on hand.The process was seamless and conducted with military efficiency. Excellent 👏🏻 #CovidVaccine #oxfordastrazeneca https://t.co/VCdQkecHdn
105539	@Mike_Fabricant @ArchRose90 Why are employers sacking the un-vaxxed - the vaxxed can still get Covid-19 and still spread it to others - so there is no protection of staff or customers ??? Can any employer or manager or MP explain this ???
106906	THIS IS INFURIATING! 🤬 DO PARENTS NOT REALIZE HOW MUCH THEY ARE PUTTING THEIR KIDS AT RISK!?!?!? Immediately we should: 📍MANDATE vaccines for school (in person and virtual) 📍REVOKE CUSTODY if you do not get your kids vaccinated. 📍FINES AND/OR IF THAT DOESN’T WORK: JAIL!
106130	@CBCOntarioToday @SALCOntario This is laughable, the demographic that listens to your program doesn't work for or live in #poverty...How come cbc employees don't jump up to the microphone, like they did with #COVID19 and #VaccinePassport B.S., but these issues have been going on a lot longer then 2 yrs.??!!
107322	#Shame, #shame. #shame scaring people to NOT TAKE A VACCINE that may protect them from COVID19! USING FEAR BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE VACCINE IS COMING IS JUST WRONG! @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden

201662	@Formerlythefis1 I wish you the best with not any ill effects. Most people don't seem to have any bad effects. I'm also due coming up for it soon. The second shot took me down for several weeks. Unless I actually had Covid-19 at the time of getting the second shot of the Pfizer vaccine.
201792	First Jab done. Get your vaccine asap to eradicate Covid-19. ✌🏻#COVID19 #COVIDVaccination #CovidVaccine https://t.co/5L6ejEzyqr
201613	Shout out to my immune system for helping me survive when I was infected with COVID-19 one year ago. Several months later I received both doses of the Moderna vaccine. Now it is about that time for a booster shot. #getvaccinated #herdimmunity
107317	@destinchickMBA @ABC It's called a coronavirus and he downplayed it for months after asking if a flu vaccine would cover it or doctors had considered if uv light shined on the lungs would save us all. Unless he does something concrete nobody cares if he still blathers on like a fruitbat.
106922	@SkyNews @SkyNewsThomas Ooo, I think so. I have been anyway. I’m vaxxed and had the booster, so I’ve done as I’ve been told and I am not getting on with my life. #COVID19 isn’t going to miraculously disappear, so it’s time to start learning to live with it. You know, like we have for every other virus.
201726	The St. Joseph Health Department had a pleasant surprise at the second dose COVID-19 vaccine clinic held at the Open Door Food Kitchen Thursday. A handful of residents came to the kitchen and asked for the shot for the first time. https://t.co/kZxF6PmVcx
106798	Any sentence with “until we have a vaccine” is a waste of words.  When ever we do have one it will be 12 to 18 months for efficacy. Why is no one being realistic about this? #covid19australia #COVID19
107494	The #SerumInstitute of India wants ₹3000 crore from the Modi govt to ramp up the #vaccine production capacity in the #COVID19Era.Who do they think they are.Why would the govt waste such an amount that can easily fund another new Ultra Luxurious Jet Plane for our poor PM?
106815	The vaccines will eventually be here, but in the meantime (3+ months for most), there is a deadly COVID-19 storm raging out there, be very careful. ICUs and medical staff will be overloaded for months to come.
106923	So the entire #Covid_19 #lockdown is because “if it saves 1 life” so i’m guessing if the #vaccine kills 1 person its a no go right? #BillGates #COVID19
105594	Im done. This is me not leaving my house but once a week for groceries. I can't do this. I spent a year in fear for my life. I was relieved when I got the vaccine. But now this! I don't want to do this anymore.
201781	My mom is scheduled to get the COVID-19 vaccine next week! 🤗🙌🏾💉(Lol could've got mines too if I was still working at the hospital)
106467	"2/ Last I checked, ""China"" isn't sitting in the White House leading the US #coronavirus response from Jan 2020 to today. Mr. Trump is supposedly ""leading"" it. So guess who is to blame for how bad our country has handled it? The BUCK stops with @realDonaldTrump!#vaccine"
106080	#GenocideJohnson making us take it on the chin, letting it just move through the population, so our loved ones will die. As planned from the beginning, so continuing now. Mass death and disability without a vaccine.
107444	Absolutely not. That liquid called a vaccine has led to more infections throughout China. People think they are vaccinated and end up spreading the virus. Keep the virus contained there.
106669	I’m really struggling to cope with this pandemic, what if a vaccine is never developed and coronavirus never goes away? Will we have to socially distance forever? Every time I see the term ‘new normal’ in the media I’m filled with dread and anxiety. I can’t keep living like this.
106264	@NaviiThaHBIC @we38we38 @PkmnMasterHolly @MYSTIC7 Yes, but this wouldn’t be the first Coronavirus I survived. I served in an area that had MERS-CoV....and that coronavirus had a 35% death rate and it still doesn’t have a vaccine. And for 20+ years we have been sending people in and out, and nobody got test leaving.
106363	@BNODesk The best thing we can do is just live with and take basic precautions unless you want a booster shot every 2-3 months. It seems this coronavirus acts like a cold virus when it comes to escaping the immune system.

105707	So then why would I want to get it?!? If people were afraid to leave their house for a virus with a 99.9% chance of survival, I would say it’s justified for me not to want the vaccine if theirs a small % I will still catch the Vid. Right? I’m “tRuStInG tHe ScIeNcE”
105726	@o_rips I have just started following this stuff and I'm horrified, more so for my kids.It's hard that you can also not openly talk about it without being labelled as an antivax looneyScaring times ahead, how do we ensure we don't have to have covid vaccine when it comes out?
105972	This is just so unimaginable and sad. Thinking of everyone who lost someone. Please continue to stay safe and keep others safe by getting the vaccine.
105264	This really hit home.  One of the reasons I got my 1st covid vaccine was for my peace of mind.  Hopefully after my 2nd shot it will help me with my anxiety so I can leave my bubble that I have been living in for a year.  I need to do what is best for me. #COVID19 #anxiety
105474	About the vaccine..Research is still ongoing &amp; no one knows how long a person can be immune. Should people who already had covid with long-term effects be in a priority group too?#CoronaInfoCH #COVIDー19 #Covid_19 #coronavirus #switzerland #suisse #schweiz #retweet #share
105756	A Russian scientist has studied the coronavirus for 40+ years. He tells me that the virus has mutated over 22,000 times. So, the virus will win and stay with us. Good luck #NoVaccinePassports #NoVaccineMandates

105525	@erinotoole This pandemic has been catastrophic for the country - devastating for business and so hard on people and families. That you would politicise vaccines is scurrilous, unprofessional, self-serving and TERRIFYING, because people will believe you. STOP. RETRACT!
201645	We got the J-Book, Lil Fizz, Raz B, and Omarion variants because y'all can't make an accessible vaccine and the other g'all won't take it. Shit went from Covid-19 to Covid-B2K just like that.

106668	Is Djokovic vaccine hésitations catching up with him ? Some may think it is hubris.Did he catch coronavirus in the past or did people get infected after his tournament ?
105628	Why do they? I had no hesitation about taking the vaccine, everyone I know who’s had it had no hesitations and people yet to have it have no hesitations. Even if they do have hesitations they appreciate they have to. If anything it’s the older generations that are antivaxxers.
105695	Just keep it moving. Open it up so that everyone who wants to get the vaccine can. No point bemoaning the vaccine hesitant. With coaxing and different incentives, in time some will get it. As for those who are totally against it (a minority hopefully), nothing you can do.

105398	@hornyforwater @McauleyHolmes It starts there. Then they’re going to do the COVID-19 tracer.  Then it’s going to be mandatory vaccines.  They are killing more people in the isolation then they are the virus. The solution should never be worse than the problem &amp; it is!

106568	NOPE, you got it all wrong, it is to protect the people around you! We are not ever going to be the same as we once were! Maybe, in five years, but no time soon until they get a vaccine to kill the Covid-19 parasite.
106552	@mel_faith1 @Cocoa_Bean10 You make a good point, however COVID19 stands for coronavirus which is the easiest to make a vaccine for. We actually pick up what Chinese scientists were uploading that gave America a clue in the very first days. And my feeling is HIV was NOT deemed important to American’s.
106246	@SykesCharlie @JoeBiden who probably would not survive the novel #coronavirus, like @POTUS45 did, should be thanking #Trump profusely for the vaccine he received in December 2020.

105837	@Ponderosa1415 @Charb532 @corpkid1 @fakebillyzoom @GovRonDeSantis How was Sweden able to attain herd immunity from coronavirus long before the vaccine came out? Not everyone who doesn't want the vaccine is childish. If you'd actually listen to some of their reasons, you might not agree with their logic, but you might understand why.
107608	... people who had COVID-19 already may feel that they do not need to take the vaccine. I would be interested in pointers to whether people have checked for this, e.g. polls about vaccine hesitancy” including the option “I will not get the vaccine because I was already infected”
106356	Ok if this is for real??then this is bigand this also makes trump correct,just not the greatest at getting message across but it’s not his fault if stupid ppl want to drink bleach.but again if true,then this is big.I would if proven to be true and work do this b4 vaccines.
106289	how shitty can our country get that OTHER countries literally have to rush a vaccine so that they can help EVERYONE FOR FREE bc the US actually doesn’t care about helping those in need, they care about making  money LMAO i hate it here

107051	Here we go again, the politicians have ignored what the scientists told them: that if the virus wasn't suppressed the vaccine rollout would have the chance to achieve herd immunity, and we will be back to square one...
201505	My parents got vaccinated for COVID-19 today. Theres a lot of mixed feelings about this vaccine &amp; vaccines in general. But let me just say that having elderly parents in todays social climate, I am grateful that they decided to get it. I still need them here with me, God willing.

106560	@UWM @UWSystem @TommyThompsonWI stop waiting until things get terrifyingly worse and require the vaccine for students! You already messed up with moving in students into the dorms without it.

107273	Wake up idiots. Corporations do not have the authority or right to discriminate against you for not taking an vaccine. It's a violation of the Nuremburg Code and a human rights violation. They're lying to you as they demoralize you with lockdowns for compliance. #COVID19
106639	The way trump has embarrassed us on the world stage. Think about this. Assuming any other country creates the covid-19 vaccine before America does. Where will America fall on the distribution list. My guess is last. So hunker down folks.

105851	@RealMickFoley Yep!They've been working on the SARS-CoV-1 vaccine for over 20 years &amp; then when the coronavirus hit, SARS-CoV-2, they just switched to produce the vaccines we currently have to fight COVID 19.

105723	Add Italy to that list now too. The new coronavirus variant is around 70% more infectious, ministers say, but NO evidence so far to suggest it causes more severe illness or wouldn’t respond to vaccine.
105243	@MeidasTouch We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies. Ask the FDA about it.
105437	it's  getting  bad here.     We  are  walking  amongst  carriers.  it's  getting worse.  halt the  Xmas   rules.   lock up.  I'm  doubting this  vaccine  now.

107552	@RealKPenceNotSL How is a healthy unvaccinated person a public threat?  THERE IS NO VACCINE WHICH PREVENTS COVID19. Vaccinated does not equal immune, just like Unvaccinated does not equal infected. I can't even imagine why you would make a statement encouraging interning unvaccinated Americans
107557	@NCIDirector @FLOTUS @theNCI Realistically if we can get a vaccine in 1 year for coronavirus, because of unlimited funding from nearly every nation, course a cure for cancer is out there! Not enough is being done and too much red tape and greedy corrupt pharmaceuticals  #WorldCancerDay
107250	The “Leadership” calls Troops concerns about the vaccine as “excuses,” but if they get the vaccine &amp; have reactions...they will call their symptoms “excuses.”  And then they “Order” you to get it...despite VA denying Vets when you try &amp; claim compensation for adverse actions😒

105455	@TomiLahren The choice of whether to get the vaccine or not isn't only about whether we think that we ourselves would get Covid-19 or survive it if we do.  It's about achieving herd immunity to put the pandemic behind us once and for all so that life can get back to normal again.
106247	Hurray! Another vaccine being rolled out. Can’t happen fast enough. In awe of the vaccine/ID team in Oxford who have developed this so efficiently.

106965	My take, FWIW: the prediction that 60-80% of us will get coronavirus is still true.  And current level of lockdown can;t last until there's a vaccine.  So at some point we are all going have to go out and face the virus again, only this time more will catch it.  Question is when.

106217	@HillaryClinton New studies are coming out showing that if you had Covid-19 your still immune. So those who have had COVID-19 should consider if they need it or not. There are no long term studies on the vaccine to know how long it last since it’s NOT a virus. Be smart, research and decide 4 You
105621	@HD2onPBdotcom @yggdrasilash24 @tnewtondunn Doctors are being told to write Covid-19 for all patients. Even those dying of advanced cancer. Just like a doctor wrote pneumonia for my mother 20 years ago when what she actually died of was progressive supranuclear palsy. Who is selling the kits &amp; the vaccines? Follow the ££££
106774	@mbzy89 @samhealey1 @madhatterpress @AnnastaciaMP All viruses mutate and the native nature of a common coronavirus, (its not novel anymore after over 2yrs), is that the mutation devolves. No-one ever catches the same coronavirus twice due to how the bodies immunity system works.Faux vaccines will also create weird strains.
105938	I am sad to say this #coronavirus is not going away anytime soon, Even after a #vaccine, you cant #vaccinate for the basic coronavirus, so making a vaccination for #COVID19= I believe is next to impossible Simply because basic Coronavirus is naturally your common cold #virus!
107251	@ChrisAlderson17 A) Your immune system relies on antibodies to work, and if you haven't contracted this virus, you don't have any.B) Acute COVID-19 illness is multi-systemic, long-lasting and still poorly understood.C) Billions died of disease until vaccines were discovered.
107072	Just three Marines who requested a religious exemption to the legally mandated coronavirus vaccine have had their requests granted.THEY ARE PURPOSELY GUTTING THE MILITARY.
106749	@deray Besides there being no vaccine as yet, there’s also no antiviral (like Tamiflu) to ease coronavirus.
107367	EXCELLENT NEWS. Very SAD In My Own Country, The United Kingdom☹️ We Have Vaccines But Very Little Actual Vaccinations. Don’t Forget Us, Please.🙏🏻
106463	@piwnation Yes, they definitely can. It just depends on the company you work for values. The COVID-19 vaccine is not the first vaccine to be mandated in the work place.
105294	@GOP Those of you who refuse to get the Covid-19 vaccine or don't get your second shot are the ones whining about the country not opening fast enough. You are the ones allowing mutations. Get the vaccine and get over it.
106608	Instead of just reading news headlines, you should do some actual research and educate yourself. Reading is kinda a requirement for being a legislator. There is a vaccine for the flu. We need to be careful and patient until we are able to get/ distribute a vaccine for corona.
107500	@Forbes Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
106218	@Get_To_Living @ashsimonee Where I work it’s optional too but hopefully down the road we don’t see infomercials about “if you or a loved one took the COVID-19 vaccine and later got diagnosed with (insert disease here) than you may be entitled to financial compensation” I don’t know the long term effects.
107035	@Jailbreak145Px @stoolpresidente We still have no vaccine for SARS or MERS, two other corona viruses from this century. They’ve been working on them for 8-17 years. I wouldn’t be so sure about this Coronavirus vaccine.
106569	I think there's many that would rather take their chances, me included.I don't want any of the issues that they'll possibly tag on to the vaccine, after all you'd be a customer for life, let's face it, big pharma need lifelong customers!#vaccines #COVID19 #TakeMyChance

106013	AMAZING…how does one make that much money for a free vaccine????  Has anyone so infatuated with the idea of a free vaccine even questioned this ponzi scheme ??!
201624	@shellymarriage @CHCHNews @CHCHTV Sadly I just missed it ! Just turned on @CHCHNews as I just got home from getting my 1st covid19 vaccine
107126	So let me get this straight. We could get over coronavirus in the summer because of the heat but we don’t know if cv can survive in it or not, a vaccine can take a year, isolation/quarentine for 6 months??? Yeah...no
107124	@TonyGuanthwei @buffalohunterCB @CarryOnWaywdSon @Roscoe17761 @laralogan What vaccine did they take??was it really applied and in the right dosage??did they not get covid19 in the hospital before taking the vaccine???The vaccine prevented them from dying.
106794	Now a pill has been introduced to beat covid19 is there really any need to repeatedly inject people? The 'vaccine' 🙄 efficacy does not last, it has to be repeatedly given so why not treat instead?
201540	@TurmoilRockBand @WG_Gervais @AMcA32449832 @arkmedic all crew on the deployment had received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine and the outbreak was being managed.

106382	i just sat in an 8 hour flight with a trump supporter who wouldn’t stop ranting about how the coronavirus is all a part of trump’s plan and that as long as we don’t take a vaccine then we won’t get infected,,,,,,
107447	1. I have absolutely considered this happening. A week or so before the election, Trump will get an FDA approval for a vaccine. Their CEO will hit the news circuits saying that the vaccine couldn’t have happened without Trump.

105383	Can we normalize not asking people if got their vaccine? Like seriously, it’s a violation of my HIPPA! Do you go around asking everyone you talk to if they have an std or ever had an abortion? I didn’t think so. #NoneOfYourBusiness #KeepThatSameEnergy #Covid19 #Vaccination
106763	It’s so tiring to listen to the MSM blame conservatives for the spike in the coronavirus.  If it were up to them, we would all be in a deep dark depression and no one would leave their home until there was a vaccine.
107392	@baccantuscany @TeaPainUSA when Coronavirus vaccine comes out, they should just pray. They have God on their side.
106039	@Walkabout24 Difficult! I've had my 1st Covid-19 jab because, as a COPD sufferer, my respiratory system is compromised. I've had a pneumococcal jab for the same reason. I will never carry a vaccine passport, vaccination is an invasive procedure &amp; must always be voluntary.
105883	It is everywhere. Everywhere. Contact tracing will be close to impossible in the coming weeks. Where did you get it? From anywhere. From anyone. It. Is. Everywhere. We are excited for vaccines. They can't come soon enough. Those @pfizer trucks better drive safely:)

106208	Surely u guys have to read this important one. First thing u know why lockdown as an effective measure. How we keep the reproduction number or R value below to 1 (R&lt;1). Simple to peter out spreading this outbreak. Instead of im not sure for vaccine, just keeping ur ego first.

106123	The left displays yet again their political narrative of #COVID19. They don't want a successful vaccine because they don't want life to return to normal. They hate self determination. They need people relying on govt. They're the ones who don't value human life. #LiberateAmerica
106504	Exactly and died few days later. Of course they don't want people to know. How else can the VACCINATOR depopulate the world if people refuse the vaccine. Hence no body gets their stimulus money unless they take the vaccine. Fuckouttahere.

105683	The likelihood is coronavirus is here to stay forever, like any virus. However there is no vaccine currently. We are in a recession, money makes the workd go round. so how do you move forward? Wouldn’t like to be making that decision.
106391	@21WIRE That's actionable legally I think, they haven't isolated the covid19 virus, so how can there be a test or a vaccine?  Lawyer up if you can parents and students.

106771	We still don’t know if having #antibodies gives immunity but it surely has to be good to have them! It’s also a relief to be know for def I had #Coronavirus. The results can tell researchers where outbreaks have been in Scotland and antibodies may also be used to make a vaccine.
107048	They’re just hoping the vaccine comes through quick enough so they don’t face pressure to do anything substantive

107464	@BeholdIsrael Amir didn't say to get the Covid-19 vaccine. It isn't the mark of the beast, either. If it's combined with the quantum dot, might be the precursor, but for it to be the 'mark', you'd have to choose to serve the anti-christ. True Christians won't be here then. Not saying to get it
105467	So, a mandatory vaccine policy, but not a mandatory vaccine? So just words and nothing meaningful. 😑 “Education session”? That’s the whole problem - anti vaxxers getting Facebook and YouTube educations. If they cared to learn they would have by now. #LTC #LTCJustice #onpoli

105906	Kudos University of Ghana. Kudos Noguchi. We've been waiting for news like this. Keep the vaccine too coming...
107446	@fionamflanagan1 The goal of the BLT-L mice project in Saskatoon is to make a pan-coronavirus vaccine for humans. If it is the Mark of the Beast, perhaps it's fitting that 100's of babies are being sacrificed to make the humanized mice to test it, but very few care about any of that.
107345	@chipshrimpson @CraftFan33 @LisaMarieBoothe the animal reservoirs found in coronavirus enable the virus to pass between humans and animals thus meaning you will never eradicate this virus with a vaccine like which was able to be done with polio or small box…neither polio nor small box had animal reservoirs
105609	This is what 2020 logic looks like folks. You have to take a rushed vaccine with lower efficacy than your immune response to the virus or face permanent restrictions on your freedoms 🤦🏼‍♀️Even with a vax restrictions might have to stay, because our government want us to be safe 🙄
106820	This... this is actually pretty cool. They're all bad guys but people are dumb and look up to them and need to get a fuckin vaccine.
105805	can’t believe they are people smart enough to develop a coronavirus vaccine and i’m proud of myself for weeks if i get ONE question right on university challenge
105579	If we can't get vaccines in a timely manner, perhaps this is a worthwhile option for Alberta @jkenney .
105853	A jury delivered a split verdict for a radical government. 'The nature of the coronavirus pandemic this week they've begun testing their experimental coronavirus vaccines on humans in the U.S.
106880	This is impossible.There is no way that they would even have 100 safe, tested, verified vaccines produced.We already know how to make vaccines for influenza, which mutates each year, and we barely manage to get those out in a 12 month span.
107101	@LoveLover75000 @SusanStJames3 If you take a Coronavirus vaccine, you're insane.  Do some research.  Also, it's not needed. HCQ works as treatment, and there are other therapies being worked on. We are way closer to herd immunity than ppl realize, by the time they have a vax, it won't be needed.
106460	"@mattandrews1023 @JoeConchaTV I think COVID-19 is an unpredictable problem. We know it's not going away anytime soon. Being ""done"" with it means having a vaccine. Some 200 vaccines are in development and will take a year or more to be effective if we're lucky."
107622	Why do they need a vaccine since according to them COVID is a made up virus, or no worse than the flu, and they can’t be bothered to wear masks? How about give it to frontline workers in ALL industries first, esp those forced to work in dangerous conditions by executive order?
106599	Ya no shit Sherlock.  If the vaccine does not stop the spread then it is more like an antibiotic. And we know what they say about taking too many antibiotics.
105830	And how the hell do y’all know the vaccines work against the “Delta” variant, when there is no actual proof behind it. People just keep lining up though.
107547	17 hours after getting the COVID-19 vaccine for the second time, and my head is throbbing with an amount of pain. I've had migraines that are worse, though. My eyes hurt my entire body just feels like a bruise. I feel vaguely feverish, but it's not enough to actually BE feverish.
105453	@NSimmo8 @Nikki_EDD @LonsdaleKeith @ukboffin1 @IsabelOakeshott We aren’t really immune to flu because it’s one of those virus’s that mutate every year-so a new vaccine is needed -whereas they can’t even find a vaccine to cure the coronavirus
105433	@SBSNews @FatherBob 200 with 150 fines and 15 arrests apparently. And if a single one of them comes anywhere near my family there will be hell to pay! The rest of us have given up so much to try to beat this bloody #coronavirus but there's no vaccine for stupid. #auspol
107511	I truly hope that this would NOT happen, but science is science. This is like the polio vaccine all over again. Protect your children, folks. Don't play politics with their lives. As a retired educator, this makes my heart ache more than you can imagine!
105447	@SyzygyXq @whatdivawants @Brittannnny_88 @YouDontKnowISH_ @RollingStone Since you're blaming the unvaccinated for the poor efficacy of the vaccines, do you have any proof it's not antibody dependent enhancement occuring in the vaccinated - which occured in all prior attempts to make a coronavirus vaccine?
107001	"@nytimes @cmarinucci If you've gotten any other vaccinations, there's no ""religious"" excuse not to get the #COVID19 vaccine."
107484	I wonder what could be causing this?  Duh.  Obviously the Vaccine IS NOT WORKING or it is causing it!
106325	@dylnmcndrw @PaulAqua2 @MagicVindaloo @ToniaBuxton Hey I'm just going what the figures say. The exact same can be said for the coronavirus. Someone gets Corona virus gets killed by a car and they put that down as Corona virus. So the hell would I take a rushed vaccine for over inflated deaths. I wouldnt
106974	@djnicholl This is really sad…sorry for your loss!! I just got the news sadly my cousin in his 40s just passed away from COVID in #Iraq, he did not have access to #COVID19 vaccines….everyone out their please please take the opportunity ASAP!!
107521	@C_nrad @aaronsibarium If people lose confidence in government vaccine regulators, then they will stop getting *all* vaccines, not just coronavirus vaccines, and then we will have regular outbreaks of all kinds of preventable diseases.
106915	Oh Captain, my Captain! Is Covid catching up to Sir Patrick enough to get people/govt to put on their fucking masks, get vaxxed, social distance, sit still, etc.
105933	"I hope someone tweets to ask why I got the vaccine. I'm gonna be like, ""Umm... THE CORONAVIRUS,"" and it should really do numbers."
107333	There… now everyone complaining about the vaccine not being FDA approved can stuff it, and GO GET VACCINATED.
106197	So the UK government is telling me i should I get 3 maybe 4 vaccine shots to protect me against a virus so deadly that our own government is having parties whilst we are all locked down! Clearly they are not scared so why should I be!! I’ve never been more anti Covid! #COVID19
107122	Why is she telling people to get the vaccine and that the vaccine doesn’t work in the same paragraph?!  Why put crap in your body that doesn’t work, but causes other issues?
107096	@jimmy_dore Newsflash 🚀 😱 You can still get Covid-19 aka China Virus after getting vaccine aka gene therapy.  It is not 100% effective.
105980	Mind blowing question....They have a vaccine for Covid 19.So why isn't there a vaccine for the other 5/6 Coronavirus in general circulation.Cos we know what they are?Cwor. This is a legit question.
106063	First, I wish this participant, who bravely volunteered, the very best and hope they suffer no long term sequelae from this. Second, this is why we need trials. Exactly. This. #CovidVaccine
107656	@LozzaFox We do not need a vaccine. We have a safe treatment that has proved 100% successful... it’s called Hydroxychloroquine
201524	After initially being hesitant about getting the COVID-19 vaccine, I'm happy to report that I got my Pfizer booster shot today.If you're like me, then you, or someone you know is also a bit hesitant, and that's where we gotta approach the situation with patience and empathy.
201560	I’m high risk and have been shielding for a year with a congenital heart condition. It took 2 letters from my cardiologist to get the vaccine this week. They never admitted the error. My doctor said I should have been in the first round of those to receive it. #nhsfail
107598	@JustinTrudeau @jjhorgan You see this??? This is how it is suppose to be! Now get to it and follow suit. Quit being power hungry 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡#NoVaccinePassportsAnywhere
105288	At 6.30am this morning the first person in the UK recieved the Covid-19 vaccine. Hopefully this is the beginning of the end of the pandemic. Good luck to Margaret Keenan and everyone else getting the vaccine in the next weeks and months 🙏
105485	I am not an anti-vaxxer as I consider the Sabin and Salk polio vaccines to be one of the greatest achievements in human history). However, I don't trust the efficacy of these rushed vaccines for Covid when there has never been a successful vaccine for any Coronavirus. /1
107063	What an idiot. Treating someone for a virus before they actually have the virus doesn't make any sense. Treatments for coronavirus do not give you immunity to the coronavirus in the future - that takes a vaccine.
106966	@PWZambino @GOPLeader If there wasn't new variants of the flu there would be no need for an annual flu shot. We can't get ahead of the coronavirus any more than the flu. A true vaccine would only protect us from one variant not others that become immune to the vaccine.
107502	If the vaccines work then why does and approved vaccinated American need to stay in Canada for 15 days?
106609	@Law09804159 @Wanda2116 @NBCNews (5) It’s theoretically possible but sadly because there isn’t much demand, there is little funding for it. If HIV became a same destructive scale of Covid-19 global pandemic, a vaccine would’ve been developed.  For cancer, you can’t make a vaccine because
106636	Waiting for @thegreatleader8 to make a statement about the #coronavirus. What can we do to protect the children? Do the vaccines work, or just an excuse for gov to control our minds? Is this revenge from the Chinese? Is it too late for us?
107576	As someone in a Covid-19 vaccine clinical trial that won't conclude for 2 more YEARS, Trump's continued claims that a vaccine will be released in the next few weeks or months is how do you say... La foutaise...
107393	If I didn't have to get groceries I'd never leave my house till we had a vaccine for #covid19.  I can't even describe the fear I feel when I do.
107487	Trump: Millions Of Americans Getting COVID-19 Is ‘Terrific’ And A ‘Powerful Vaccine’The president seemed to suggest the U.S. is approaching herd immunity. It’s not.
107064	@CoventryGhost @gameOFshane @PalmerReport Recovering from COVID-19 doesn't give you permanent immunity. I have an antivaxxer nephew who has had it 3 times now. It's doing him long term damage but he is still stubbornly refusing the vaccine. Good luck.
105549	"I was offered the COVID-19 vaccine today by my employer to avoid wastage (I work in the public sector). I was surprised when they actually offered it to ""anyone who would like it"", and didn't ram it down people's throats and make them feel immoral for not wanting it 😏🙂"
105451	Waiting for the Coronavirus Vaccine so that everyone Could have a normal life like it used to be before. God bless.
107615	Today is the one year anniversary of creating the Moderna vaccine. &lt;0.5% of the US population has received any vaccine. We need to do better.
105652	#margaretkeenan is a very brave lady and lovable granny. I pray all goes well after being the first recipient of this jab. Who is next? I propose that the whole cabinet go after Maggie and then the Royals. This is to give us confidence in this #vaccine #COVID19
106919	I had a tetanus two years ago but ill never have this poison so am I vaccine hesitant  shouldn't habe that either as nothing was going to happen after I cut my leg. It healed very nicely w my own immune system
105245	@WebMD This is nonsense. There are vaccines and treatments for the flu. Hopefully, there will be one for COVID-19 by December. These scare tactics help no one, especially since the overwhelming majority of the country is still living in isolation and struggling with depression.
107466	@FaceTheNation @ScottGottliebMD @WhiteHouse I’m thinking speed is not the most important element when it comes to developing a vaccine for the coronavirus. I’m thinking maybe safety? Efficacy? Just throwing it out there.
106878	@Sue76329293 @CascianoJeri @mariapaolarj @joerogan SARS-COV-2 Covid is a coronavirus, so are some cold viruses. Humans do not build robust lasting immunity to coronaviruses. You can and will catch them again and again. No vaccine protects anyone from any disease 100%.
105772	Some people think the mere raising of a question is a refutation, or a dismissal, or an attack on an idea. Detailed answers sometimes require deep expertise. This thread explores why we might have a #COVID19 vaccine long before one for HIV, SARS &amp; MERS. Good thread!
105427	Exactly why it needs to stop being called a vaccine!! It’s a shot just like the flu shot. It doesn’t stop you from catching it or passing it on but it does help your body fight it if one does contract COVID. Really think more folks would get it if it was properly marketed.
106624	Pence is saying we’re gonna have a vaccine soon. Why did we wait till early 2020 to start working on one when the virus was rampant in China in 2019? Why dismantle the pandemic task force? Why call it a hoax at first? #Mismanagement of #coronavirus #VPDebate #VPDebate2020
105832	@tunkuv @asymmetricinfo “universal vaccines will also target proteins found in the core of the virus which are far less likely to mutate” and “We don’t necessarily claim it will be a pan-coronavirus vaccine, but it has got the potential to be so simply because of where it is targeted.” aren’t definitive
106447	@IvankaTrump @DailySignal I'm more interested in your discovery of a vaccine for Coronavirus. How's that coming?  Sorry, you're probably too busy getting trademarks for the masks you're having made in China. My bad.
105884	Being awake while they pulled out the food and breathing tubes is a feeling I’ll never forget. This wasn’t COVID-19 related so I can’t imagine the long-term toll a respiratory disease like this will take on someone’s body… fuck this absolute shit man. Please get vaxxed
107146	@edcokpareke @Advocat78311031 @jiranma @hitRECordJoe Sars yes, influenza no... wow... this is what we're dealing with... and no we haven't successfully made a vaccine for a coronavirus before. Not even hard to research. Seconds is all it would have taken you. Unbelievable.
105483	If you haven’t figured this out yet…masks first, vaccinations next. This is nothing more than a preparation for vaccinating children. Letting kids go maskless would only prove they don’t need this vaccine, so keep them masked until they can vaccinate them.
105524	Then we will see how loyal Donald Trump's followers are to him. I mean they're willing to catch covid-19 and die from that why not be the first one to get the vaccine. It's only right.
107219	Viruses as we have been taught to understand them don’t exist and the colds and flus we can get is a natural process our bodies go through usually once or twice a year. So why do they really want us all to have flu jabs while forcing us to wear masks in the summer? I know why
106347	An absolute disgrace. Fed and NSW governments deserve very heavy scrutiny for how they let this happen - how getting a vulnerable community like this vaxxed wasn’t a priority, MONTHS ago, is beyond me. Woeful stuff.
105503	People will legit do coke with no hesitation but when it comes to a life saving tested vaccine it's an issue??? OK
105382	Once vaccines roll out, it’s super important to keep track of WHICH vaccine you get! DO NOT MIX DIFFERENT VACCINES!!!
107261	"@markheseltine In Tasmania we currently don't have any Covid-19 cases, new or active. Our ""border"" is closed to the other states and I hope it only opens up to the rest of Australia once new case numbers there go to zero, or we have a vaccine. It's too important to get wrong."
106674	still my fellow Americans!4. I don't get the flu vaccine because...(in regards to coronavirus) I don't want to increase my chances of getting an upper respiratory illness including 4 strains of coronavirus by 36%.
106378	He's an expert in WMD. An expert in Charity scams. An expert in war tactics. Why not an expert in Vaccines? The man is irrelevant but you need to ask 'why they keep wheeling him out. What is he part of?
106720	So my son in law has MS and is not getting the COVID19 vaccine because he says his Neurologist says it's not worth the risk of a relapse. Do I believe him...No I think it's political. My Neurologist says getting Covid if you have MS could be a death sentence.Thoughts anyone?🤔
105411	Roy Blunt lies! Republicans passed a 3 Trillion budget that Americans did not even get a little. They misappropriated funds for Veterans families they got zip! Covid19 relief is for vaccines so all people can get vaccines and so schools can open safely.  So people get relief

107653	One of my questions I have: Is COVID-19 going to mutate like the flu does every year? Once a vaccine is developed, would it be like getting the flu shot? Or is this a one and done thing like getting the shot for chicken pox when we’re little? Do we know yet? @drsanjaygupta
105915	It’d be such a cool @MNightShyamalan twist if the vaccine for #Covid_19 turned out to be Shamrock Shakes.
107002	How do you define infants? Under 2 months? How about 8, 11 months? They also have unvaxxed siblings in daycare or school. In-person school now? I don’t think so. Not until further measures are in place. #COVID19 #onpoli #safeschools #onted #vaccinesavelives #COVIDisAirborne
106558	@faced_mc @DoctorChristian You might be asking for a vaccine, but I won’t. Neither will many sensible people. A rushed through vaccine can pose a far greater risk to your health than coronavirus. think I’ll take my chances with my own immune system.

106891	@marty_walsh @BCYFcenters These tests yield 50% false positives - test positive for any coronavirus (i.e. if you had a cold or took the flu vaccine), and if you test positive they count anyone you were in contact with as positive as well.  They want the numbers up to keep us iving under tyranny.
106637	The COVID-19 virus is a plague that can be avoided if you would only get the virus vaccine shot. But then if you want to die keep doing what you are doing ,but then all the innocent people you are taking with you. You should be put down before you kill them too.
106868	It is just so depressing. Hard to get out of bed.The federal gov't is frscking up vaccine deployment.Ppl continue to not take the #coronavirus seriously. So many Americans dying.I am beyond sad. I feel hopeless.2021 isnt looking any better....

Bill Gates &amp; anyone he associates with are evil scum
105517	@audreyy_kaye You who have the vaccine for covid-19 do not want to get it and you complain and put thousands of excuses and in my country that maybe in 11 years we will be able to be vaccinated against that virus, just get the vaccine in my country friends family doctors are dying of covib-19
106417	this is my friends mother atm, she is a nurse but doesn't trust a vaccine made within a few months... idk how to take that
107043	What I'm hearing is that they didn't have access to a larger list of people to receive the vaccine.Meanwhile many have no access to it.It's a brand new vaccine.Of course no everyone would wanna go first.Stop making it out like it's not normal, when the numbers show it is.
106866	My dad is finally going to get his COVID-19 vaccine this week 🥰 Now everyone close to me will be vaccinated 😭 💜 I’ve been so worried about him. A little less stressed now 🙏🏼
105373	Oh now healthcare workers are saying getting #VacinatedAgainstCovid doesn't actually PREVENT you from getting #COVID19 but only from dying from it!!! Now the #BoosterShots are being pushed/required!!! No! I'm not in a rush to get it although I'm being forced to before my surgery!

106939	What’s with the flags? There is no ‘patriotic’ or nationalistic angle at all to Covid-19 vaccinations. It’s being rolled out in accordance with clinical priorities, not status. This flag-waving from Ministers encourages idiots to say they are waiting for the ‘British’ vaccine.
201747	@cameroncowan She had a sore arm with the 1st COVID-19 vaccine, and needed 1 day off work to rest with the 2nd one.She's perfectly healthy. And she's safer from COVID-19. 90% of COVID-19 ICU patients are unvaccinated.99% of COVID-19 deaths are unvaccinated.

105229	This is our biggest risk. A mutation like this but one which doesn’t respond to the vaccine. If this happens, it’s essentially back to square one, circa late 2019 and we have to start all over. Only way to avoid this is to vaccinate everyone worldwide ASAP.
105922	This is crazy impressive. They're gonna overtake Latin American countries who've had access to the vaccines for months.
107336	This is huge! Waiving IP protections will allow mass production of vaccines around the globe. Time to take extraordinary measures to end this pandemic. Herd immunity will only be achieved if all countries achieve it. #MedTwitter #COVID19 @CDCgov @WHO @IDSAInfo

201766	My father passed away due to #COVID19 in April. Today my mother is getting the first jab of her #Pfizer #vaccine which is hopefully the beginning of the end of this nightmare. I am incredibly grateful to the scientists who have enabled this and to the #NHS
105588	@spotted_model Even if a vaccine for COVID-19 is developed, many Americans will probably refuse to take it. Something is broken.

105698	Let's try this. Instead of a swear box, every time you want to go out for an all-night bender during a pandemic, put that cash in a box for a huge party when we have a vaccine and can safely get together again. (Or better yet, support your local restaurants doing take-out)
106367	@Derridian @Wendy_Bacon @smh first business will be to privatise any #coronavirus vaccine our labs produce, for multinational profit .. then put all pensioners etc onto Twiggy's Indue card .. and probably set up some mega databases of private medical information to mine for electoral purposes #coronavirus
106523	Just seen Mike Pence on TV after he took the COVID vaccine, and it looks like he's aged about 10-20 years in the face.I want to keep my good looks so if that's a side effect of taking it then fuck the vaccines. #COVID19 #coronavirus
106212	The report is of concern because it suggests that immunity to the coronavirus may last only a few months in some people. And it has implications for vaccines being developed for the virus.
105391	@GeorgeTakei Due to my white privilege I will be donating my covid-19 vaccine to someone less fortunate. No need to thank me just doing my part.
105461	@BTone2020 @beverly_road @StephenMangan It’s a combo of extreme resources (money and minds) put on finding a vaccine plus, coronavirus’ are known so it’s not like they started completely from scratch to start with.
107334	@Naija_PR WahalaI believe in Jesus Christ but truly know covid19 is real and God has given us vaccine so you telling not to take it... Where were in lockdown? Nigerians please take vaccine and be safe God will not do that for you...
105714	"@dranthonyf Why is no one describing how difficult it's going to be to distribute and store the newer coronavirus vaccines because the ""cold chain"" requires ultra-cold refrigeration (-20C and -70C)? What CVS has these types of refrigerators?"
105324	Lockdowns “SLOW” the spread but can never STOP the spread. When they lockdown it’s actually “slowing” herd immunity. That’s why Big Pharma needed to slow it down, so they could get blessing for a covid19 vaccine of a virus that seemed to linger. But wouldn’t happen otherwise

107235	@JamieWoodhouse @susautorecycltd @chrischirp The UK pop has 93% antibodies. If the vaccines work NPIs are pointless. If they don't work (and despite decades of research, no coronavirus vaccine has ever worked) then NPIs are pointless, especially if R0 of omicron is much higher. The arrogance of thinking we can affect it...!
107313	If you need 4 shots a year of this crap, can we just all admit it isn’t a vaccine and it doesn’t work?
106200	We should stop pretending the vaccines are 100% safe and risk free for all.They trigger immune system responses *by design* and you don’t know how your immune system will react until you get the shot.Thus this is a risk calculation for anyone.I will keep wearing my kn95s.
105839	@ShaunLintern @WhackyRacesPP Also. We've tried to make Coronavirus vaccines before, with no success. And all of a sudden, everybody can make a successful one. Even a company that's never made a vaccine before (Moderna) amazingly develops a successful vaccine. It all sounds too good to be true...
106350	This is not a flu 🤧. Covid-19 is the grim reaper comin’ for ya 💀.  The vaccine 💉 is free and available. If you can still make the choice you have time to get the vaccine. Life or death (☀️ or 💀)?  🤔 #GetVaccinated #VaccinesSaveLives
106573	@Scott40128166 @DrTomFrieden How do they detect the delta variant? Has it been isolated? Has COVID-19 been isolated? How do u create a vaccine for a substance you cannot isolate?
105321	@KFLAPH and so should we. Especially with @FordNation getting rid of mandates everywhere. I will not feel safe to get any medical care now that mandates for HCW are gone. DO THE BOOSTERS for everyone. Now. Do not wait until things get bad. Do it. Toronto is.
107310	These measures are designed to balance reopening while controlling the spread of COVID-19 and saving lives. We’ve come a long way, but it is still critical that we mask up, socially distance, wash our hands, and get the vaccine when it’s our turn in order to end this pandemic.
107245	Dear #UPSC2020 aspirants and people demanding #PostponeUPSC_CSE I want to reach out to you guys. Just demanding a postponement arbitrarily till Dec has no logic!  genuine demand should be a coherent and clear one. No vaccine &gt; no exam. The virus has post treatment complications.

105416	How will they justify the rollout of Bill Gates' vaccines if they focus on the epicentre and actually stop the spread?
106273	1 - not concerned at all. We have to learn how to live with this virus. Herd immunity will work. Not taking any vaccine for this virus.
107546	@savyrecords And what people are forgetting is that this is a coronavirus...vaccines for coronavirus' don't stop infection &amp; transmission. So you could be forced to take changing formulations  multiple times a year without question or recourse.

105332	@H2OandPowerLaw This is for hpv, not coronavirus, so it's just about one potential way to lower the cost and increase supply of an already successful vaccine.  (e.g. so all countries can afford to give it, and to boys as well as girls).  Nothing to see here, move along :-)

106011	If you get the Covid-19 vaccine &amp; get mild flue-like symptoms, then test positive for Covid-19, it only means the vaccine is doing what it is supposed to do. All 3 vaccines, contain or produce covid-19 spike protein.  The rapid antigen test actually tests for this protein.
107174	@billpeduto @ConorLambPA What can be done to make sure that the vaccine gets to the groups in the order that's been dictated?  If this is going to keep happening then throw it open to everyone.  The clinic should be held responsible here too.
106711	Just a friendly reminder that the covid-19 vaccine does not make you IMMUNE from the virus. Why do you think people in Japan wear masks. They do it not to protect themselves, but to protect others. Let’s flip the script and maybe care a little more for each other?

106103	@DMADave You're not alone Dave. I'm 84 and will refuse the vaccine. If they make it mandatory I'll fight to the death. I'm not anti-vax as I've had the flu jab since it came out but the covid-19 vaccine, it's a NO from me.
106967	They're gonna release a vaccine for coronavirus and everyone will fall over themselves to get it and it'll turn out to actually be some mind control thing like in Deus Ex
105998	@Cheryl04148981 @MrERyter @InformedRN76 @catturd2 Yes. And this is also when people get the flu vaccine but end up with the flu anyway. It’s another strain not included in the vaccine that just shows up. Work in lab long time and we’ve had a panel of 4 coronavirus strains to test for years. Covid 19 is another strain.

105559	@Barbiewithatude @CNBCJulianna @TonyFratto How's the vaccine work on the new coronavirus variant? Go ahead, Ill wait. 🐑🙂
106695	The top US virus expert has warned against rushing out a Covid-19 vaccine before it has been proven to be safe and effective.
105545	@TexasTribune that is because you can't hide from any virus, coronavirus has been around for many years. A flu vaccine doesn't stop the flu, (common sense) is gone. Florida is open and not surge or anything. Stop being stupid
105806	"This is STILL PISSING ME OFF NO END!ALL of those asshole GOP politicians that spent the last 10 months downplaying and calling COVID-19 a hoax were all the FIRST IN LINE to get the vaccine.WHY ISN'T THE MSM ASKING THEM ALL WHY?Do they now suddenly ""BELIEVE""?What changed?WTF?"
106761	I think staying in and following the guidelines like the Health Department tells us to do is the only way to control this virus. Keeping more cases down so the vaccine if ever it gets to the medical doctors, it can control it. Just my 2 cent's.
105967	@birmingham_live This is hardly news. #COVID19 is a novel coronavirus, like SARS. There wasn't a vaccine for SARS, just effective public health measures to eliminate its spread and threat.
107472	@AllSaintsDai @televisionaryZW @pupadhyaya_ Right, although they can create illness. Happens pretty often. It’s not that people SHOULD get sick, it’s that people WILL get sick. We’ve never created a coronavirus vaccine and the biggest reason is they take so long that it’s usually not needed by the time it can be deployed
107199	But...checked my local area info and they’ve started on group 5 so hopefully not too long now #covid19 #vaccine #group6 #type1diabetes
106501	@GMB imply one in five will refuse the vaccine, and yet @YouGov nationally discovered only one in ten would refuse it. So who are #GMB asking to get their personal stats? #COVID19 #COVID
106088	@spikedonline @FraserMyers #France #Republic#RevolutionNow #stjust No, the #French are an #awaken #libertarian #nation They have a history of confronting #tyranny#Covid19 and #Shadow #KingMakers are their new targetCongratulations France #Vaccine or Not, do keep going!
106807	@SarahforHD134 @RealCedricDark I don't spend a great deal of time on anti-vax message boards—because I don't hate myself—but does anyone happen to know what their stance is on the potential COVID-19 vaccine?Are they planning to take it/let their kids take it?
105699	One reason I am not that afraid of antivaxxers on the coronavirus is because I think there are going to be lots of vaccine mandates at schools, airlines, employers, etc. Anti-vaxxers are going to end up having the get the shots.
105239	Could someone explain to me why  I'm not excited  about the covid-19 Vaccine  why am I laughing  that this shit ain't  going to work
107234	and still that might not be enough bc there is a large swath of Americans saying they won't get the vaccine and might render herd immunity impossible
107426	"So it's going to be safe for ""student athletes"" (football only mind you) to return to campus, but the scholarship student that may be able to help discover a vaccine for Covid-19 in a campus lab isn't?@NCAA @CBSNews @espn @Espngreeny @stephenasmith @GetUpESPN @joeovies @AGoldFan"
201514	@CPH2021 I have a paper COVID-19 vaccination card indicating my name, date of birth, the type of vaccine I got (Pfizer), location of vaccine and dates of doses.
105901	Idiots who refuse the coronavirus vaccine for no good reason should be restricted to their houses like in Austria. We need to let people with cancer get proper treatment instead of being side-lined due to disease ridden vaccine refusers.
105651	@cheri_rotruck Besides that they say the vaccine has some kind of DNA properties that will affect your DNA so why would you want to take the vaccine the word I heard is when you go get tested for covid-19 there is a chemical in that Q-tip what causes cancer in your body
105329	This is madness. No vaccine can be  developed in 6 months and declared safe in days.If you are stupid enough to let them inject you with this you deserve everything you get
201795	@GovMikeDeWine Hey #AntiVaxx people and #AntiCovid people. I am two weeks into my #Moderna #COVID19 #Vaccine and I still only have 10 fingers, 10 toes, 2 arms, 2 legs, 1 head, not a zombie, no change in my dna or any, not sterile, and still functioning just fine. Get a clue #VaccinesAreSafe
106890	"It's 100% factual they're using placebos and I've also seen ""Fact Checkers"" saying that it isn't an experimental vaccine trial. It is.If the pandemic was so dangerous and vax so safe, why are they giving Placebos?Maybe they know the adverse reactions would be huge.Think..."
107581	@OrdinaryMadn3ss @Nmenon777 That's fine to Wuhan coronavirus has an approximate 99.6% survival rate. They never plan on everyone not getting the virus. They planned on not flooding hospitals with coronavirus cases and creating a vaccine for those that it may be necessary for.
107283	This was a huge mistake made by Russia. More than half the population won't get the vaccine because their vaccine was out so soon and did not have large testing trials to see if there were any problems with it.
107029	ANYTHING RELATED TO THIS LAB-DISEASE IS FUNNY...ALL THE BRANDS MARKETED SO FAR ARE NOT UNIVERSAL IN OTHER WORDS PFIZER VACCINE CAN NOT BOAST THE IMMUNE SYSTEM OF AFRICANS OR EITHER WAY SINOPHARM VACCINE IS HARMFUL TO EUROPEANS...WHAT A HELL FOR THOSE WHO STILL BELIEVED THERE ANY
107613	"What ARE they hiding.  If one goes on the Janssen website, as I did yesterday, and click on "" For Health Professionals"" all is well spelled out.  Trial info.  The ugly is especially there.  They are transparent.  No one is talking about injecting  PEG in the MrNA vaccines."
106069	Trump's briefing, if he has such a good feeling about vaccine, maybe he s/b a willing volunteer to try the vaccine first! @PeterAlexander you are a great journalist! You are a honorable man, @realDonaldTrump is not! He's choosing this time to attack journalists who call him out!
105680	Okay, I get it We can't do anything about the migrant crisis but where is the Vaccine for this Virus!?#COVID19 #Corona
106499	You keep going on @newsmax telling people these vaccines are safe.  How the hell do you know that? If they are so safe why has Big Pharma been giving immunity against lawsuits for people who have suffered adverse effects?  Do you personally know of the LONG TERM EFFECTS?...1/4
105989	@multibleron @flyviz @indepdubnrth That is true but you miss the point, rushed vacines are not safe if coronavirus vacines were straight forward then we would have one for other Coronavirus 30%of colds are caused by Coronavirus there's no vaccine for SARS CoV1 mers CoV
107600	@IngrahamAngle Well, I worry coronavirus may pick up speed. I am going to vote for person with best administrative skills and experience, Bloomberg, that could mobilize supplies, vaccines, health personnel as stores close, hospitals fill, and fear spreads due to possible coronavirus pandemic
105846	2 national treasures for the price of 1! If you get offered a vaccine, please for the love of all that is good take it! #COVID19 #vaccine #COVIDVaccine
201644	On September 27, 2021, I received the 2nd #Pfizer Vaccination, the side effect that was experienced was only pain in the arm after the injection.  How to Relieve Pain from Vaccine Injections that I did was to compress warm water, not long after it returned to normal.#COVID19
107637	"@BrentHodgson Eventually, everyone will need to develop immunity against COVID-19 and there are only two ways to do so - get the jab or get infected. Spread  of coronavirus is ""necessary"" in order for everyone to develop immunity."
106940	This is a SARS based virus. So, you know its not found yet a vaccine for SARS, they found only a treatment. I don't want to say bad news to good people, but I'm not hopefull for Covid19 vaccine. #vaccine, #coronavirus
106311	@Justaguefan @ToothpasteWords Yeah if HCQ worked for a stronger coronavirus in Sars, you would think it would for Covid-19. But the pharmaceuticals won't make a profit from it like they would from vaccines.
107372	@VaclavRomanov @PokerPolitics Dogs piss on trees? Maybe that's the answer to the Coronavirus vaccine.   I think I got it now.
106226	Fuck. All. These. Idiots. Honestly, any dumbass protester who gets in the way of me getting a life saving vaccine is going to be on the wrong end of a HUGE amount of pent up pandemic rage. #FAAFO
105252	@htTweets#cancelcompartment1. Students got compartment only in one subject.2. Students failed by very few marks.3. Coronavirus cases still increasing with precautions,no vaccine yet.4. We are stressed and depressed. 5. Students who did not appear for exams get promoted.
106293	"@sailorrooscout You should go on @LindseyMastis's ""Coronavirus Alert Desk"" Program, Explain why MU is not vaccine resistant and talk about the Fold-Reduction studies! You would be the voice of reason..."
107503	@d3_valenzuela @llovesparks @KenDilanianNBC What I’m saying is the rooster is coming home to roost on the vaccine. The scientists told us over a year ago that in animal trials they observed antibody dependent enhancement which means when you come in contact with a wild coronavirus your immune system overreacts. 1/2
107553	@PhillyD Maybe they don’t work has anyone considered that it’s experimental and we have never had a vaccine for a coronavirus just saying 🤦‍♂️
106613	"All for ""COULD"" huh ?In that case I'm not taking a vaccine because it ""COULD"" harm me.I'm not downloading the covid app @ScottMorrisonMP because they ""COULD"" use the information to abuse my rights.I ""COULD"" go on forever."
107150	@BBCRealityCheck @AdamRutherford @FryRsquared I don’t know if this is valid question but whilst a vaccine for coronavirus is being developed, would there be any benefit to giving all or some vulnerable people a pneumonia jab? Potentially try to reduce effect if it was contracted?
201614	Heading out to get my second shot! I’m excited and deeply grateful to the scientists who created the vaccine, the medical staff administering it, and all the people patiently waiting to be immunized. #VaccinateNY #Vaccinate #COVID19 #Covid19Vaccine #NY
105690	Coronavirus vaccine coming out Tuesday. My home lab is a mess right now but it’s coming along nicely, just need a couple more hours in the oven for a nice even bake. I’m sure that the president will be happy to hear that the vaccine will got to the highest bidder on eBay.
106248	This pandemic will not be over until it’s over for everyone, everywhere. I’m calling on @Novavax to pledge their commitment to making sure the COVID-19 vaccine is distributed fairly and equitably around the world. #OneWorldProtected
106037	@joey_sasso @kanyewest Good point.. Kanye is against vaccines.Sheeple need to take a step back and realize the never-been-done-in-mass-before Moderna mRNA COVID19 vaccine electronically injects genetic material into your cells. Think Monsanto. We're the guinea pigs.Don't believe me? Research.
106126	@KXAN_News @averytravistv Yes, Avery Travis I used the system due to me getting the two stage coronavirus vaccine in March &amp; April and not having a great experience  with the coronavirus vaccines. Great job Avery Travis on your news story and thanks for posting this news update on the coronavirus vaccine.
106068	I keep a photo of my negative PCR results on my phone.  And I'll add my Moderna shot card when I can get the second jab.  Not everyone has easy access to 'their doctor'.  Do private practice clinicians have access to their state's vax database, like medical groups do?
105958	Mishap? Thats the whole reason people are there...to get a vaccine. Thats not a mishap, that's manipulation
106418	The #Oxford coronavirus #vaccine successfully provokes a strong immune response, an analysis has found.
106844	You all need to be asking why? Why push this vaccine that only lessens symptoms and has no long term safety data. Why? What's in it?
107293	@Charles_Castle_ @newzjunkey @RexChapman What gets me is how they make it out to be such a BFD, when it's not.Bad reactions to the vaccine are miniscule; bad reactions to COVID-19 are over 730,000.
106741	I don't understanding why they don't say the naturally infected individuals don't need to take the vaccine and save these doses to others that need it?6 months immunity if you were infected or you took the vaccine (same).
106635	Mark my words. There is a sh*t storm in humanities way when people will get vaccinated with this trial vaccine. Especially the kids will suffer in long term cases. #COVID19 #Omicron
106062	just saw an infographic about how to confront someone who doesn’t want to get the covid-19 vaccine. y’all are INSUFFERABLE
106942	Just like the flu mutates and strains change every year (why they make a new vaccine every year) so is/does/will the Coronavirus. Move on. Open the Country. Lets get on with life!
201626	Love it, @DanielAndrewsMP …but would’ve loved it even more if I hadn’t had my booster last month! 🤣 A big step up from the mere lollipop @mjrowland68 and I had hoped for…😂
105514	Life would be so much better without: Vaccine passports. Required testing with nasal swabs and throat swabs. Required masking.Do you really want to live your entire life this way? SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus. It’s not going anywhere—despite what arrogant scientists say.
106010	When the time comes—unless you CANT get the vaccine for medical reasons—I don’t want you to talk to me again if you REFUSE IT.#DisabilityVisibility #DisabilityRights #DisabledNotDisposable
106770	@ffweekend how is it you're OK with mandatory vaccines (MMR etc.) for kids going to school yet you are outraged when it comes to businesses and schools mandating the covid-19 vaccine???#hypocrite
106737	I've asked this question before so...If the COVID-19 vaccine, ada elemen tak halal dalamnya, would you as a Muslim take it or not?
105759	Must watch video if you’re weighing up having the vaccine. Ive already made my decision. It’s not about anti-vaccine or pro-vaccine, it’s about what’s right for humanity.
106642	@discu55 @StinaJoy @ThePatrickFranz @NerdyMom1202 @business You don't understand bumkiss, you say it would be boring if we were all the same, yet you want people that have had Covid19 &amp; no symptoms to take a vaccine that doesn't protect against it or keep you from spreading it, but only lessens the symptoms.You've been fear mongered.
106629	@burnett_cain @riseupmelbourne They haven’t got a vaccine for the most common coronavirus in history(the common cold) yet they’ve got one for this. Are people actually swallowing this shit. In the U.K. we’ve been told the ‘second wave’ may hit this winter. Who didn’t see that coming.
105811	@DerekDenhamAlan @DPrabhata @maggiemfox @jechristensen @TAWaldrop You think pneumonia can’t scar the lungs and also cause long term problems? COVID is a new coronavirus but it’s not alien technology. No one knows if there are any long term effects of the virus or the vaccine.
106399	@JUANFENNSKI @BBCBreakfast @MattHancock we will get vaccine for covid-19 (to reduce symptoms only of SARS COVID-2) so no virus would be eliminated !!! what a scam!!!
201740	Today is a great day to get either your:• First vaccine dose (only ~63% of my age group in SK has)• Second vaccine dose (only ~48% of my age group in SK has)The unvaccinated are the reason for the variants. Y’all are little varient factories.
106042	Can’t even have fun on Earth during a once in a lifetime pandemic anymore. Lorrrrrddddd, stop being so fatphobic! Nobody’s eating a donut everyday because they got a vaccine..... 😑
107240	This is AWESOME news on the same day that I got my first COVID-19 vaccine. This is an epic deluxe cover of the already beautiful album that is LOVE IS AN ART.
106087	Well, it's settled with my boss. I am going to the no appointment needed FEMA site tomorrow before work to get covid-19 vaccine #1. They are closing the site to first vaccines after tomorrow and I don't want to fight trying to get an appointment. They will make appt for shot 2.
107300	@NetworksManager It’s more sinister. Covid19 “vaccine” is going to be administered like this to the people who would NOT take the shot voluntarily.
106176	@realDonaldTrump You’re so worried about banning an app when all this commotion is going on in the world, and you haven’t even found a vaccine for COVID-19 🙄your pathetic
106729	"It takes years to develop a safe vaccine. Either they already had one developed (nothing shocks me anymore) or they're bypassing all safety protocols to have this ""vaccine"" cranked out so quickly. Both sides of the political isle are sheep being led to the slaughter. SMH"
106877	I am so tired of the insanity happening in the US. I am totally open to learning that HCQ is protective against Covid, but articles like this totally discredit their own objectives by making statements like “Dr. Fauci who is an investor in the Wuhan Lab and the COVID-19 vaccine”
106456	@latimes Trying to make sense of ppl like this. Four questions:Were these ppl and others of their persuasion given a trial vaccine in private to see if it will work?Do they believe they are immune to COVID19?Do they just don't care?Are they under a strong evil delusion, seriously?
201611	I have lots of FRIENDS and FAMILY that have taken the COVID-19 Vaccine and all had the SAME EXPERIENCE. NO SIDE EFFECTS AT ALL.THIS IS THE TRUTH.The VACCINE will help us end this pandemic. IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET VACCINATED.PLEASE DO
105895	I don't even like to take the flu vaccine because of it making me sick for a few days. If this Covid-19 vaccine is offered to me? I'll take it on camera. What's a few days of symptoms compared to the grave?!
107172	@Jose_Freitas94 @realistgeo @KokeUSG It has nothing to do with COVID-19 and probably isn’t true in regards to any vaccine. I think at this point we can’t just believe everything we see in the internet
106786	How is the government still promoting something that’s not #FDA approved then if you do get vaccinated you still can catch  #COVID19  why not create a vaccine for #cancer #diabetes  #hiv #aids
201517	The man who got COVID last week and said it was mild *specifically because* he got vaccinated has now banned vaccine mandatesWhat an absolute fucking idiot
106049	@irenegarth1946 Every person without vaccine protection is a potential incubator for a new variant! This virus is able to evolve swiftly to survive. If we want a normalised world we have to get ahead of #COVID19 not just patching up after it! We can beat it if we stop politicising it!
201787	Grateful to the scientists and all involved for working so hard to produce this vaccine 👍🏽👏🏽 #MondayThoughts
105255	Just got my COVID-19 vaccine. No microchip detected. Didn’t have to renounce Christ. And everyone was really nice.
107136	I am starting to think there will be games again without fans after reading of so many catching Covid19 new variant at this rate we will be lucky if fans can go2games on December 26/27th.I have had my booster but it doesnt stop1 getting Covid 19 only reduces how bad you get it.🤦‍♂️
106803	If they mandate #Florida kids to go back to school I am going to decline that offer. No vaccine, no school. We'll homeschool.
105641	i hope this COVID-19 vaccine works with others because i’m not putting something that we’re still experimenting with, inside my body. i don’t really feel like being a human test subject.
105935	They actually were going to hype Santa in their vaccine pitch( hmmm... was this just advertising for their stock investment)🤔🤔
201546	@6abc @6abc the segment you just aired about the Dr. who just got the first Covid19 vaccine shot and then a few days later tested positive for Covid was completely irresponsible reporting. That Dr. did not yet develop full immunity or receive the 2nd shot... 1/3
106823	I'm in favor of getting the #COVID19 vaccine, i just wish our #Governments would be honest about the side effects. Telling an alcoholic out there that the vaccine may not fully work is NOT going to encourage them to GET the vaccine. There are RIPPLES to things that you say &amp; do.
106164	"@CoondogHog @ArkansasCovid This is really wrong headed.Considering that there may be no ""herd immunity"" with COVID19 we all need to do our part until there's vaccine, not just shelter those most at risk.BTW I take offense at the word weak! Fighting off cancer, being 65+, having asthma is not weak. 😣"
107162	Now that we’ve vaccinated the elderly &amp; those with certain conditions, just f’ng give anyone who wants a vaccine a vaccine already. They’re just getting stale &amp; thrown out.I’m mad because I just found out my brother contracted COVID-19 so close to the end of the tunnel.
201674	The Ontario government is further accelerating the second dose interval for individuals who received their first dose of an AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine to eight weeks from 12 weeks.
106898	The other reason I am sharing is that there is so much misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. I am chronicling my experience so others can see the account of a person they know.
107396	With #COVID19 spreading like wild fire this is the last thing we need. Rich countries should share the #vaccine with others to reach the immunity. If not we will live with this for a long time. #VaccineEquity #vaccineforall #coronavirus
107515	Just imagine how many diseases would’ve been cured if academia and industry from all over the world collaborated to take on diseases such as Cancer, Alzheimer and HIV to name a few same as they’ve done with COVID-19 vaccine. Cancer will not be cured by  a research group..1/2
105379	@darryn_briggs @chrislhayes It will NEVER be over.  COVID-19 is a coronavirus, and like all of its fellow coronaviruses, it is now permanently endemic.  And no, vaccines won't stop that, humans aren't the only reservoir, there are multiple animal hosts to the virus as well.
201689	Ended my semester by getting my second #CovidVaccine. I am indebted to the scientists and healthcare workers who have been working so hard. Thank you to @moderna_tx and @WillCoHealth for both doses.Do your part… remember to #WearAMask and #GetVaccinated to fight #COVID19! https://t.co/IuANI7051F
106634	@CBSLA It’s not a “confirmed COVID-19 case”. It’s a continued case of stupidity because some decided not to get the wildly available vaccine. All the vendors will be out cash because someone doesn’t believe in science.
106904	This is my issue. I have vaccinated my daughter but this Covid-19 vaccine is very new and I am concerned about the speed it jas been produced so I will not be rushing to take it.
106241	"Just wait until they start telling kids to turn in their parents for not taking them to get the jab.How many kids will use this ""threat"" to get ______?How long until CPS is called on parents who don't get their kids jabbed?Think this can't happen? History says yes it can."
105282	Every time I see someone who is not a doctor, immunologist, etc. comment negatively on the COVID-19 vaccine, I’m going to figure out what they do for work and make very uneducated comments about their profession. Stay tuned.
105706	Having just spent hours researching, I'm concerned there has never been a vaccine for ANY coronavirus! I did see many 'happy-talk' reports that PROMISE a vaccine but know promises usually melt away like pockets of snow.
107674	Anyone want to go raid a pharmaceutical factory for the COVID-19 vaccine and give it out to hospitals for free?
107520	For all the long term good your vaccines do @sajidjavid you might as well be pedalling Snake Oil. Everything seems to suggest the vaccines are actually getting in the way of natural immunity. This could come back and haunt us 😡
106790	@SRomanum @BNODesk Remember there is no vaccine for the common cold (a normal Coronavirus) at all. It's been 30 years and we don't have an HIV vaccine.  There may never be a vaccine.
106251	They don’t care about the biggest killer “abortion” in the black communities nor about police killing us but they somehow care ENOUGH so that we don’t die from a plandemic. If we don’t take the vaccine and everyone else does then they should be protected from us then right🤔?
105510	My goodness I can’t wait until they approve #covid vaccines for children. Always nerve wracking to have my kids get covid tests when they have a runny nose. If you’re still hesitant, get #vaccinated. It’s not just for you but for the kids too young to get the vaccine. #COVID19
105936	"The ""% of available"" doesn't seem like a good metric, given that vaccines are shipped in huge boluses and vaccination occurs steadily over time. They're not going to get all of a shipment injected the day it arrives and then sit around doing nothing until the next one."
106129	I remember when I went to get my first dose of the vaccine and they told me to come back in a week because they “had no stock”
105487	"If you can't sue an industry that has zero liability...Who do we get to sue if we have a ""bad reaction,"" to this vaccine that was rushed through testing and can't possibly have been studied long enough to know any long term side effects, and particularly any reproductive risks?"
105932	So prisoners are getting vaccines before proper civilians...so I'm thinking if you get arrested for not wearing a mask, you might get vaccinated...#COVID19 #COVIDSecondWave
107309	even if the vaccine worked as intended, Covid was more deadly and there were 0 risk it would still be immoral to mandate it. This isn't something I'm willing to compromise on, I decide my own risk tolerance, the government does not get to do it for me. #COVID19
106879	I really would love to know how many Americans are going to take the coronavirus vaccine? I’ll say a prayer for you! They’ll try to inject your kids while they are at school. WARN YOUR KIDS NOT TO TAKE ANY SHOTS IN SCHOOL. THEY WILL LIE TO YOUR KIDS TO INJECT THEM
201555	My entire family got vaccinated in a week's time as soon as the vaccine reached my locality. Couldn't be prouder to be an Indian. Thank you @narendramodi ji❤️ @balbir59 @ramnikmann @COVIDNewsByMIB #COVID19 #Covishield #vaccine
106210	What I really need now is to become wealthy, do you have a vaccine against poverty (POVAX-21) 😁😆😁 This another free humour!

201677	@LizzyKiane @blankslate2017 @washingtonpost @Rick_Neal The side effects for me were mild. I needed to get the booster and had no side effects at all. #GetVaccinatedNow don’t wait. My sister’s entire family is #Vaxxed and they all got #COVID19 but their symptoms were mild. My dad was #Unvaccinated and he died of #COVID in March.
105394	@HFarhat3 @fifimurray2 The part where you refuse to take the COVID-19 vaccine. I feel like this isn't hard to understand. You might not like the label, but you're still an antivaxxer.
107575	If Harvard opts out, kiss the Ivy League goodbye until the coronavirus vaccine is found.Being a conference that believes more in academics and science than athletics, if Harvard opts out of winter sports, the rest of the Ivy League will follow suit.
107304	This is why getting your vaccine is so important, folks.  We can save lives.#ThisIsOurShotWI #BrighterTomorrow2022
106081	In the middle of the protests everyone forgot about coronavirus. Soon the second wave of coronavirus will be announced and they will put everyone on even more strict lock-down and then vaccinate everyone. #coronavirus #COVID19 #vaccine
106580	We need to band together and fight off this virus like we did the British.Our best weapon is the Vaccine and wartime patriotism. I've already got 2 SHOTS in my arm.I'm part of The Herd 🇺🇸Who's with me? 🙌
106812	@SteveDeaceShow @Happy_Hunter58 Exactly right, the vaccine is for the vulnerable; not everyone! This has been turned in a weapon of fear like masks that don’t work. #COVID19
105376	@RudyGiuliani We know you are owned Rudy. Warp speed had nothing to do with COVID-19 vaccine (pathetic to try and rename it in such a racist way) development. WS is responsible for distribution only and that's not going well is it? Your time is coming Rudy and your corruption will be known!
106663	So @BillGates will take the coronavirus vaccine publicly on camera but some loser anti-vaxxers like Haifa Wehbe and Carol Samaha  speak against it. Maybe they should stick to gold digging in Egypt.
105562	#COVID19  You either shut down person to person contact or you develop a vaccine, or you take the #Republicans approach. Sacrifice american lives to keep the economy going and hope it goes away on it's own.
105470	My teacher spouse and I are vaxxed and boosted, my elder kid is vaxxed but my 3 year old isn't so jokes on him, right?
107291	@bidenWinning @ABC Because idiot, those are actually vaccines for deadlier diseases. This is a quickly made up placebo to try and control people. They can't and won't force them on flu shots. Well guess what, seasonal flu is A FUCKIN CORONAVIRUS.
105404	"The #covid19 situation in my confused head:""You should stay home, but then don't if you want (which you should), but go out because work, since this a really dangerously harmless fatal desease actually for our economy. We have vaccines now. You're unemployed. Get vaccinated."""
107387	them have died? Vaccines work, but nothing is 100% perfect, never has been. Those who choose not to get vaccinated, remember if you get sick it is no ones fault but your own. If you get Covid19 and infect a love one who isn't vaccinated the result is on you.  We are3/4

105944	Too much suppression may mean not enough herd immunity so suppression will continue until morale improves/vaccine is widely available.
107448	@AngrierWHStaff Do you believe the coronavirus vaccine timing is political? Do you think the FDA will tow the line or put their foot down if it's not ready?
106186	@narendramodi Hello SHRI NARENDRA MODI, My Name is Rohit Sadhoo, I am 14 year old boy requesting for a Covid-19 Vaccine that can be given to childrens. I am saying because after doing several online classes ,I want to attend my classes In my school, so please give vaccines to childrens.
106851	I’m not a medical professional so I defer to med professionals on issues like this. My wife is a medical professional so I subsequently know many people in the field.The arguments I’ve heard against young healthy people taking the vaccine outweigh the arguments for taking it.
201714	Got vaccinated &amp; feeling grateful to #NHS #astrazeneca #MaryleboneGP #TheUniversityofOxford All went smoothly, well organised from registering to getting vaccinated. A beautiful &amp; historical location too - had my Covid19 jab next to Shakespeare’s sculpture in #WestminsterAbbey ! https://t.co/PU3tuNELy2
201637	I had my flu vaccine and looking forward to my COVID-19 booster as I'm 28 weeks pregnant 🤰and want to protect me and my baby👶 and enjoy the last bit of pregnancy, rather than be ill #ImmunityBoosted
105769	Dude, we're not going to defeat CovidWe're just going to get vaccinated and protect ourselves as best we canUntil a variant comes along that goes around the vaccineBecause IDIOTS WON'T WEAR MASKS OR GET SHOTS
105344	I trust the President!  The vaccine we all need to worry about is the one Bill Gates has been working on for 20 years and coordinating with China.
106285	@davidkurten What do you think vaccines do? Seeing as the 131,000 people who have died of Covid-19 in the UK also had immune systems, why do you think trusting one's immune system is an argument against getting vaccinated?
107231	Graham says - Get the vaccine, if you don’t want to die, very simple. However, Graham STILL won’t confess he supported evil DT LIES about the election. Psalms 101:7“No one who practices deceit   shall dwell in my house;no one who utters lies  shall continue before my eyes.”
107627	@AnthonyNBC12 4 or 5 I think?  And got my 2nd Pfizer vaccine yesterday.  But still gonna wear the mask(s) and test as needed. #coronavirus
105442	This is so critical given our current predicament (no organized plan in the U.S.) &amp; unreal effort it'll take to globally scale a vaccine. Trace, test, isolate to get cases low (did not happen in U.S.); develop therapies to speed recovery, reduce mortality; vaccine to prevent.
106018	Question:Why does the president show no interest in taking the vaccine jab?This could have really inspired the rest of the population on COVID-19 vaccines.Is there something we don't know?Have you noticed the bigwigs no longer mask up?
106872	People saying the #coronavirus is going to be gone in May are delusional. We are just going to have more tests, hospital beds, and preventative measures in place. This will not end until we have a vaccine.
107188	If you get any of these vaccines there's a 100% (+-) chance that you will survive a coronavirus infection.
107328	#Sinopharm uses one of the 'classic' #vaccine techniques, with an inactivated #CoronaVirus. Q: where did they get all that virus material from?
107455	No it's not stunning. As a person who watched their dumbass governor fumble the initial response to COVID-19 and then be re-elected just in time to fumble the vaccine roll-out, it's not stunning. Having to deal with the death cult GOP's stronghold on my state is terrible
107226	Except there's no vaccine yet, so how they know the size of the stockpile is anybody's guess...It's because they're lying. That's it. That's the guess.

107380	"👍👍 if it's effective as the admin want to put it, there would be no need to force people to take it. the manufacturers have conspired with Governments all over the world to use people as guinea pigs for this COVID-19 vaccine. it  ""will take years and failures"" to develop it."
106346	@sarashallx @MonicaGandhi9 What brakes? This is a very new field and it's not going to end anytime soon. I'm hearing universal coronavirus vaccine, and cancer vaccine development. Now I have every reason to root for a cancer vaccine, but if they're going to be this pushy for all of them... no thanks.
105658	@ShaneGrover2 @truthqst @TheLastSquatch @RealCandaceO Ok so do you get a seasonal flu shot?  I hope not because there is less data in each annual flu vaccine than 15+ months of Covid-19 vaccine.
106313	We all need to work together to protect the world from #COVID19. Will @g20org states please step up and release much needed funds for response efforts to @WHO @CEPIvaccines and @gavi? Together, we can beat this pandemic.
106655	@mhdksafa I fully understand mRNA vaccination and I fully understood the all out efforts made to developing the COVID-19 vaccine. I am 58 yo and I am an  bc educator in a 1900+ student school. As soon as my state made my group eligible, I registered for my vaccination. I’m still preaching!

107641	My sincere hope is that Cuba will make their COVID-19 vaccine available to the world in every possible way: Producing it themselves, sharing the knowledge needed to produce it, and helping set up production everywhere it can possibly be made.

201676	Yesterday I worked at the vaccination centre, so nice to see so many happy people eager to get their COVID-19 vaccine. Some this was their first outing since March 2020!
105724	@200belligerents @ZubyMusic In the UK we have reached a point where most people know someone who has died, or has long long term illness. It is not a trivial illness. Relative to the risks from COVID19, the vaccine is very safe indeed. Despite all that, no one is being forced to take the vaccine.
107158	@starsandstripes Will there be a vaccine for the new strain of coronavirus?  I mean, it’s a virus, and they do mutate, just like influenza.
106829	South Africa is not a poor nation and shouldn't get #coronavirus vaccines donations like countries like Zimbabwe. Our economy is too big to be in this situation. Our government is not competent. That is where the biggest problem is
107195	Following the news that a coronavirus vaccine is 90% effective, would you get the vaccine? I’m interested to see your responses and reasons, so if you’re yes or no let me know your thoughts!
105452	@thievinganc @pierredevos @MRCza @DrZweliMkhize Mkhize is gambling with our lives, and in a functional state he would be tried for contravening the Coronavirus regulations and guidelines. He had to be reminded to act on procuring the vaccine like it was not to logical next step.
105328	Considering people with highly allergic reactions shouldn't take the Pfizer vaccine, what can folks like me take? @ASlavitt, is there any word on an alternative for the allergic among us? As someone with asthma as well, I'd like to know what's safe/is Moderna my answer? Thanks!
107624	@russellbrandom @jstephencarter @ConceptualJames And you’re ignoring that the viruses you mentioned don’t have animal reservoirs like COVID-19 and influenza. Viruses with AR can go host in other species , mutate, and come back as a new variant and render your vaccine useless. It’s my we have the flu every year, but not polio et
107535	I'm listen to BBC World Service idiot doctor on saying the only way across the world they can control the virus is with the vaccine but we have been told categorically does not stop you catching coronavirus and does not stop you spreading it so he's talking out of his ass

106822	@atlaspurred @sander7211 @eugyppius1 We still don't have a 100% effective vaccine for humans for ANY coronavirus. This is why the Gates foundation has funded the Universal Flu vaccine, as an attempt to help wipe it out. You have to look at SARS Cov-2 and remember it's not smallpox. You aren't going to knock it out
105502	Be prepared to fight this one. Mandatory vaccine - tracer? No way in hell will I submit this to this. God Bless, Kevin Thank you for all you are doing for us.
105375	My comment on tonight's question time is.While the vaccine is rolled out nationwide are patients in hospital who are Positive with COVID-19 receiving the vaccine and if No they why not ?From Ted in Essex #bbcqt
105747	“I got my COVID vaccine last week. Just like we always talked about. Cuz you were so excited for me to drive COVID cases out.”
107057	Minister Farrakhan just spoke And he said that if they come out with a vaccine for the Coronavirus black people should not run out and get that vaccine.
107135	@Woodhead85 @The_DogWalker @JayMitchinson We were fortunate that if we had to have a pandemic, it would be a coronavirus, something a first year med student would learn about. Tonnes of research had already gone on into SARS and MERS and specifically a MERS jab. Cancer is a wide and varied field, this was one big target.
107331	This is starting to convert me into an @ATabarrok disciple on drug/vaccine approvals. Why do we have to wait till May for this in the U.S.? (Has seemingly fewer adverse reactions than Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer too)
107620	This happened on my 2nd Year of Medical School! Even did my research and came up with Ebola diagnostic method and Vaccination 💉.5) Next, now Coronavirus comes...did my research on treatment and vaccines and praying 🧎‍♂️ to God. I do have faith knowing God always protects.

107465	@savoes16 @HarenThe1 @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump Just imagine how many people would die from the flu if we didn't have vaccine to protect them and hold those numbers back. We have NO vaccine, and NO definitive test or treatment for coronavirus yet. You like to play Russian Roulette?
105543	@FuflunsPW @chrischirp That’s the interesting bit.  Cold virus have remained prevalent so the NPIs effective for flu less effective for colds and Covid - both coronavirus.Is it the flu vaccine that makes the difference.  Doesn’t really explain the 0.0% in surveillance in normally peak weeks.
105281	@DrSamGirgis I don't believe we know enough about COVID-19 to have an effective vaccine. I'll rely on my immune system until more is known. Anyone know where I can get a black market COVID-19 vaccine certificate so I can go back to work? 😎
106060	Part 59 in our #Covid19 vaccine drama. So. The absent father has now filed two fresh motions against us. One, to remove the chile from us for abuse because we vaxxed the kid. Two, to prevent the second vax. He already lost this in court but he won’t give up. 1/2 #NewMexico
105307	@Av8tor172 @IngrahamAngle It works for Malaria and Rheumatism but probably not for Covid19. So if everyone buys this shit what happens with the people who really need it? You get the problem right? You don't want a new vaccine tested on yourself but you want to use a drug without clinical testing?
106422	@HughGnu yer i dont know past my pay grade twitter ple what is a vaccine ?? are what we are calling vaccines re #COVID19 true vaccines is it like the drugs you take to prevent aids once you get hiv or is like the measles vaccine should we calling these things vaccines ?
106882	@BeschlossDC @bjaninemorison Republicans just don’t care if their corruption. is on display. The thing I can’t believe is there’s 437K COVID19 deaths, 1,000’s very sick, in financial straits, vaccines need to get out, budgets need to be worked out and he’s running to trump.
106038	@DanielJHannan Suppression until vaccine is not a fair prospect.It is not sensible nor even warranted, given the low IFR of Covid19Please don't defend this madness
106881	Don't do this often, but we've worked with the City in organizing an accessible vaccine clinic for people with disabilities. If you know someone that would be eligible, please share widely. #vaccineequity

106947	They can read the tea leaves: Coronavirus has got everyone distracted until there's a vaccine. Trump is a paper tiger who can't manage his way out of a brunch, much less reinvigorate alliances that he's helped strain; but he may be gone in 7 months. /2
107252	@FireyTopaz @politico Nah. Everyone could wear a mask and Coronavirus would still spread like it is. The masks either work or they don't, just like the vaccines.
105592	@PinkSkyMagazine @CaraMia200 Will there be room for discussion when they come up with a vaccine for Coronavirus? Are you really going to say no?
106718	@ChillinskyKris @CharlieViggiano @RealCandaceO @WholeFoods Influenza has a vaccine.  Coronavirus does not.  That's the difference.  If it spreads to everyone, everyone gets sick.  If you get the flu, but you also had your vaccine, you'll be fine.
107129	“We failed on the social science.” Who would’ve thought a safe and effective vaccine wouldn’t be attractive to 30% of the population?
106478	#covid19 If a healthcare workers can go to work, COVID positive why do you mandate a vaccine to protect the patients when you are allowing the health care workers to knowingly expose patients to the virus?
201597	Got my Covid booster yesterday. Feel cruddy today, so my body's been fooled into thinking I have Covid (again), and defending me. Go, antibodies! Can say from experience it's still a lot better than actually having Covid, and will be over much faster.#COVID19 #vaccinated
201600	My Granny had her first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine today and honestly I'm the happiest I've been since March
107189	That’s the news we are all hoping for... except for stocks like zoom and peleton ... everyone else is feeling this 😂 low key I’m going to wait on the vaccine until version 2.0 comes out.
106862	@drdavidsamadi @Shanesoup1 So I have given up on getting people to stop taking vaccines. I won’t take one but I can help them and their kids get safe ones! We must help the world pivot to non mRNA no spike@protein traditionally made vaccines like #Covaxin it is @WHO approved with 150mdoses w/o side effects
106830	Absolutely.  Vaccines in general are no good.  But, to rush it then try to force it people is scary.  They won't find out til later that there are problems and terrible side effects from the vaccine.  Not to mention, Bill Gates is pushing it...THAT is terrifying!
106927	Clownish, yes, but it's also an important insight into how the media works in 2021.They're not going into that press conference with Murphy chasing a story on botched vaccine distribution or a nursing home death coverup.Their editors want clickbait. They're there to get it.
107176	@JandJFlowers @phossils @TommyMacDC @Nike @Kaepernick7 That is not true! Now there is an effective vaccine out there. Anyone who does not take the vaccine and dies of covid-19 did in fact take responsibility for their own death. Those who discourage others from vaccines are strait up killers.
105896	@WrestleTalk_TV Everybody's in ring career should be over. #coronavirus is going to lead to extinction and entertainment &amp; sporting events are only going to spread it. Vaccine won't save us. Only permanent isolation. It is the key! #BanAllSports#BanAllEntertainment
107593	Unfortunately COVID-19 will get worse because it will gain more strength along with the flu in the winter according to Dr. Fauci, but I hope the vaccine is distributed to people who want it including me because I don't want to get the virus, and spread it to other people
107243	Mid-way through my (vaccinated) bout of COVID-19 my take aways are;- Don't underestimate this virus.- Don't overestimate the vaccine.
106412	This is one of reason why my body does not need drugs and chemicals like #vaccines because it can't assimilate with the human body.Take care of body by eating healthy foods it will take of you without you even noticing.

106926	Folks..understand this..the Coronavirus Vaccine will work..whether you take it or not..the vaccine’s main purpose..will be to allow the media and Democrats to almost immediately stop pretending the shutdown were needed. They were not!
105655	@ChuckWendig Pneumonia is the worst... I've had it twice in the last 5 years... Begged my doctor to give me the vaccine and she will not do it until I'm over 55.
105795	Getting covid in December was my vaccine,  he got the vaccine and still got covid,  and has to quarantine, so tell me, what the hell is the point of getting the vaccine? What's the point?
106542	Nice content and gives a good clarity with all these vaccine options that are out there or soon to be out there.
107107	@ty16097410 @HansDancin @AdamSchefter No the purpose of the vaccines is expose you to elements of the coronavirus so you can build up certain antibodies against the actual contraction of the coronavirus. Yes if you do get the vaccine It may lessen the effects. Truth: we don’t know it’s new virus to the human genome!
106351	We’ve had SARS and MERS before and to my knowledge we couldn’t develop effective vaccines for those. Why is Covid-19 different even though it is a SARS type virus?Or am I wrong here?Thanks!

105749	It will be voluntary, but I you haven't had it you will have to wear a mask when in public until you get the vaccine, they can't force you to get it, but they can and will withhold services if you don't get it..... The Liberal Way !!
107630	"It's because they tested these things beforehand. But people decided ""they rushed it out"" is the narrative because they choose to ignore everything that happened before the vaccine rollout. Like, how coronavirus was being studied before the 2019 variant happened."

201748	MT @ResisterSis1 ”volunteers who received the vaccine made more neutralizing antibodies than have been seen in most patients who have recovered from Covid-19. But a second injection, four weeks after the first, was required before the vaccine produced a dramatic immune response.”
105443	@joelpollak  I don't understand, Biden has ads saying he would take care of coronavirus. But, everything he lists that he would do like speed up vaccine etc, Trump has already done. Trump and media should press Biden specifics on this what exactly he would do different.

They change about every 2.5 months and so a vaccine with not keep up with it never.  Immunity is really people just getting less sick if they were already infected.

105492	@nmanigeria You guys should not sleep over your all important role o. The talk that Nigeria is planning to get covid19 vaccine from China is worrisome, as China did not vaccinate her population in any way to bring the virus under complete control. Stand up for us.
107232	Do we want to face the real possibility of Humanity's extinction?  @potus @secdef @thejointstaff @deptofdefense @who @DrTedros @antonioguterres @UNGeneva everyone wants to live even skull and bone members want life. Vaccines are not the answer Covid-19 is getting stronger..

106731	@siewakes20 @matt_cooper85 @sportbible This might blow your mind but footballers actually did have health problems before the COVID-19 vaccine, just like everyone else in the world 🤦‍♂️
106151	Leo can get fucked. Open it up, anyone who is eligible for a vaccine has had an opportunity to get one, we shouldnt delay any longer when people have their minds made up one way or another RE #COVID19 restrictions
105540	Don't worry ! We have an Australian Billionaire politician deseminating COVID vaccine bullshit like Trump et. al. ! He's the one building the Titanic II in China! I wonder what will sink it? Not an iceberg! Will it be tax evasion/minimisation?
105458	@JHowardBrainMD What is this person even talking about? The great messaging about vaccines is if I got one COVID-19 wasn’t going to kill me or even make me very ill. The restrictions are still in place because of the yet to be vaccinated. Why is this so hard?
201545	Johnson andJohnson Vaccine had Reports of DEATH!Why would anyone want its #Booster?Americans who received Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine should be able to receive a second shot of the vaccine two months after their first dose under an emergency authorization,
106661	It’s gonna work next time guys. They just need to stay home and mask up until we find a better vaccine.
106085	How are the LTC’s still having massive infections? I am sure they are NOT international travellers. What ever happened about your promised iron ring around LTC’s. Get the vaccines in these homes stat.
106937	@HindtTimmy @SandraKM123 @CNNPolitics Funny how CNN changed their coronavirus pandemic ticker to vaccines distributed instead of coronavirus deaths, like it's still not happening.
107506	#RT @JoeBiden: RT @POTUS: The more people that get vaccinated, the faster we will beat this pandemic. That’s why one of my first goals is to administer 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in our first 100 days. I’m proud to say we’re over halfway to our goal and weeks ahead…
105820	@nadhimzahawi @RoyalFamily I’d love to know when my 88 year old mum with underlying health conditions will get hers. This is in B75. Any ideas, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for COVID-19 Vaccine Deployment?
106601	@SuperFastEddie1 @denisemcuevas @Cook33Dalvin So you admit spreading a virus is bad. If you think a flu only takes a few days to get over, you’ve never had the flu. And when we have treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 the way we do for the flu, it will be an equal comparison. Can’t wait for that day.
106185	How are we doing this to our kids LIKE IT'S OK? THIS IS NOT OK.#MaskUp everyone, get the #CovidVaccine if you can, and for the love of whatever god (or none) that you care about, pls @FDA we have to move on the vaccine for kids like it's an EMERGENCY (the E in EUA).
105423	@USATODAY Covid19 vaccines are vaccine in trial,In Just 1st phase has shown that vaccines are not working as intended as vaccines Scientists have to go back to lab and make another vaccine , DON'T USE HUMAN BEING AS YOUR SPECIMEN IN YOUR TRIALS,WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON US
107458	@realDonaldTrump This is how much the Republicans care about America.  Before Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine was proved highly successful, the company offered the Trump admin the chance to lock in supplies but the Trump never made the deal allowing other countries to take its place in line.
107276	@Jc_1978 Well if you’re confident to take the vaccine from psychopathic person that’s ok. The video I put up helps to know him better whether you trust him or notI meant you say there’s no long term vaccine effects but believe in long term cons from virus which is..coronavirus after all
106409	@AnnRudbeck @cliftonaduncan It’s like the flu. The virus will continue to move around the globe &amp; the flu vaccine we receive in North America each year is based on the strain circulating during the winter months in Australia (our summer months). #covid19
106641	"It baffles me every time I hear my peers say ""I don't know what's in the vaccine so I'm not taking it"" My reply-- We've taken well over 7 vaccines since birth without knowing the composition, Covid-19 vaccine isn't any different. Get vaccinated joor!!"
107445	Why are people upset? They were vaccinated. So does this mean vaccines don’t work? Or if they do and getting covid is ok, then why is there any restrictions at all? Makes no sense whatsoever. #covid19 #COVIDIOTS
106484	He needs to be on a ventilator but is refusing because he is afraid he will never wake up.Reminder that getting the vaccine is lower risk than driving on the highway for 0.47 seconds yes I did the actual math.
107631	@NigeriaInfoPH @sparklingoracle Will the vaccine bring to an end of covid19 or we will continue to wear face mask and maintain social distance even after taking the vaccine? Again, my joy is that they will start with the leaders before it gets down to the ordinary people.
106372	@RUSSREBORN i went to my clinic to take my Covid 19 vaccine but now I’m scared, all the vaccines are gone. Coronavirus star player Russell Westbrick took all the shots. he said “i treat my vaccine like I treat the court, i take all the shots”. Whyyy Westbrick. you built my house last week
107269	The Covid19 pandemic is still spreading. The vaccines may or may not work. The chances of not working are higher. The deaths will keep on piling. My estimate of 10 million deaths is likely to be achieved despite the vaccines.
105456	@Dan79596368 You kill me looooooool this is a false equivalence. We don't need COVID-19 vaccines in order to keep our jobs, get an education, buy food, all we need is competency or whatever
106885	I've had my booster and would urge you all to get yours too .. lets do what we can to keep everyone safe !
107514	Oh god. The WhatsApp aunties are gonna be on our ASSES 🥴!! They’re gonna think hot lemonade is the covid-19 vaccine now.
107112	This is why I said take all you can out of me, not doing any good except pain, I am HIV negative which indicates I would be susceptible to influenza/coronavirus which is a cold or flu hence I took Coronavirus vaccine for colds
107125	This is going to complicate things for people claiming to have a “religious exemption” from getting the vaccine, which is great because COVID doesn’t care whether you believe in it or not. It just hopes you’re dumb enough not to get vaccinated so it can take over your lung cells.
107529	@FilmFreeway If they can do that then certainly we must be able to get a proper vaccine for COVID19. Let's get that done &amp; then we can all get back to the theater again...then I'll buy my ticket to see it! 🎬📽🎞💟
105512	@Kinsey73Kinsey @charliekirk11 Coronavirus R&amp;D has been going on for over a decade.Be honest with yourself. You refuse to get the vaccine because you don't like the people who want you to get the vaccine.You people screamed that Dems wanted to prolong Covid, but look who's actually prolonging it.
106849	Isn’t it amazing that when a coronavirus strikes the Western world all stops are pulled out to develop a vaccine against it, but poor countries have had to suffer the devastating impact of malaria for some eternity.#C4News
105977	@JoyAnnReid @donlemon @rolandsmartin @POTUS @VP You're still going to push that lie on us about how effective the vaccine is.
107094	"""expressed concern about the speed with which coronavirus vaccines are being developed. But getting a vaccine approved is only one hurdle. Managing public perception is another, especially if there're concerns about the vaccine being mishandled during transportation and storage."""
105792	If cabinet decides to close schools,for how long will they be closed.I am saying this the coronavirus is going to be around for about 2years while we wait for the vaccine.Finally ,if schools are closed, don't pay the teachers
201759	@DrLeanaWen Lots of folks are in panic mode because they may have taken an Advil hours before the vaccine, as reports are saying the shot could be ineffective. If that is true why no warnings #vaccine #COVID19 No one asked me that when I got my first shot
107545	"THIS. I feel the same. I trust Fauci &amp; science to tell me a vaccine is good to go, NOT the guy who wanted to fire Fauci for saying, ""wear a mask.""Since they've already had the virus, the entire Trump family should get it last? There's ""maybe"" no chance the virus would mutate..."
106650	The so called vaccines don't work against this so supposed new #Moronic variant but I bet my immune system does. Its amazing how good natural immunity is. #WakeUp #covidvariant #coronavirus
105955	Will someone PLEASE explain to Meghan McCain that the vaccine is distributed by each Governor's discretion before she embarrasses herself any further?
106850	Partially resistant to new vaccine- so this “sounds” like it’s hitting the already vaccinated or they’d have not phrased it that way.  Sounds more like the vaccine IS the new variant. But some of us predicted that didn’t we? Pathogenic priming anyone?
201758	Can you imagine the emotional anxiety caused by this? What if you took the J&amp;J vaccine and then the scientists and government officials said that it wasn’t safe? My distrust was warranted.
107045	@jossreimer This is so messed up. First of all, there are only two sexes: male and female; . “Intersex” is NOT A THIRD SEX. Why apologize to the tantrum? Gender identity is a superfluous issue when dealing with #COVID19 vaccines on human biology.
106140	...How many people are going to take the Covid19 vaccine 💉...🤷‍♀️🤔🤔🤔?!...And why are you going to take it /why won’t you take it, if u want to justify your opinion with a tweet ....🤷‍♀️😂😁👍

106354	Survey: if Harry Roque volunteers to get the SinoVac jab FIRST, will that be enough to convince you to get this vaccine?
106895	Basically I'm going to be hoarding different coronavirus vaccines like they were toilet paper four months ago. #inners
106587	When in this world did Bill Gates become an authority on vaccines..if i believe Bill Gates 2021 prediction why should i doubt Trump #COVID19
107463	So if you use a religious exemption to avoid the COVID-19 vaccine, you don't get access to monoclonal antibodies either, since they were involved with aborted fetal cells.  Horse paste enema is your best choice!
105973	As someone who took the COVID-19 vaccine:I will force BOTH my jobs to fire me if they start requiring documentation of vaccines.
106297	"CBS Evening News just reported (very briefly) that AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine trial has been put on hold after an ""unexplained illness"" (or an ""unexpected illness"") in a participant.Pretty sure this is how one of the zombie apocalypse movies/video games started."
107561	@nytimes I feel sorry for anyone that is desperate enough to have poison injected into their body these vaccines are not safe so why the hell are people still getting vaccinated. Coronavirus isn't New it's been here this version was weaponized to be deadly
201732	wrist check /// just got my second covid-19 vaccine. edtwt, are you guys excited for schoollllll?? https://t.co/urJcxJj0nF

106685	Coronavirus is just one example. There are other diseases affecting millions and there will be new diseases in the future. Getting the foundations in place around the world is the best defence. Good nutrition, vaccines, water and sanitation, diagnostics &amp; treatment. For everyone.
107341	I hope 2021 will be better. But I don't think it will be. The 1918 pandemic flu still continues to circulate amongst us today and it took years before the waves subsided. I think the same will happen with this coronavirus. But hopefully the vaccine will make things bearable. 5/n
107358	@HeraldZimbabwe @ChronicleZim @ZTN_News @capitalkfm Is COMVAX an approved vaccine for #COVID19 or is this a typo ?
106238	I just found out today that I get to take the coronavirus vaccine and I am SO EXCITED! Clinicals here I come!
105431	@TheEconomist Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
201755	@fox12oregon Got my random pick to get tested again at work my results came back negative going on 19 or 20th. Time I think still no coronavirus or symptoms still safe and protected without vaccines.
106632	I automatically think less of anyone that went to Oxford University if this I the garbage they were taught... explain to me professor how this super deadly virus that you have to give up your freedom and job for to get the jab will just magically turn into the common cold.
106772	"I think @HamiltonMusical should lean in on the ""I took my shot"" angle when promoting covid-19 vaccines."
106753	@thomaskaine5 And it only takes one person to rekindle the COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak without a vaccine.
105841	"“never before has any attempt to make a coronavirus vaccine been successful, nor has the gene-therapy technology that is mRNA ""vaccines"" been safely brought to market.”"
107596	@sj_ca1867 @wildace @carlyjchalmers @klaidlaw @WIRED Specifically the coronavirus vaccine, obviously, And people without symptoms don’t need tests. You get a “casedemic” when testing everyone as PCR is not an indication of illness.the giver in 2009 decided to stop mass testing of swine flu to stop that casepidemic.
106698	Where are the legal/human rights people etc? Blackmail, coercion, abuse etc supposed to be illegal is it not. What happening over forcing COVID19 vaccines is going to change the world in a very nasty way. I just hope it the bullies that get the hard times &amp; not the victims.
201768	@NototyrannyNOW I got the vaccine, I’m a conservative. I’m glad I got it because I’m exposed  daily to Covid19, but have never gotten sick. Why are you hesitant?
106567	@dazbrady @CenGinLondon @toryboypierce @Keir_Starmer @BorisJohnson @coronavirus so what is government’s responsibility then? when do you hold them to account ffs? why is UK having worst death toll and worst recession at the same time? what did the government do right in this pandemic so far? and don’t say vaccines, thats down to individuals coming forward,
105701	So, to sum up the GOP's current talking points, the coronavirus is a hoax, but if you get sick by it, it's the Democrats' fault. Also, you're paying for your own vaccine.
105975	Let it continue to devastate the families.  I don’t care any more. They had their chance to get the vaccine. The deserve what is coming to them.
106024	@NHarris956 @RexChapman It’s very simple You don’t want to receive the #COVID19 #vaccine you don’t get to have the same privileges the rest of us do. We have rights too—not to be sickened by you!
105407	@Tickittybooboo @linda__lou @Mandy1258 @peacelilly44 it's worrying this new variant of Covid-19 let's hope the new vaccine will still protect us from it the scientists are quite optimistic about it, I hear they're working on a nasal spray vaccine that will be good for the children fingers crossed it's rolled out 😊👍🤞🙏💙x
107173	@mlchealth @LAMcbelfast When do partners of the clinically extremely vulnerable get the vaccine? they where priortised for the flu vaccine so why not the Covid19 Vaccine.
106546	@NewYorker This is the scariest article I’ve read in a very long time! Since flu vaccines for each year are made from data taken the year before (because the flu virus mutates), what hope is there for an effective Covid19 vaccine to be available before mid 2021?😰
105290	This fucker is one of the reasons why poor countries cannot fabricate their own vaccines so we can vaccinate the world. He needs to be taxed to hell, and then some.

106089	1. How do I get the vaccine? Do I tell my doctor I'm a teacher?2. When do I get the vaccine? Before I go back into the classroom?3. What about other education professionals? For example, EAs and ECEs also work very closely with students.#OntEd #OnPoli
105865	"""@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Awesome. How soon will we be back to the 5 cases he promised? How soon until we get to the """"everyone who wants a test gets a test"""" that he said we already had? Does he still think an influenza vaccine will work on a coronavirus?"""
107271	New vaccine they are saying it will take months to roll-out I say it will take years, there are approximately 64.8 million people in the UK work it out...
106855	No one could die for a month and we would still have a second wave just like the first one it didn't happen. They lied about everything. This is about the vaccine that's all wake up people. And I still don't know anyone who has had covid19.
106454	I already have no plans on getting this vaccine because I have common sense. But do they really think THIS is going to get more people to get it? Let’s be real, the people who look up to these shitbags are the ones who already got the vaccine.
106986	transmitted by a bat, it is probably from this that they started, then they modified it. Maybe they wanted to make an AIDS vaccine using a coronavirus as an antigen carrier. A work of sorcerer’s apprentices can be said. Because we must not forget that we are in the world of
107237	@WashTimes In the end 20 years down the road you will see commercials on TV about anyone who has taken the coronavirus vaccine or who has died from it or has gotten sick call the law offices for compensation. Something to think about when you get that 1st injection.

107039	@eddiefcoffey @Gypsygoddess1 @NorthElstew @LOXandBAGELS909 Small pox is a real vaccine. We have only a therapeutic in Covid shots. If they could have a real vaccine for covid-19 they could have a real vaccine for the common cold. I doubt that will happen. Just my personal opinion.
106525	You're going to be put on a list if you refuse to take the vaccine that does nothing but make you sterile.
105313	@Independent I’m not an antivax, I hope we’ll get soon an effective, safe vaccine for #COVID19 but this Labour call for censorship really explains what Labour has become under Sir, an authoritarian, undemocratic, dangerous party

106144	@NBCNews @GavinNewsom Why receive a vaccine for a virus with a 99%+ survival rate, if it is still not clear wether you can still get infected afterwards?
107642	I just cannot get over what a shithead our governor is. He doesn't present a coherent plan of any kind for vaccine roll-out and then when hospitals understandably are chaotic in getting the vaccine out there, he punishes them. This guy MUST be a one-term governor. Outrageous.

107040	Misleading.If a vaccine was going to be available by that date we'd know.Trump may try and get part's of trial's skipped and fast track one.This is to set up a system as to how a vaccine will be distributed.Who first and so on.I don't have any trust in CDC.This is bull.
107491	@gator_gum I think the provincial governments are hoping they can vaccine their way out of Covid-19 without having to admit it is airborne. The government wouldn’t like the investments that are needed if they admit it is airborne.
107429	To all those pushing for the elderly to get the vaccine before the healthcare workers who are actually working with COVID-19 patients, even if the elderly get vaccines now it won't be safe for you to expose them on Christmas -- it takes three weeks plus another injection first.
106179	Also thanks for the friendly reminder my friend... The vaccine will not replace what we do everyday. We still have to do it until everyone gets vaccinated.
106395	The Oxford vaccine is safe and immunogenic. Now we need to know how effective it will be in reducing the risk of contracting COVID
105208	@DaveColan That’s not even a comparable statement whatsoever. Drunk driving is illegal. Getting a vaccine is a choice. If you think not getting a COVID-19 vaccine is the same as drunk driving you really need to re-evaluate your thought process as a whole.
107578	@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump The vaccine will only work when people can get it. Eight months after this began &amp; the average American still can’t buy a disposable n95 mask. You expect me to believe Trump could manage distribution of a #coronavirus vaccine that requires 2 doses?Gaslighters gonna #gaslight.
107379	Americans be like: my body my rules I’m not growing a third nipple, btw vaccines give u autism and turn u into a hairy latino
105613	Our very trustworthy political leaders will get on national television and be administered a vaccine so that the people will gain trust in the vaccine. Sounds legit, hope the CDC has a whole link on how it's safe since Pence and Biden took it
107302	Some physician in Italy refused the Covid vaccine. The answer to this is very simple: find another job because you will not be an MD anymore. #COVID19 #italy
107169	The Brits.  The don't want to wear masks, the don't properly lockdown, no quarantine, no social distance. And now they don't want to use a vaccine. 👀👀👀
106593	@guide_late @ethrop @The_RyN_2k @mamahibou @cyung5 It is not stoping the pandemic.. it’s a corona virus.. read up on them.. lots of coronavirus studies.. they mutate, it’s what they do, regardless of the vaccine and the vaccine does not prevent infection or spread of the virus.. so no social benefit to the vaccine
107634	@MurkeNyou @mesosuchus @Ned_the_zombie @TitusNation Nope. The technology is not new, I never claimed that. But the actual pharmaceutical is new. It was developed last year. They did not have the genomics sequence for COVID-19 until the epidemic started. They could not make the vaccine until having that You lose.
106474	I would like to give people the covid19 vaccine so when my son grows up, I can tell him that I helped in saving the world.
105776	Virus may not be inactivated? Are you kidding me? Is that even a question to be asked? it’s the only bloody thing that differentiates a vaccine from the virus it is seeking to tame. Why isn’t this being investigated on a war footing?
107423	@SkyNews @SkyRhiannon Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don’t know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
106485	@jackiebarbosa @GavinNewsom @laurakcurtis FACT - Covid-19 is in the human pop. 4 good, fast or slowFACT - mask wearing only slows it down; it can't stop itFACT - herd immunity doesn't mean that no one will ever catch it again, it just reduces the likelihoodFACT - there has NEVER been a vaccine for a coronavirus. EVER.
106502	Over reaction to this omicron is remarkable.  $PFE just said vaccine is 90% effective.  Vaccines are safe and effective we’ve been told.  This strain is less virulent we’ve been told.  What is going on here?
107662	This is the only reason I will not take these vaccines... I can't even sue the Gov or the manufacturers of these vaccines I it happens I get  any complications after vaccination. 🙄🙄🙄

105224	@toadmeister @allisonpearson So the vaccine doesn’t work then? Everyone will have had their first jab by July during the summer when coronavirus is less prevalent.  Vaccine must be useless.

105430	@ImperialWick I was on Facebook talking to people.  Majority get flu vaccines, pneumonia shots, etc.   A few like me don't think they really help.  So many believe everything their doctor recommends.  I do my own research.  After all, it's my body, not the doctor's.
105959	@WildEagle @StevenWallman @CBCAlerts Meh. I care about myself. I got COVID-19 and recovered and still have the antibodies (strong) 14 months later. Resistance baby. Don’t need vaccines or masks I can parrrrrttttyyyyyyyy!!! Just don’t get in my way ❤️😊
105926	"@ProfLWiley The vaccine position is a compromise with the ""we all need to get COVID19 ASAP"" and the ""we need to treat this like the 200 other respiratory viruses in circulation and do nothing about it,"" who see any change from 2019 behavior as an attack on them and their rights."
107148	@LiangRhea I have dilated cardiomyopathy so each Covid19 vaccine has been interesting. Stuck in bed for a week, but the booster may be my mildest reaction yet 😴 Hope you recover soon.
107605	That's me getting my vaccine in 2026 If I'm lucky!! The irish vaccine roll out the usual carry on by government. 🐌 #bottomofthelist
105318	Don't worry black people. Take the vaccine. It's not like they put something in it to control our population. Why would they create something that sterilizes you. It's never happened in history. Of course this is sarcasm.
107385	@ccrazy45 @DanCrenshawTX Go with what your doctor says. Believe it or not, they’ve been working on coronavirus vaccines for 10 years, they just needed the sequencing of this particular novel virus. FDA approved, and very effective. But, again, w/o knowing past health issues, go with your doc’s advice. ✌🏻
105802	@Sandancer60 @barbara45742047 The AZD1222 vaccine is a replication-deficient simian adenovirus vector, containing the full‐length codon‐optimised coding sequence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The next time they encounter any Coronavirus, such as the common cold, they will likely experience a cytokine storm.
107236	@RepAndyBiggsAZ @JuliansRum Covid 19 is merely a new chest cold. A new coronavirus along with the 4 coronavirus' we've dealt with every year. Never been an effective vaccine against those 4 and won't somehow be a miraculous vaccine for Covid 19. Wake up. We were all played; but playtime is now over.
106078	In the USA, giving free COVID- vaccines, along with a mug of beer.In India, charging Rs. 780 for the COVID vaccine, no free vaccine..why are they charging? I still didn't get even my first vaccine#COVID19 #COVIDIndia
106532	@CheriJacobus @JoeBiden @BruceBartlett Please stay home Cheri, thanks. When Gates’ coronavirus vaccine is available please get it. We want you “ safe”.
107069	As for the covid vaccine here's what I think I think it will help to a certain extent but it won't prevent you from getting coronavirus it will help with the symptoms and that's about it. But you still can get it and this still needs to be resolved accordingly
107130	OK if this guy is saying that the pandemic won’t Solved by the vaccine. Sounds to me like a threat. We need to keep an eye on what’s going on in the world.

106288	Ok, so watching nurses get their first coronavirus vaccines is unexpectedly making me tear up. I think my employer is starting vaccinations on Wednesday, with me probably getting it on Thursday?  I think.
105516	My college is offered extra does of the Moderna shot last night for those in pierce county! if you can, get your vaccine now! #VaccinesWork #vaccinatewa
106995	Morning after receiving the 1st round of COVID-19 vaccine, the only side effect is my arm is a little sore. Just the same the flu vaccine. Still able to complete my shoulder workout this morning, so not a big deal.
107082	Herd immunity will be with us soon with 10 Million people in London only half following the rules. Vaccine will not stop coronavirus we must all move on. And get back to normal after Brexit.
107256	@nopicnicshere @NotBoise @broxygoose @gofasterandfast @samanthamarika1 So many of us. I had COVID-19 I did not need hospital treatment and am fine. I did not get vaccine and am not planning to. I trust my natural immune system.
107507	@yonalunsky @beccapauls @ReadyForMyShot It was no problem getting my first Covid-19 vaccine. I had no problems afterwards.
105947	@steved76152722 @Jessmaster88 @Ocugen We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies. Ask the FDA about it.
107119	WH MUST stay out of scienceThis just undermines any credibility the vaccine may have.I for one would not take the vaccine as isAnd I pray that we get the vaccine and quicklyJust wrong and playing w our lives
105284	@aubrey_huff It should be made illegal! They dont require that for any other vaccine and they certainly shouldn't for the coronavirus vaccine either
106207	@WillBlackWriter You do understand this is a mRNA vaccine?  If you have already had Covid-19 and survived your body has produced the exact same Covid protein as the vaccine is intended to stimulate to produce.  These idiots should really do their research.
106450	If a #COVID19 vaccine is approved in 2020, 65% of U.S. voters surveyed believe it would be rushed without enough testing and 58% said they would wait to get the shot, while 21% said they would never get it, according to a Sept. 6 CBS News poll.#vaccines #FDA #pharma #biotech
107315	If the vaccine works as advertised, then we should not fear the unvaccinated.   If the vaccine does not work, then why are we mandating it? #COVID19
106706	@anxious_Winter2 I had the Moderna vaccine. The needle they use is very thin—it caused no pain. For a day or so after the shot, I had arm soreness and a slight fever. I also felt great relief knowing I and my loved ones were much less likely to get seriously ill from the 2019 coronavirus.
106775	@Ali34351471 @JamesMelville My immune system has looked after me very well so far. I don't need a vaccine for a coronavirus with an exceptionally low mortality rate. They can shove it.
106867	@GOP The truth is #Trump has absolutely nothing to do with the vaccine! It is our vaccine from Germany! Yes, if you @GOP gang hadn't spread lies about the Covid19, 800,000 Americans wouldn't have died! Period!
105602	Why are #Medical #personnel being injected with either empty syringes or ones with a retractable needle? Why do they fear the #vaccine? #COVID19 is not a dangerous disease so they know that no #Vaccination will do any good #cdnpoli They are #antivaxxers #bcpoli #onpoli
106090	The first person to take the COVID19 trial vaccine in the United Kingdom has died!!!#COVID19 #3rdmainlandbridge #COVIDー19 #Qanon#4thmay #lockdown #ufo2020 #Health #GatesOfHellA trial is already claiming a life, imagine what the actual poison will do...
106742	@ryanstruyk @CNN @JohnsHopkins If China created COVID-19 why wouldn’t they create a vaccine before releasing it? Could China already have a vaccine to protect their communist elite???
105266	"I keep seeing ppl say ""wheres the cure for the Coronavirus don't let the scientist fool u. We have a serious problem and It might take months to slow the spread. It took us like 5 years for a vaccine for SARS which is a different form of coronavirus so good luck with that cure"
106299	I believe in opening up America but I also believe in mandating strict adherence to the CDC safety guidelines for COVID-19 and that all people should probably get the vaccine not be mandated to get it but do it on their own
106933	Since 1921. So why does everyone think a vaccine for COVID-19 is going to be some kind of cure all for the virus. The virus will most likely never go away. If you want to listen to an expert on how to avoid getting the virus, listen to someone speaking on building...
201583	seems like I'm one of the lucky 275,000 Australians that have been fully vaccinated against #COVID19 out of a population of 20,000,000 plus according to my Covid Certificate I received today after my last jab (via myGov) WTF @ScottMorrisonMP this is not good enough #AstraZeneca
106656	@JohnMappin China figured out how to make a perpetual coronavirus that is attacking the world, which they have the vaccine for, but will never share until submission.This type of Warfare is Democrat/Deep State approved.Time to start busting some heads. Count me in @realDonaldTrump
105385	@TeamPelosi There is a vaccine against the Coronavirus, China has it, it does not say it because it would accept that it is guilty of spreading the Chinese virus
106016	A reporter just asked Gladys: “Why are unvaccinated aged care workers still in the system?” The #media are helping the government push mandatory vaccination to the point where if you don’t get it you’ll lose your job.Shame on them. #auspol #COVID19 #vaccine
106096	We NEED everyone that can be vaccinated to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Protect your family. As soon as you are able to get the vaccine, don’t hesitate.
106380	@JimmyLloyd20 Hey Jimmy. I took the coronavirus vaccine yesterday. I'm diabetic and my mother advised me to. Anyway I have a questionIs it normal to feel soreness near the injection site?
105538	Hey Boris, I will go get my vaccine (Not a phucking chance) if you tell the Nation how many people died FROM covid? Remember not WITH, tell them how many actually died from covid.. I will wait as I know everyone will want to hang you when they know. Psss it only a few hundred...
105261	@joaomtcosta @helopait @DrTomFrieden Why haven’t they ever developed a Coronavirus vaccine do you think?  Why????????  Think????  It mutates too fast/often.  Anti-vaxxers aren’t the problem.
107221	All these coronavirus stock will go to 2 dollar No vaccine will be effective Eventually all will develop antibody on their own if they don’t already have

106281	The @AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is beginning to sound like an @Apple IOS update. One has to wait for others to try it before one realises it there are bugs to sort out. 😳🤔#AstraZeneca #Luxembourg#UOT#CovidVaccine#COVID19UG
106970	There is evidence that Hydroxychloroquine and Dexamethasone are effective...there is no money in that though! To date there is NO vaccine for any coronavirus, so what confidence can we have that there can be an effective one for Covid19 -  in a very short timescale?🤔
107588	No 😐.(Why is anyone getting the vaccine before #HealthcareHeroes? Why did #OJSimpson get it? Has everyone that works with the public gotten it, yet? How are #smokers a priority? Why has only 2% of the population gotten it? Why can't they figure this stuff out?)
106557	Why would I give my children and experimental vaccine for a curable infection?  If you would have listened to our President we would have seen this gone in weeks after initial exposure.   The dems are going to try to get segregation one way or another.
106355	What the hell kind of statement is that from Franklin? Who says they'll get any vaccine they'd give me? That's just plain lunacy.
105325	@gabrielyanrob USA is NOT a dictatorship and NO WAY will they make covid19 vaccine mandatory! That’s unconstitutional &amp; mentally and PHYSICALLY abusive to enforce it on everybody! 😤😠Let those people get it who want to, and healthcare workers need to get it since they work with sick patients!

105825	@wave3news So here's another push by this in power to get vaccinated, but why? If it's a new variant, how can there already be a vaccine for it? The old vaccines are not going to be effective, yet they're pushing us to get jabbed now! Why? #vaccination #lies #COVID19 #control
106625	I think there will be a vaccine. The question is whether it will be safe and effective or just another con like Trump University. I am betting on a con that will result in even more deaths.
106533	Because vaccines aren't a magic talisman? They don't make you immune to Covid, they just give your immune system a better chance of fighting off an infection should it occur. This is literal 6th grade science stuff.
106787	The coronavirus is a VIRUS, not unlike the common cold (rhinovirus) (I AM NOT A DOCTOR SO I COULD BE WRONG, DON’T @ ME).There’s no vaccine for the cold. Y’all really need to shut the fuck up about a magical vaccine, because I’m really fucking tired of hearing about it.
105882	Grown people in America can't comprehend the damage that their opposition to vaccines has caused.They don't get it that this virus is mutating weekly.Conditions change for US all weekly.Stop complaining about something antivaxxers have caused.Do what you should. Mask and vax.
106302	The vaccine isn’t an immunisation. Every winter the NHS is in crisis. Fix the NHS. Oh and the vaccine doesn’t stop you catching or spreading the virus it’s just meant to stop you being poorly enough to go in hospital
201673	@darakass I'm pro-vaccine and am fantasizing about a COVID19 vaccine daily but I won't trust a Nov 1st vaccine.

105341	@jw_wilkerson @_StephanieMyers @OANN Are you telling me i have a greater risk of dying from this vaccine than the actual coronavirus. Hahaha. No thanks. This is hilarious why would i take the vaccine. Im going to say its against my religion
106465	I say this to the person who seemed proud of having gone 46 years without a flu shot, are you going to refuse the COVID-19 vaccine when it comes out?I said I get the flu shot for myself and because my MD demands it and these are true BUT I also get it so that I don't
106257	"""X number of people still haven't gotten the vaccine"" But do they want the skunk vaccine? They want the vaccine made for animals?? I thought we were done taking medicine made for our furry friends"
106388	Though the threat of Covid-19 is real enough, why is SA and other countries being pushed into taking the vaccine, when China the origin of it all recovered using herd immunity?
106398	@LebienHeure @guardian If you didn't need to get a flu jab every three months, why would you need to get Covid-19 boosters this frequently? It makes zero sense.
105857	@DHSCgovuk @MattHancock We not be able to get a vaccine for the coronavirus been trying for years yet in 7 months you've managed to get one for covid19. No liability clause too. Yeah right! There has been no long term studies so how do we know what the effects are after 1 to 2 years.
107670	Hmmm so children should take a vaccine they don’t need for a virus the vulnerable are protected from just because adults say so....? Not the best lesson to teach kids.
